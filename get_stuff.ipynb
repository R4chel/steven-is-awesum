<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/04/16/cat-out-of-the-bag-2-1/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p><em>Overshoot, </em>Percy mused.\\xa0 <em>A species finds itself with no predators and an abundance of resources.\\xa0 The species grows by leaps and bounds, oftentimes exponentially, and quickly reaches a point where it vastly exceeds the space and resources available.</em></p>\\n<p>Percy held his umbrella up at an angle, pointing it against the rain that was driving down, now.\\xa0 His eye fell on the Academy.\\xa0 This late in the evening, it was one of the only points of light in this dark little city, walled in, with enough lights around the Hedge that the front wall was illuminated.</p>\\n<p>He turned away, shifting his grip on his umbrella.\\xa0 His free hand reached up to tenderly prod his own damaged face.\\xa0 The moment he\\u2019d been hurt, he\\u2019d chosen to exaggerate the severity of it.\\xa0 He\\u2019d trusted his Mary.</p>\\n<p>His walk was brisk.\\xa0 Running was a giveaway, walking was too slow.\\xa0 He compromised on both fronts.\\xa0 Living here, one got used to the rain, walking on slick sidewalk and road.\\xa0 The Academy had wanted rain, they had devised a method to get it, algae that were now part of the water system.\\xa0 Buildings at the periphery of Radham spouted out fumes that would catalyze the bacteria.</p>\\n<p>When Overshoot occurred, the end result was often a devastating collapse of the system that had formed.\\xa0 Populations often died <em>en masse.</em></p>\\n<p>The wind nearly tore his umbrella from his hand.\\xa0 He had to pause to fix the arm at one side, where it had inverted, turning one side of the umbrella into a cup rather than a shield.\\xa0 While he did so, he took the opportunity to glance over his shoulder, double-checking.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t see anyone that shouldn\\u2019t be there.\\xa0 He kept a particular eye out for children, and saw nothing.</p>\\n<p>He felt both relief and disappointment.\\xa0 To see Mary there would have lifted his heart and it would have made him feel safer.\\xa0 To see all of the boys with Mary would have left him ecstatic.\\xa0 Given him hope.</p>\\n<p>Only rain and shadow in equal proportion.</p>\\n<p>Radham worked so hard to portray itself as something good and proper.\\xa0 He\\u2019d known that much already, spending the better part of six years at Mothmont, but he\\u2019d never been one to wander the street in the worst weather.\\xa0 He\\u2019d been aware of the existence of such stitched, but he\\u2019d never seen how many stitched were active late at night, collecting trash, bodies, or simply going about on predetermined errands, especially now that he was in the shadier part of Radham.</p>\\n<p>A stitched was picking through a can of trash that had been left outside of a business, moving as though drunk, too loose, prone to swaying.\\xa0 When it found something, a broken clock, a child\\u2019s toy, a pair of scissors, it fumbled to fold back a waterproof cloth that had been draped over a crate, placed the item inside, and then replaced the cloth.</p>\\n<p>Percy wanted to help it.\\xa0 To give it an hour of his time, or find its owner and tell them how to maintain it better.\\xa0 Some individuals were prone to complaining about how their relatives, friends and neighbors were collected before they ever touched a coffin, or dug up at the first opportunity by grave robbers looking to make some coin by selling to would-be-students.\\xa0 Oh, but if they knew that stitched were sometimes used like this, ordered to go through garbage for anything that might be of value, taking the materials to a location where the valuables could be sorted out and sold?</p>\\n<p>A stitched wasn\\u2019t easy to make, but the attempted and ultimately partial revival of the dead had been one of Wollstone\\u2019s first projects, and had consequently been one of the most detailed in Wollstone\\u2019s literature.\\xa0 All one had to do was obtain the materials that the Academy controlled and follow the documentation to the letter.</p>\\n<p>The materials were inexpensive, the end product lasted years, longer if kept dry and maintained at the right temperature, which this poor thing wasn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>He appreciated few things more than <em>good work</em>.\\xa0 A craftsman with care regarding their trade.\\xa0 This wasn\\u2019t that kind of good work.</p>\\n<p>The creator no doubt had access to a great many bodies, and thought it easier to go to a third-rate Academy graduate and have another made, than to work to keep this one functioning.</p>\\n<p>Flesh was cheap.\\xa0 Dead flesh cheaper.</p>\\n<p>The stitched turned its head, looking in Percy\\u2019s direction.\\xa0 The eyes were nearly gone, the pupils and irises clouded with milky white.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t, however, looking at Percy himself.</p>\\n<p>He followed the gaze of the stitched creature, and he saw two figures in the rain.</p>\\n<p>The first and most obvious was a monster.\\xa0 Four-legged, It stood tall enough that if it walked against a building, its shoulder would brush the upper end of a doorframe, but it was narrow enough that it could fit through the doorway itself, if it ducked its head down.\\xa0 It had parts of a human face, writ large, the features largely concealed by long black hair.\\xa0 Here and there, where flesh wasn\\u2019t sufficient, large amounts of metal had been set in place, fixed to flesh and bone.\\xa0 Light from a streetlamp reflected green in its eyes.</p>\\n<p>The other figure was a man, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a long jacket. The light from the streetlamp reflected green in <em>his</em> eyes as well.\\xa0 He carried a stick with a collar fixed to one end, ready to snap shut once touched to the throat, a bear trap without the teeth.\\xa0 Sometimes it had spikes, Percy knew, but no.</p>\\n<p>No, Dog and Catcher wanted him alive.\\xa0 To question.\\xa0 To take his work, repurpose it.\\xa0 It was only a matter of time.\\xa0 The only reason they hadn\\u2019t noticed him was that they were distracted by something else.\\xa0 It seemed Catcher was saying something, though the collar of his jacket was high enough to hide his mouth.</p>\\n<p>Dog nodded, and the sound he made in reply was deep and loud enough to be almost audible.\\xa0 Speaking was impossible for the thing, given the mangled metal wreck that was his lower jaw.</p>\\n<p>How could Percy even describe the feeling that came over him, then?\\xa0 The <em>dread</em>, the misery.\\xa0 He imagined the feeling being very much like what he might experience if confronted by the family of the children he had replaced with his own.\\xa0 If he had been cut down mid-stride, before accomplishing his goals.</p>\\n<p>As if a weight had been dropped on him from high above, smashing all he was to pieces, while leaving his body intact.</p>\\n<p>But dread didn\\u2019t help him.\\xa0 He circled the garbage-scrounger and used the creature\\u2019s bulk and smell to hide him from sight and nose.</p>\\n<p>With a note of regret, he folded up his umbrella, subjecting himself to the rain.\\xa0 Bone handle, properly waterproof.\\xa0 Too large to go in the crate, too obvious a thing to be carrying.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope your master rewards you by tending to you,\\u201d Percy murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cSo please forgive me for this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He pulled the waterproof cloth away from the top of the crate, where it protected the contents, threw it over his head and shoulders, then hefted the crate.\\xa0 He contemplated kicking off his boots, but decided against it.</p>\\n<p>Visually, it would mask him from their view.\\xa0 But their <em>eyes</em> were the least of his problems.</p>\\n<p>They could see better than him, they could track scents as well as any bloodhound, they could hear, as rumor went, a leaf settling on the ground, and they had the wits to use that information.</p>\\n<p>If they were this close, they had his scent, and if they had his scent, that mancatcher was as good as around his neck.</p>\\n<p>A sound behind him almost made him startle, but jumping or jerking could well be a giveaway.</p>\\n<p>Dog disappeared into an alley, traveling parallel to him.</p>\\n<p>Percy stumbled forward, box in hand, his thoughts a dull roar.\\xa0 There were no good options.\\xa0 Even if Mary or Clyde were here, the best they could hope to accomplish would be buying time.\\xa0 If the stars aligned right, perhaps they could put down Catcher.</p>\\n<p>But victory wouldn\\u2019t happen.\\xa0 Escape was out of the question.</p>\\n<p>Dog revealed himself by making a clatter, three floors above the ground, walking on a nearby rooftop.\\xa0 With each step, shingles broke free and skidded down the roof to sail toward the ground below.</p>\\n<p>There were only three building lots between Percy and the war machine.\\xa0 It had stopped at the end of one rooftop, and now strained, head raised, broad, bat-like nostrils flaring.</p>\\n<p>Dog almost casually leaped from rooftop to road.\\xa0 Metal braces in and around the legs locked, sprung, and slammed into new configurations, absorbing some of the impact.\\xa0 Muscle and mass handled the remainder.</p>\\n<p>Now that Dog was closer, Percy could see how tubes ran up and around the legs, disappearing into metal-framed slits in the side.\\xa0 Two tubes carried blood, while the third carried what might have been water.</p>\\n<p>Dog was an ugly piece of work, which was odd, considering that Dog was one of the best known of the Academy\\u2019s \\u2018secret\\u2019 projects.\\xa0 There were experiments that were done with care, thought through from the beginning.\\xa0 This was not that.\\xa0 It was a project that had been started, one largely doomed to failure.\\xa0 When structural integrity had failed, crude metal engineering had been set in place.\\xa0 When circulation was poor, things were rerouted, tubes set in place to serve where veins and arteries couldn\\u2019t, sometimes outside the body.</p>\\n<p>Little doubt there were other problems.\\xa0 The Academy was probably <em>happy</em> that was the case.\\xa0 A Dog couldn\\u2019t run if it needed regular drainage or a specialized diet.</p>\\n<p>The Academy had overshot.\\xa0 In this case it had made effective use of that fact.</p>\\n<p>Dog turned his head, staring at Percy with those eyes that caught the light, the eyelids moved, providing a smile the mouth couldn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>It was fruitless to resist, or even try to run, but it galled Percy to know that it would be <em>this</em> that ended him.\\xa0 He turned and prepared to go, when he saw Catcher drawing near.</p>\\n<p>The man toyed with the mancatcher, the collar on a stick.\\xa0 The collar section of the tool spun, whirling so fast it was a blur in the gloom, sending off a spray of water droplets.</p>\\n<p>Catcher\\u2019s voice was rough-edged, a man who had smoked or was speaking through a bad cold.\\xa0 \\u201cYou changed coaches twice, walked through deep puddles.\\xa0 Even wore a maggot-ridden blanket.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Maggots?</p>\\n<p>Percy pulled at the piece of cloth he\\u2019d put over his head, but it still took a second for his eyes to adjust.\\xa0 He saw the maggots wriggling, and flinched, casting the cloth away.</p>\\n<p>His <em>scalp</em> crawled, now, his neck and face.\\xa0 Once he felt it, every drop of rain he couldn\\u2019t verify with his eyes was potentially a maggot, vermin, filth.</p>\\n<p>Catcher shifted his grip on the mancatcher, and Percy stumbled back, only to find that Dog was behind him, mouth open, teeth ready to bite.</p>\\n<p>But he still held the crate.\\xa0 Using it for Dog would be useless, but-</p>\\n<p>Catcher thrusted, aiming for Percy\\u2019s throat, and Percy raised the box, the opening facing the weapon.</p>\\n<p>The crate was torn from his hands, thrown a distance away by a violent swing of the pole.</p>\\n<p>Too strong.\\xa0 Catcher alone would have been enough, but there were two of them.</p>\\n<p>Wollstone\\u2019s work had caught hold of him from an early age.\\xa0 It had defined his life.\\xa0 Now it would, in a roundabout way, end it.</p>\\n<p>He thought of his creations.\\xa0 Of Clyde, and of Mary.</p>\\n<p>In the same moment he realized his own mortality, he knew his legacy was gone.</p>\\n<p>He felt a flare of anger.</p>\\n<p>Percy nurtured the feeling, used it to find courage, and reached into his jacket for his pistol.</p>\\n<p>Catcher seized his wrist, then stopped, glancing down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was\\u2026\\u201d Catcher asked, trailing off.\\xa0 His head turned.</p>\\n<p>Dog growled, then darted off in the same direction.</p>\\n<p>A fog was rising around them.</p>\\n<p>No, it was a <em>gas</em>.\\xa0 Pea-soup thick, the cloud rose steadily despite the downpour.</p>\\n<p>Catcher started using his grip on Percy\\u2019s wrist to pull, tugging him away from the swelling cloud.\\xa0 Percy used his other hand to reach across his front for the gun, only to have Catcher move the mancatcher to prod his arm.</p>\\n<p>The collar, slightly too wide around for Percy\\u2019s upper arm, slammed shut.\\xa0 The hole was large enough that he could have pulled his arm free if he\\u2019d been given the chance, but he wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 The weapon rotated, the edges digging into his arm, and the implicit promise was that trying to pull free despite the pressure might see skin scraped away by the weapon\\u2019s edges.</p>\\n<p>Out of the same flame of anger that had driven him to reach for the gun, Percy found himself fighting Catcher.\\xa0 His opponent was strong enough to lift him, but Percy hauled himself downward, made every step a difficult one with one of his feet braced against Catcher\\u2019s thigh.\\xa0 He <em>strained</em> to move toward the gas that had alarmed these two abominations so very much.</p>\\n<p>It was stupid, reckless, and it was <em>ugly</em>, everything Percy had worked against.\\xa0 Every step of the way, he\\u2019d fought against the current, and every step of the way, he\\u2019d done things with care.\\xa0 Not all of it was things he could be <em>proud</em> of, but he\\u2019d weighed his options, and had never done a thing he felt he could later regret, in the grand scheme of it all.</p>\\n<p>Even his dealings with the children.</p>\\n<p>This, he instinctively felt, was something he might very well regret more than anything else, even if it only left him minutes or seconds more of life.</p>\\n<p>In the end, he succeeded.\\xa0 His head moved too far back, and the gas washed over his face.</p>\\n<p>In an instant, he was blind, seeing through a veil.\\xa0 Foul, acrid tastes and smells flooded his nose and mouth.</p>\\n<p>His struggles with Catcher continued, less effective now that he was blinded.</p>\\n<p>When he was dropped, he kicked and flailed into the blurry darkness.</p>\\n<p>When a hand pressed around his mouth, he struck out, hit flesh.\\xa0 He struck again, and felt long hair.</p>\\n<p>His hand moved more gently through the hair, with a degree of caution this time, with care.</p>\\n<p><em>Mary?</em></p>\\n<p>He opened his mouth to ask, but whatever it was that had filled it with foul taste, it was like a thick flour, caking his tongue and inner cheeks, making them stick to his teeth.\\xa0 His lips bound together, cracking and bleeding as he pulled them apart.</p>\\n<p>The hand over his mouth moved, until only one finger pressed against his lips.</p>\\n<p>The fingers seized his bleeding lower lip and <em>tugged</em>.\\xa0 Leading him like a mutt on a leash, and he knew it wasn\\u2019t his Mary.</p>\\n<p>He obeyed all the same.</p>\\n<p>A few staggering footsteps, not knowing where he was going.\\xa0 A ruckus occurred behind them.</p>\\n<p>The hand took his wrist, instead, and he followed, for what seemed like an interminably long time, but was likely only a handful of minutes.</p>\\n<p>The hand freed his wrist.</p>\\n<p>Another minute passed.\\xa0 He started to feel his heartbeat pick up.\\xa0 Fear, humiliation, worry.\\xa0 He was dirty, covered in maggots, bloody, and except for his silent companion, he was <em>alone</em>.</p>\\n<p>He heard a woman\\u2019s sigh, not one of exasperation, but relief.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s water,\\u201d she said, and her voice was muffled.\\xa0 \\u201cRight in front of you.\\xa0 Rinse your face, try to get your nose and ears as well, or you won\\u2019t see or hear very well for a long time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He obeyed, fumbling until he found the rain barrel.\\xa0 He made use of the water, rubbing at his eyes, only to pull away long strings of goop.\\xa0 It snapped before he could get much of it.\\xa0 He pulled away as much as he could, checked his vision, and still found it blurry.\\xa0 His second attempt suggested that absolutely none of it had dissipated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt uses the mucus membranes,\\u201d she explained.\\xa0 \\u201cBinds to to the mucus itself.\\xa0 You\\u2019re going to be congested, and you\\u2019ll be pulling gobbets of the stuff from your nose and mouth for a long time.\\xa0 Give it an hour or two and it\\u2019ll be more solid.\\xa0 The rinse is meant to clear things up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow long?\\u201d he managed.\\xa0 He still felt as though his tongue was coated in wax.\\xa0 He blinked and made out a raven-haired beauty in a close-fitting jacket.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLong enough you might worry I lied to you and that permanent damage was done.\\xa0 Wash with regularity, it will get better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He looked back over his shoulder.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re gone,\\u201d she reassured him.\\xa0 \\u201cIt affected them worse than it affected you.\\xa0 They still put up a fight, which I didn\\u2019t expect.\\xa0 I had three stitched with me, and Catcher took them to pieces.\\xa0 The Academy will diagnose the problem and mend those two within a day, and then they\\u2019ll devise a means to prevent it, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you saved me?\\u201d Percy asked.</p>\\n<p>He could make out enough of her face to see a smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou saved me, and you sacrificed three stitched and a trump card to do it.\\xa0 You\\u2019re with <em>them</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>For the first time since the anonymous note had informed him the Academy was coming for him, he felt himself relax a touch.</p>\\n<p>He dunked his face again, then shook it violently in the water, side to side, splashing, trying to free up any of the substance that might be clinging.</p>\\n<p>When he stood straight, he put his hands to his hair and then combed it with his fingers.</p>\\n<p>His vision was still only half of what it had been.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome,\\u201d she said, smiling.</p>\\n<p>The destination, as it turned out, was a nondescript store with an old cowboy\\u2019s hat over the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEver been to a place like this?\\u201d his companion asked, ascending the stairs ahead of him. \\xa0 She shot him a light smile over one shoulder.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI, ah, never have, believe it or not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI believe you,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re more the type to find someone of that calling and invite her to your place.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She knew him that well?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDuring daytime, no less,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Ah.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ve been watching me that well, then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe man that walks around your home outside of the school hours, pulling the cart?\\xa0 Ours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d reached the top of the stairs, two floors up, and reached a door with another cowboy\\u2019s hat above it.\\xa0 Rather than open it, his companion turned around, then wiped at his face, touching his hair.</p>\\n<p>His blood still pumping and face already hot from the humiliation of his futile struggle against Catcher, just after hearing intimate topics raised so readily, he felt more than a little flustered.</p>\\n<p>From the smile on her face, she seemed to know it.\\xa0 Perhaps she had been watching him even more carefully than he\\u2019d known.\\xa0 Enough to know he liked to be in control, to steer things, and she was denying him that chance.</p>\\n<p>Before he could ask a question, she opened the door.</p>\\n<p>The walls were draped with red velvet or silk or something very close to it, traced with gold.\\xa0 The pillars had branches reaching up and around them, and one branch had a small bird on it.\\xa0 The light was electrical, cast through red glass.</p>\\n<p>Scattered around the room, in a very haphazard fashion, there were eight or nine people in chairs, on couches, or standing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia,\\u201d an old man greeted her.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd Mr. Percy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCatcher and Dog were there.\\xa0 I used my blinding powder, they\\u2019ll know what it is for next time.\\xa0 Louis is going to tell you I didn\\u2019t let him set the Academy\\u2019s Dog on fire, but it seemed too risky.\\xa0 Every time we made a sound, Catcher would charge at us.\\xa0 I let the stitched make all the sounds they wanted, and we left.\\xa0 It was the best option, Catcher wasn\\u2019t slowing down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe doesn\\u2019t, that is his <em>design,</em>\\u201d the old man said.\\xa0 Percy blinked to try and get a better view.\\xa0 Changing his tone, the old man spoke again, \\u201cYou did well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Talking to me</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI failed.\\xa0 My creations are dead.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmm, I\\u2019m afraid so,\\u201d the old man said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe confirmed for ourselves.\\xa0 Three boys and a girl, killed by the Academy\\u2019s set.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy felt a wrench in his chest.\\xa0 He managed to keep his expression calm.</p>\\n<p>It was good.\\xa0 The deliberate act of control helped to center him.\\xa0 He felt more like himself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat were you doing?\\u201d a woman asked.\\xa0 She was surrounded by cages.\\xa0 The shapes within suggested birds.</p>\\n<p>Percy opened his mouth to answer, then shut it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou won\\u2019t say?\\u201d Cynthia asked, and her tone was teasing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou brought me here for a reason.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe did,\\u201d the old man said.</p>\\n<p>Percy chose his words carefully.\\xa0 \\u201cI feel as though I\\u2019m being judged.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe all are, always,\\u201d the woman with the birds said.\\xa0 \\u201cAre you weak, strong, useful, a fitting romantic partner, a friend, an enemy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll reword.\\xa0 I\\u2019m on trial.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d the old man said.\\xa0 \\u201cWrong word, that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt matters, what I say, how I say it.\\xa0 And don\\u2019t say it always matters.\\xa0 You know what I mean.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d the old man said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know.\\xa0 Tell us, what were you doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy remained silent, considering.</p>\\n<p>When Cynthia spoke, her voice was soft, but it wasn\\u2019t uncertain in the least.\\xa0 \\u201cThere is nothing you can say that is worse than saying nothing at all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy didn\\u2019t speak right away, but he did make the decision to speak.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not proud.\\xa0 I started out wanting to prove myself to them.\\xa0 I had an idea, I wanted to see it through, and show them that they were wrong to refuse it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour clones.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Percy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour work seemed impeccable, considering your limited access to Academy resources.\\xa0 They protect their texts and charts with a dangerous passion.\\xa0 It\\u2019s half of what Dog and Catcher do, rounding up those who have or copy the books.\\xa0 <em>Every</em> academy has projects that do, dressing them up as patriots and protectors of the Crown.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere were teachers who brought sections of the texts to the school.\\xa0 I caught glimpses, and I held phrases and numbers in my head until I could write them down, sometimes hours later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cImpressive,\\u201d a man in the corner said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy?\\xa0 You started out wanting to prove yourself to the Academy, then you started killings.\\xa0 To hurt Mothmont, and to hurt the Academy too?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo become Headmaster.\\xa0 Once I could dictate policy, I planned to mass produce.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMass produce clones?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy managed a smile with his cracked, gummed-up lips.\\xa0 \\u201cImagine, please, a new method of warfare.\\xa0 One where a single man or clone can infiltrate, they can target children, replace them, the clones would educate their new peers in how to act like children, and slowly but silently capture an entire generation.\\xa0 One command or order, all in one night, and an entire city would be brought to its knees.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do like this sort of imagining,\\u201d the old man said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Academy likes its weapons, as you saw with it\\u2019s pet Dog.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy didn\\u2019t like <em>my </em>weapon.\\xa0 Not because of what it was, but because they had a vision in mind, a group of children working together.\\xa0 My idea was too slow for Hayle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou wanted to make it work.\\xa0 The lives of children meant nothing to you, you sold them without a care as to what we were using them for?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Is it a trial after all?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe lives of <em>my</em> children mean something to me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you want revenge for them, Percy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen you\\u2019ll have it.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll carry out your plan.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey know how I operate.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll be checking, to be safe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet them waste their time, then.\\xa0 There are other routes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy narrowed his eyes, felt the film in them, and rubbed at one with the knuckle of his thumb.\\xa0 \\u201cOther routes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>In answer, Cynthia reached up and tapped one of the red lights.</p>\\n<p>Percy nodded in realization.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll be working together,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cTo create beautiful pieces of work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you\\u2019ll be doing it with more resources,\\u201d the bird woman said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhile staying well out of sight,\\u201d the old man said, with a little more emphasis.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sure you understand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy nodded slowly, taking it all in.\\xa0 He allowed himself a smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sure it won\\u2019t take much convincing to have you act against the Academy?\\u201d the old man asked.</p>\\n<p>Percy mused for a moment.\\xa0 \\u201cWhenever I think of the Academy, I think of the concept of the <em>Overshoot</em><em>.\\xa0 </em>You\\u2019re familiar with it, I presume?<em>\\u201c</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was a professor,\\u201d the old man said, \\u201cyou can trust I am.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy smiled a little.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re treading dangerous ground.\\xa0 Verging on collapse.\\xa0 Hayle sees it too, but he thinks he can make minds brilliant enough to solve the problem.\\xa0 I think he\\u2019s only going to wind up contributing to it.\\xa0 No, I most definitely don\\u2019t have a problem acting against them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The demeanor of the others in the room told him he\\u2019d passed his trial.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan I wash my face?\\u201d he asked, as others settled in, and the din of conversatino rose.\\xa0 \\u201cAgain?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis way,\\u201d Cynthia said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have a room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She led him to his quarters.\\xa0 His eyes went as wide as the blinding film let them.</p>\\n<p>A complete set of Academy texts.\\xa0 Large vats, sufficient to house a person.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe basin is this way,\\u201d Cynthia said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have an bathroom adjunct.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He almost didn\\u2019t hear her.\\xa0 His finger traced the closest vat.</p>\\n<p>He would create life, play the littlest of gods.</p>\\n<p><em>Clones</em>, he thought.\\xa0 <em>From Ancient Greek Klon-.\\xa0 Meaning Twig</em>.</p>\\n<p>He smiled at the thought, before going to wash his face.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/08/08/esprit-de-corpse-5-5/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo big issues,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore than two,\\u201d Helen observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo big ones,\\u201d I reaffirmed.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to get out of this with our skin intact, and we need to help the others.\\xa0 Only reason they haven\\u2019t come after us is they probably aren\\u2019t sure they can find the others once we\\u2019re dead.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey could torture us,\\u201d Jamie said, under his breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s probably in the cards, if they don\\u2019t get the results they want by waiting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGreat,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re not going to come after us here,\\u201d I said, \\u201cIf they\\u2019re patient enough to let things get this far, they\\u2019re patient enough to let us have a bite to eat.\\xa0 We bide our time, we make them wait, we see if they make a mistake.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re giving them time to get in position,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s fine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFine?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave him my best winning smile.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine.\\xa0 Really.\\xa0 They\\u2019re not going to close in on the others <em>that</em> fast.\\xa0 We wait.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m going to assume you have a plan.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-And,\\u201d he said, cutting me off, \\u201cDon\\u2019t correct me.\\xa0 Let me have this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled, shutting my mouth.</p>\\n<p>We reached the building, and we were mute as we waited in a long line.\\xa0 We ended up settling in at the corner, where the path to a restroom and a length of counter at one end of the kitchen gave us some more privacy than we might otherwise have, putting us another pace or two from the nearest tables.\\xa0 I took a seat by the window, so I had a glimpse of the street outside.\\xa0 Jamie did the same, sitting across from me, while Helen took the aisle seat, next to Jamie.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I looked out on the rain-stricken city, and the two of us saw the world in very different ways.\\xa0 It was handy, when we were on the lookout together.</p>\\n<p>I liked that, really.\\xa0 With our group being as diverse as it was, there were people who were more different from certain others.\\xa0 Gordon and I were one example.\\xa0 Could we work well together?\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 But even while I\\u2019d trust Gordon to hold my still-beating heart in his hand and treat it with the care it deserved, I knew that we were very different in how we saw the world and how we approached a situation.\\xa0 We were polar opposites in terms of our abilities, strengths, and weaknesses.</p>\\n<p>Put Mary and Gordon on the same task, and they matched each other\\u2019s stride well.\\xa0 Gordon and Helen, same thing.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I <em>should</em> have been opposites.\\xa0 We should have run counter to one another.\\xa0 I was the chaos that stood in contrast to his order, the haste to his slow and steady pace.\\xa0 He was gentler than I was.\\xa0 We worked together better than any of the other opposing elements among the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>That seemed important to me.\\xa0 As if somehow it would hold things together in a pinch.</p>\\n<p>The waitress came by, we made our order, and promptly delivered it.</p>\\n<p>I left Jamie to continue studying the outside, and turned my attention to the interior.</p>\\n<p>The tea house was a sad little affair.\\xa0 It was the sort of location where the youth might congregate in better times, boys and girls could meet for first dates, children could gather and cluster into booths, and the elderly might sit for hours at a time, enjoying the good weather if there was any to be had.\\xa0 A glass display window protected and showed off an assortment of sandwiches and baked goods, and kettles were perpetually boiling behind the counter.</p>\\n<p>But there were no youths besides us, there were no elderly.\\xa0 Whitney was a small town with a large town population in it, now, and that population consisted of soldiers and rebels, with a lot of angry people.\\xa0 The staff of the tea house was having trouble keeping up, and the food behind the display window was dwindling, with new food being placed within on a regular basis, only to be dismantled by the next collection of guests.\\xa0 It was less of an elegant, artistic construction than a wall being torn down a hair faster than it could be rebuilt.\\xa0 If the staff worked hard enough, they would manage to keep going until the day was done, then collapse from exhaustion before doing what they could to get ready for the next day.\\xa0 If they failed, then they would have to deal with wave after wave of disgruntled customers, men with a lot of repressed fear and anger due to the ongoing war.</p>\\n<p>The constant rain meant mud was constantly being tracked in,\\xa0 and the floor was only partially swept before something demanded the attention of the staff.\\xa0 The result was that dirt and debris collected in corners and at the edges of the floor, where the mops and brooms couldn\\u2019t quite reach.\\xa0 The staff wasn\\u2019t used to this kind of environment, and it was clearly getting to them.\\xa0 They were used to a relaxed atmosphere, one where they could chat with their more innocent customers, not a crowd of unsmiling men who gathered at the door, shuffling their feet and murmuring among each other until a table vacated or the line reached the counter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMiss,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cMiss?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen succeeded in getting the attention of the waitress.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to bother you,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s alright,\\u201d the woman said, offering Helen a tired smile that suggested it wasn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s demeanor was bright as she talked, pointing at her cake with her spoon.\\xa0 \\u201cI just wanted to say this is really very good.\\xa0 Would you pass my compliments on to whoever made it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The woman seemed to shed five years of age as she relaxed muscles in her face, neck, and shoulders.\\xa0 I really wondered if she might cry.\\xa0 She nodded, a little too quickly, and then said, \\u201cI will.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you!\\u201d Helen said, almost sing-song, to the waitresses\\u2019 back.</p>\\n<p>I broke my cookie in half before washing it down with a bit of tea.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how <em>I</em> get the reputation as the most evil member of the bunch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust saying,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat Helen said was <em>nice</em>,\\u201d Jamie said, jabbing me in the arm with his spoon.</p>\\n<p>I shook my head, very slowly.\\xa0 \\u201cNope.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNope?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m a student of the way humans work, and , and I think what Helen just did was worse than anything I\\u2019ve done in the last while.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen hummed happily, rocking left and right a bit as her legs kicked idly under the table.\\xa0 Jamie gave me a look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCould be what they need to keep going,\\u201d Jamie murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut it\\u2019s not.\\xa0 They\\u2019re finding their own ways to keep going.\\xa0 When you lift someone up, you have to let go of them.\\xa0 They might not have the strength to land on their feet when they get dropped,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t think these people have that strength.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a very dark view,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt would have been better to leave them alone than to remind them of what they don\\u2019t have,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s an even darker view,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to live in a world where everyone acts that way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That stung, more than I cared to admit.\\xa0 \\u201cNot everyone, not always.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut sometimes?\\xa0 Sometimes can\\u2019t say something nice and be kind?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t see why this is a point of contention,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s your perfect world, Simon?\\u201d Jamie asked, using the fake name he\\u2019d stuck me with.\\xa0 I wondered if he\\u2019d chosen it for a reason.\\xa0 Harkening back to the old days.\\xa0 \\u201cIf the big problems were fixed and everything was working the way it should?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat has nothing to do with it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut?\\xa0 What\\u2019s your perfect world?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed.\\xa0 \\u201cA world where everyone is surrounded by people who are striving to be their best, because we only grow as people when we\\u2019re around people who are equal to or better than us in intelligence, skill, and industry.\\xa0 It\\u2019s in stupidity and stagnation that we fail as a species.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut ethically?\\xa0 Morally?\\u201d he prodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI just gave my answer.\\xa0 In a perfect world, we\\u2019re all different, ethically and morally.\\xa0 We argue, we challenge each other, and everyone is working to make their ideas better and more\\u2026 <em>more</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA lot of hostility, arguments, competition.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing good awaiting us as a species if we lose that,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I broke off a small bit of my oversized cookie and popped it into my mouth.\\xa0 I chewed and swallowed.\\xa0 \\u201cStagnation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t help but notice you haven\\u2019t mentioned anything about the positive human relationships,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cOnly the confrontational ones.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHumans are a social species.\\xa0 Push us, pressure us, challenge us, and the weak elements will break apart, the stronger elements will band together,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWallace\\u2019s law, applied to a group,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t get me wrong,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not proposing something where we\\u2019re all supposed to act like animals, or that we should model ourselves after them.\\xa0 I\\u2019m saying humans are humans, and being human means struggling.\\xa0 In the course of those struggles, we form the strongest bonds.\\xa0 Could be us and a life and death struggle with a pair of people who want to stalk and kill us, or two people working in a tea shop in a town that\\u2019s gotten embroiled in a civil war.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeems like your worldview is a little bit, uh,\\u201d Jamie said, \\u201cConveniently <em>you</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course it is,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m <em>eleven</em>.\\xa0 Ish.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie rolled his eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s your worldview?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t let my answer bias you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t,\\u201d he said, staring out the window.\\xa0 \\u201cBut world peace would be nice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWorld peace would destroy humanity,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDo I need to get into how?\\xa0 Because-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t need to get into how,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI get it.\\xa0 I really do.\\xa0 I agree with you on a lot of things, believe it or not.\\xa0 That we need the challenge, that we have to surround ourselves with people that as as bright and talented as we are, if not <em>better.\\xa0 </em>I like the differences in people, ethically or otherwise- I wouldn\\u2019t be able to stand you if I didn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I kicked him lightly in the shin under the table.\\xa0 He kicked me, harder.\\xa0 I pinned his foot down with mine, and he relented rather than fighting to get it free, content with a one-for-one.</p>\\n<p>He spoke, adding, \\u201cBut if it came down to it, I\\u2019d rather have peace than war.\\xa0 Both would do us a lot of harm, but I\\u2019d rather the sleepy, apathetic sort of ruin to the violent sort.\\xa0 Especially if it means we can be gentle and kind and not worry about the damage you somehow do by acting nice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re different people like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a boring person.\\xa0 The most boring.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He stuck his tongue out at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStick out your tongue all you want, you\\u2019re still boring.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He ignored me,\\xa0 turning to Helen.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat about you, Helen?\\xa0 Worldview?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was hoping that being nice would get me another bit of dessert,\\u201d she said, looking in the general direction of the wait-staff.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you timed it differently, you might have,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut there isn\\u2019t much behind the display.\\xa0 Stuff is in the oven.\\xa0 They\\u2019re short, so it\\u2019s hard to justify.\\xa0 By the time the stuff comes out of the oven, they\\u2019ll be too busy, the comment will be mostly forgotten.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDang it,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave to say, that\\u2019s not a worldview,\\u201d Jamie muttered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is so,\\u201d Helen said, sounding offended.\\xa0 \\u201cEthics, morals?\\xa0 Everyone acts in certain ways because it gets us things.\\xa0 Some things are more basic than others.\\xa0 People want to eat, they want shelter, they want to be around other people\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I nodded.\\xa0 Helen was the most alien of us, and it was interesting to hear where she came from.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe act a certain way because it gets us those things.\\xa0 If we can\\u2019t act nice then nobody wants to give us those basics, like food.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou keep coming back to that,\\u201d Jamie murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cFood.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie and Helen were at odds, in a way, now that I thought about it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe build up this image and it\\u2019s all based around getting what we want.\\xa0 Everyone does it, they play along, and in a roundabout, complicated way, selfishness breeds connectedness,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 Jamie leaned over.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd your perfect world?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmm,\\u201d Helen smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cPerfect is complicated.\\xa0 Hard to explain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGive it a shot,\\u201d I prodded her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s\\u2026 beautiful is the best word to describe it,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEverything that isn\\u2019t necessary to getting what we want is gone,\\u201d she said, eyes closing, as if she was vividly imagining.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s an abundance of it all, thanks to <em>science.\\xa0 </em>Food is everywhere and it overflows and there\\u2019s nothing to worry about because we <em>have</em> and we <em>want</em> and we <em>take.\\xa0 </em>We\\u2019re, and by we I mean people, we\\u2019re everywhere and we spill over into one another and we\\u2019re all knit together, physically and mentally.\\xa0 It\\u2019s an exquisite landscape of things that don\\u2019t ever run out to see and touches and tastes and smells and mating and eating and mindless fighting and eating-mating and fighting-eating and fighting-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said, interrupting.\\xa0 I paused, then when I couldn\\u2019t think of what to say. \\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen reached down to her plate, used a fingertip to wipe up a bit of frosting, and popped it into her mouth, sucking it off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said, still at a bit of a loss for words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a mental image that\\u2019s going to be with me forever,\\u201d Jamie said, dropping his head down until his face was in his hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t see where ethics come into that world,\\u201d I said, more to see Jamie\\u2019s reaction than out of curiosity.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe closer you get to perfection, the further you get from ethics,\\u201d Helen said, as if it was common sense.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan we drop this?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSounds like something Ibott would say,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm,\\u201d Jamie cut in, before Helen could answer, putting a hand over her mouth.\\xa0 \\u201cCan we drop the topic?\\xa0 <em>Please?\\xa0</em> I\\u2019m sorry I brought it up.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s talk about the threats on our lives?\\xa0 The others?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can do that.\\xa0 Mustn\\u2019t break our Jamie, right Hel?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded, and Jamie dropped his hand.\\xa0 Helen smiled, leaned over, and gave Jamie a kiss on the cheek.\\xa0 Jamie didn\\u2019t react, except to glare at me, as if I was somehow to blame.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d I said, leaning back.\\xa0 \\u201cChanging the subject for Jamie\\u2019s sake.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWon\\u2019t help.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t forget it, as long as I live.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>With emphasis on the I, not live</em>, the thought struck me.</p>\\n<p><em>Damn it</em>, was my next thought.\\xa0 <em>Now I\\u2019m in a bad mood</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo of them.\\xa0 They clearly operate as a unit.\\xa0 One to flush us out, another to keep us moving.\\xa0 I\\u2019m betting the one in the kitchen left and circled around so she could track us.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a very Dog-and-Catcher vibe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHard to do in the rain,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe was sniffing.\\xa0 The rain would make tracking us by smell harder.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut not impossible, depending,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m going to assume it at least means she can\\u2019t track our trail all the way back to the others, because they wouldn\\u2019t be leaving us alive if she could.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMakes sense,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not well equipped to fight, and I don\\u2019t like the knives the man had,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we get in a bad situation, we run, we try to bait them into a situation where we can turn the tables, or we run.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said that twice,\\u201d Helen pointed out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI meant it twice.\\xa0 Very important,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they know who we are, they know who Helen is.\\xa0 The woman didn\\u2019t have a gun, and the man seems to prefer knives.\\xa0 That suggests they prefer close quarters.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey had a very feral vibe,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe had a heavy forehead, brutish, she had the mouth, the sniffing, and the hair\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Good, I like that line of thinking,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I can get my hands on one of them, I can probably win,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d prefer no knives, because some people are double-jointed, but I can probably win.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen we have a strategy,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to leave, and we cut through the spaces between buildings.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve done it a bit, I know the best shortcuts, we break away from them, bait them in, trap them if we can, sic Helen on them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWoof,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrouble is if they move as a pair, or one comes to relieve the other.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll have to work fast, Hel.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She pouted a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to find a means of communicating with the others.\\xa0 Objects can hold trace smells, allowing the sniffing woman to find us.\\xa0 That means our best bet is to use <em>people</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPeople?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMessengers.\\xa0 Ones that won\\u2019t have to go to them, specifically, and who can\\u2019t be effective witnesses.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s vague,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s <em>my</em> job.\\xa0 But I need elbow room to do it.\\xa0 That means putting a bit of space between us and them before I act.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich is also good for our lifespans,\\u201d Jamie murmured.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cAs for you, Jamie\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat can I do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInformation.\\xa0 Anything you can figure out.\\xa0 If we\\u2019re going to actively turn this around, instead of just dodging them, then we need to figure them out.\\xa0 We should figure out the people with the scars and boils on their bodies, and we need to know who Cynthia is.\\xa0 You\\u2019re our best bet at figuring this out, connecting the dots.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie leaned forward, arms folded on the table, and scooted his chair up.\\xa0 \\u201cOn that subject, you\\u2019ve reminded me, I think they\\u2019ve got a trump card.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn what sense?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy focus up until now has been on the strategy, the war overall, troops, who they\\u2019re sending, and where.\\xa0 Ames was a good source of information, but they started giving different people different details,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cTrying to catch us out by narrowing down the field.\\xa0 I caught on to it when details didn\\u2019t add up.\\xa0 They\\u2019re not scared enough, Sy.\\xa0 Westmore is a half day away, fully occupied by the Academy, and the people in charge here aren\\u2019t spooked about it.\\xa0 If you want to count stuff we should figure out and figure out soon, I\\u2019d put that on the list.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs it possible the scarred people are the trump card?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t know,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt didn\\u2019t look like it mattered, with Mary and Gordon placing the bugs, we were going to resolve the situation before anything happened.\\xa0 Now that we\\u2019re in a tighter spot\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I looked out the window.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre we going, then?\\u201d Helen asked, weirdly insistent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t look like they\\u2019re showing up.\\xa0 I was hoping they\\u2019d turn up and try to pressure us, force a move.\\xa0 Yeah, we\\u2019re going.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat would the plan be, if it came to that?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen asks the waitress for help, we appeal to genuine human nature, duck out through the back,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWith this many people in here, we could lose them, because they can\\u2019t track us effectively with this crowd.\\xa0 Buy ourselves a small head start.\\xa0 If we could find the other one while we did it and keep an eye on them, we could see how they communicated.\\xa0 Their dynamic, and so on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>Helen was already standing, and she reached for my plate, stacking it with hers and Jamie\\u2019s before gathering the silverware.\\xa0 She gathered the teacups as well.</p>\\n<p>While Jamie got his backpack and slung it over one shoulder, she took the plates to the counter, placing them in the bucket that was over the sink.\\xa0 She seemed too enthusiastic, bouncing in place, which was cause for me to watch her, even as Jamie and I headed for the door.</p>\\n<p>I saw her lean forward, talking to the server at the ovens.\\xa0 The woman smiled, grabbed a cookie, and put it into a bag, before handing it to Helen.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d waited until the ovens were done before asking if we were going.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Jamie and rolled my eyes.\\xa0 We\\u2019d slowed as we approached the cluster of men at the door.\\xa0 Most had rifles, some had Exorcists, many had pistols as secondary weapons, or belts with canisters dangling from them.\\xa0 Countermeasures against stitched and other experiments, I imagined.</p>\\n<p>I would have liked to grab the canisters, in hopes of getting something incendiary or something that might irritate the sniffing woman\\u2019s nose, but I wasn\\u2019t sure what the labels were supposed to mean, and I wasn\\u2019t sure how to unhook them.\\xa0 Uncertainty was the spice of life, so to say, but people didn\\u2019t tend to use phrasings like that when referring to that which <em>prolonged</em> life expectancy.</p>\\n<p>Helen caught up at a skip and a run, throwing her arms out to catch us around the shoulders.\\xa0 I was smaller, and I took the brunt of it.</p>\\n<p>My eye fell on one man in front of me.\\xa0 Boots were common, but boots with a sidearm clipped to the one side-</p>\\n<p>I let myself fall onto my hands and knees, driving one shoulder into the man\\u2019s calf.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cSorry, sorry, sorry!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave him my best \\u2018scared to death\\u2019 look, as he winced, backing away.\\xa0 I clambered to my feet, accepting Helen\\u2019s assistance.</p>\\n<p>As we exited the tea shop, I raised my umbrella.</p>\\n<p>There was a figure on the roof of a tool shop, hood up, face barely visible.\\xa0 By his frame, he was the man with the scarf.\\xa0 I pretended I didn\\u2019t see him and gestured to the others, indicating a hard right turn.</p>\\n<p><em>Make it as hard for them to follow as we can</em>.</p>\\n<p>I walked between Helen and Jamie, my eyes peeled.\\xa0 When I was sure we weren\\u2019t being observed, I pulled the pistol from under my shirt and handed it to Jamie, slipping it into a large raincoat pocket.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t react, but he had to have felt the weight.</p>\\n<p>Better that he had a weapon than me, if it came down to it.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t that I was a bad shot, but my tendency to overthink and self-sabotage in the process carried over to guns too.\\xa0 I could hit eleven out of twelve bottles from the big tree behind the Orphanage, using one of Gordon\\u2019s practice guns, but Jamie had a better record than I did when it came to actually shooting anyone.\\xa0 Reaction times could be better, but there were worse things.</p>\\n<p>Helen had a slim chance if it came down to a hand to hand fight.\\xa0 Jamie could use a gun.</p>\\n<p>It meant I didn\\u2019t have to worry so much about them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne on the right is pursuing,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNoted,\\u201d I responded.\\xa0 \\u201cHow far away is she?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe man from the upper floor in the banquet hall?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>He</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere was one on the roof, opposite the front door of the tea house,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMale.\\xa0 We\\u2019re up against three.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUnless someone felt like spending some time on the roof,\\u201d Helen said, brightly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe brings up a good point.\\xa0 It seems obvious,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWas he deliberately showing himself?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Was he?</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 It could have been part of their plan.\\xa0 Hang out in a spot where he wouldn\\u2019t be seen unless we were actively looking for people in unusual places.\\xa0 If we changed course\\u2026</p>\\n<p><em>Damn it.\\xa0 </em>I\\u2019d expected two.\\xa0 But they were herding us.\\xa0 Closing the net.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t let them herd us,\\u201d I murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we react to them, then we\\u2019re tipping them off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t react to them, then we\\u2019re playing into their hands,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, well, they\\u2019re probably specialists when it comes to this,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to change things up, adapt our plan.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p><em>That\\u2019s a good question</em>.</p>\\n<p>Give ourselves a headstart, pass a message to the others without getting caught, escape, reunite with the others.\\xa0 In an ideal world, we\\u2019d be able to gather information on this new enemy, and still put Mary and Gordon\\u2019s plan into action.\\xa0 Shipman\\u2019s weapon.\\xa0 Disable Whitney and whatever trump card they had.</p>\\n<p>I felt Jamie\\u2019s hand on my arm tighten.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t as fast to see what he saw, but it was a question of my being an inch or two shorter than him.</p>\\n<p>A man on the far side of the street, approaching.</p>\\n<p>He held his head at a strange angle, like his neck was broken, and a earlobes on already large ear dangled, a weight pinned to the bottom.\\xa0 He had unkempt black hair, an unkempt beard, and strangely spaced out features on his face, as if someone had grabbed the back of his head and pulled, everything back out of the way, eyes to either side, mouth down, nose flattened and broadened.\\xa0 He wore a soldier\\u2019s uniform, and he was weighed down with canisters.\\xa0 A length of chain was wound his right wrist and hand, and something that looked like a lantern dangled from the end of that chain, nearly touching the ground by his right foot, with spikes radiating from it.</p>\\n<p>Plumes of something were puffing out from the end, as it swung in time with each step of his left foot.</p>\\n<p>My arm at my side, I reached over, tapping the gun in Jamie\\u2019s pocket.</p>\\n<p>The three of us walked, eyes forward, pretending not to have noticed.</p>\\n<p>As carts and carriages passed up and down the street, a group of people blocked our view of the man for a few long seconds.</p>\\n<p>When they moved out of the way, he was gone.\\xa0 I felt Jamie\\u2019s grip tighten, but he wasn\\u2019t indicating anything in particular.</p>\\n<p>Just worry.</p>\\n<p>Helen reached for her bag and broke the cookie in half.\\xa0 She broke one half into two quarters, and held them out for Jamie and I.</p>\\n<p>Jamie took his bit of cookie, letting go of my arm.</p>\\n<p>I saw the man walking in the midst of a group of woodcutters, his hair and beard almost camouflaged among theirs, only his features standing out, and only barely then.\\xa0 Helen pushed the cookie at my mouth.\\xa0 I opened up and accepted it.\\xa0 The damn cookie was good, but I\\u2019d have to talk to her about things, after.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood cookie,\\u201d Helen said, as the man came to be about five paces away.\\xa0 Four.\\xa0 Three.\\xa0 \\u201cI really like-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t stop talking so much as <em>segue</em>.\\xa0 Switching modes, fast enough it caught <em>me </em>off guard, let alone our assailant.\\xa0 She ducked low, lunging at the man in the same instant he shoved the two men in front of him out of the way.\\xa0 He had the smoking lantern thing in one hand, clutched with spikes radiating out between fingertips, and was already swinging for Helen\\u2019s face- except she wasn\\u2019t there anymore.</p>\\n<p>Jamie didn\\u2019t miss a beat.\\xa0 He fired.</p>\\n<p>It was <em>loud</em>.\\xa0 People screamed, and they scattered.\\xa0 The lumberjacks around us backed away, ducking.</p>\\n<p><em>They realized we knew.</em>\\xa0 <em>They communicate without words, just as well as we do</em>.</p>\\n<p>Helen grabbed his arm, keeping it back and out of the way as he dropped to one knee.\\xa0 Jamie fired again, placing each shot into the center of the man\\u2019s body mass, carefully enough to avoid hitting Helen and I.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was slow, he lagged behind the rest of the world as he processed and studied everything.\\xa0 But with forewarning- well, he was keeping up.</p>\\n<p>A canister hanging off the man\\u2019s body took a bullet from Jamie\\u2019s gun and went spinning off.\\xa0 Thick black-grey smoke expanded out in the middle of the street.</p>\\n<p>I turned my attention to the others.\\xa0 Figuring out where the knife man and the one on the rooftop might have gone.\\xa0 I spotted the knife man with the scarf, approaching at a run.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNearest alley, go, go!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Achieved what we needed to achieve</em>, I thought.\\xa0 Slowing them down, passing on word to the others.\\xa0 When they heard that children had been involved in a gunfight, they\\u2019d know something was wrong.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t elegant, but it was <em>us</em>.</p>\\n<p>Damn all the other parts of the plan.\\xa0 It was worth nothing at all if the Lambs didn\\u2019t make it out okay.</p>\\n<p>The moment that thought was through my head, something struck me in the side, with surprising force.\\xa0 It felt <em>big</em>, like I\\u2019d been kicked by an oversized horse.\\xa0 My hand slipped from Jamie\\u2019s arm, and I felt Helen grab me, failing to stop me from falling belly first to the street.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d Jamie called out.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, no!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The two of them grabbed me, trying to help me stand.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t grasp why it was so hard, until I felt the pain in my side.\\xa0 A burning point of light, deep inside, a small pain.</p>\\n<p>Helen made a noise, and shoved Jamie to the ground before ducking low.\\xa0 Something struck the wall with a surprising <em>crack</em>.</p>\\n<p>I stared at the smoke in the middle of the street, at the pouring rain that had to have obscured the view.\\xa0 So far away I hadn\\u2019t even heard the shot.</p>\\n<p><em>The man on the roof.\\xa0 He shot me</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>Ow.\\xa0 Oh man, it was really starting to hurt.</p>\\n<p>I found my feet with their help, I stumbled, and nearly fell again.\\xa0 The two of them had me, almost dragging me.</p>\\n<p>Two of our slowest runners, and me with a bullet in my midsection.\\xa0 The knife wielder was close.\\xa0 We had the alley, and we hopefully had cover.</p>\\n<p>But we were surrounded, with one of them missing, no doubt waiting in the wings.\\xa0 They had no reason not to call the local soldiers in and draw the net closed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you don\\u2019t move faster, gunshot or no, I\\u2019m never speaking to you again,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t have Jamie refusing to speak to me.</p>\\n<p>No way, no how.</p>\\n<p>I did my best.</p>\\n<p><a

The topic was our etiquette and presentation class.\\xa0 It still put me off, having known Helen for a few months, how she could switch from eerie deadpan to animated and normal, demonstrating the very subjects that Gordon was bringing up.\\xa0 The two of us gave her tips, and she demonstrated each of them with an uncanny accuracy, shaping and refining her body language, tone, and overall presentation.</em></p>\\n<p><em>They were as different as night and day, at the fundamental level, human and inhuman, but they had still found a connection.</em></p>\\n<p><em>I realized we had a

murmured to myself, \\u201cIt\\u2019s up to me.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve got to get used to it somehow, make friends with the pain.\\u201d</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nearly fell as the other two urged me through the door.\\xa0 Jamie let go of me to close the door, very softly, and Helen wasn\\u2019t strong enough to hold me up.\\xa0 She did what she could to ease my collapse to the floor.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Pain.\\xa0 I\\u2019d thought I\\u2019d achieved a serious tolerance to it over the years, but the very real imagery suggested a lapse.\\xa0 I\\u2019d nearly passed out, drifting into memories.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Was this what it meant to see my life flashing before my eyes?\\xa0 It was as good a starting point as anything else.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t have many memories of things that came before.\\xa0 Some games with Helen and Gordon, some antics after I broke out of my room, time with Evette and Ashton.\\xa0 Less meaningful things.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou with us, Sy?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYup,\\u201d I said, putting all my effort into sounding casual as I let my head sink back to the floor.\\xa0 I was in a kitchen, I realized.\\xa0 Checkered drapes at the window.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The small pinpoint of pain had spread and expanded until it felt like my stomach was three times the size, filled with agony.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t swollen, though.\\xa0 It was a regular, too-skinny tummy with a hole in it and a lot of blood leaking around it, into my shirt and the top of my pants.\\xa0 I had blood that had dripped around the side of my body and into my butt crack.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This kind of agony was something I was used to, though it limited how I could move and pull my thoughts together.\\xa0 Blood in my butt crack somehow drove the point home better than my life flashing before my eyes.\\xa0 It was a signal that things were horribly, horribly wrong.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">People should never ever have blood in their buttcrack.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey\\u2019re close,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI know,\\u201d Jamie replied.\\xa0 He stared down at me.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m going to find a way to help you, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.\\xa0 I winced as I inhaled and swallowed at the same time and that somehow made the wrong thing move, touching on the area where I\\u2019d been shot.\\xa0 \\u201cWe should go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe should,\\u201d Jamie said, \\u201cBut we need to stop the bleeding, at the very least.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNeed Lillian, but she\\u2019s too far away,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I blinked with more force than was needed, because I didn\\u2019t want to have my eyes close and stay closed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A very deep, male voice cut in, \\u201cWho\\u2019s Lillian, and what the hell are you doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I saw Jamie go limp, his head bowing.\\xa0 Defeat.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen, of course, was Helen.\\xa0 I looked over in the direction she was staring, and I saw a man in the doorway of the kitchen, a wife and child behind him, staring.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I looked back to Helen, and tears were falling down her cheeks.\\xa0 Crying on command.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I met Jamie\\u2019s eyes, then spoke, \\u201cThe Academy\\u2019s attacking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I watched the expression on the man and woman\\u2019s faces.\\xa0 The wide eyes of the child, who was young enough to be of indeterminate gender.\\xa0 The man was young.\\xa0 He\\u2019d probably had the child in or just after his teens.\\xa0 He was like an older Gordon, if Gordon had a weak chin.\\xa0 His expression changed as he wrestled with fear and trying to summon his courage.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He only needed a push.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHelp me,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 My ability to almost take the pain in stride made it more difficult to find the piteous tone I needed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He rushed to my side, twisted around, and told his wife, \\u201cThe kit!\\xa0 It\\u2019s under the sink!\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The woman took the little kid with her as she left.\\xa0 Hopefully to get the \\u2018kit\\u2019.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey attacked in the street,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou heard the gunshots?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The man nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cWe were looking out the window at the other side of the house.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I spoke, wincing as I did, \\u201cThey looked like the resistance members.\\xa0 Black coats, black shirts, those rifles-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cExorcists,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI saw one standing there.\\xa0 His face changed, eyes and nose and mouth and ears going all wonky,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThen he saw that I\\u2019d seen him, he shouted something, a signal, and then he shot me, before he started shooting at the crowd.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Tension lines stood out in the man\\u2019s face and neck.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t move his eyes from the bloody hands that were pressing down on my wound.\\xa0 It damn well hurt, but I could push through the pain, I could find the presence of mind to lie.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Might as well foster paranoia and propaganda while I\\u2019m lying here bleeding</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey looked normal?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYes,\\u201d Helen said, still crying.\\xa0 \\u201cIt scared me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The man didn\\u2019t budge.\\xa0 I could imagine he was processing, trying to grasp the situation, and what the course of action should be.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">His wife came down, with a large kit and no child trailing behind.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what to do,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI do,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>He did?</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I watched as Jamie opened the kit.\\xa0 I could see the label on the lid.\\xa0 It was the sign of some Academy or another, ironically enough.\\xa0 A full kit for medics.\\xa0 Many had been sold to the public after the last war.\\xa0 By the time another war rolled around -this one, as it happened- there would be better kits, with better tools and components.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He moved with a quiet assuredness as he picked through the various things.\\xa0 I watched him, periodically blinking with more force than was necessary, breathing shallow breaths to keep my stomach from hurting.\\xa0 He gathered special pliers and a long syringe with two handles, powders, and metal clamps.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He met my eyes, and there was an awful lot communicated in that look.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Among them was an unspoken agreement.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Had I let slip that he was trying to figure out Latin, after our little trip down to the Dungeons with Sub Rosa, Jamie would have gotten in serious trouble.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This was something else entirely.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNever done this before,\\u201d he murmured.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou said-\\u201d the man of the house started.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMy dad is a doctor,\\u201d Jamie lied.\\xa0 Then he told the truth, saying, \\u201cI\\u2019ve watched and learned.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf you\\u2019re not sure-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m sure,\\u201d Jamie lied, again.\\xa0 He lied for a third time as he said, \\u201cI was talked through procedures worse than this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>You\\u2019ve seen, you remember, you piece it together</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe powder smells different,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCould be old,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie made a face, then tossed the powder.\\xa0 He rifled through the kit until he found a liquid, instead.\\xa0 He set a match on my chest.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUh,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSorry,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cGoing to have to do it like it\\u2019s done on the battlefield.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019ve never seen a battlefield, you butt!\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019ve heard,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t respond to the insult.\\xa0 I realized how scared he was.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The problem with this piecemeal knowledge.\\xa0 He knew the moves he needed to make, but he didn\\u2019t have a foundation.\\xa0 One day, all going according to plan, he could have that foundation.\\xa0 He couldn\\u2019t trust a medicine that smelled different.\\xa0 But that he could even figure out the right tools, that he was <em>this</em> far along, and he\\u2019d kept it a secret?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The Academy couldn\\u2019t know.\\xa0 We were forbidden.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The man moved his hands.\\xa0 Jamie took the scalpel to my injury, opening it up enough for the pliers to go in.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He looked so terrified I couldn\\u2019t bear to look at him.\\xa0 My head dropped to the floor, and I reached out to pat his knee, grunting and gasping now and then as the pliers moved.\\xa0 A small sound escaped my throat as I held my breath.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIsn\\u2019t there something you can give him?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, a moment before Jamie said, \\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBut-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThere!\\u201d I jumped in, and the volume and suddenness with which I\\u2019d spoken made the pain explode through my abdomen.\\xa0 I groaned, long and loud, clenching my fist and squeezing Jamie\\u2019s knee hard, making little sounds with every pant.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cEasy,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She gave my forehead a pat, and pushed hair out of my eyes.\\xa0 It was sweaty, and stayed out of the way.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cTalk to me,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not good enough to find it on my own.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The man spoke up, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t possibly-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cClose,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, other direction.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI feel it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He found it, he got a grip on it, locked the pliers\\u2019 grip, and he pulled the modified pliers free, a bullet the size of a grape held in the prongs.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I wasn\\u2019t privy to the particulars of the clean up job, but he dumped the contents of the bottle in, daubed it around with a swab to get the parts the match couldn\\u2019t reach, then seared the bleedy bits with the match.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNow I\\u2019m hungry,\\u201d I murmured, as I smelled the seared flesh.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBut we just ate,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe had treats!\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI was joking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She gave me a disapproving look.\\xa0 The tears had dried up, and she was smiling a little.\\xa0 All an act, of course.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He glued me together and closed me up, using the clamps to hold things in place until the glue could set.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m not sure how much blood you\\u2019ve already lost,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s no <em>aqua nucifera</em>, and I wouldn\\u2019t trust it if there was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDon\\u2019t move too quickly,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be weak.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cLike that\\u2019s anything new,\\u2019 I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He put the tools aside, leaving a bit of a mess.\\xa0 The man looked a little concerned, as if things didn\\u2019t add up, but he couldn\\u2019t put his finger on it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen gave me a hand in getting to my feet.\\xa0 The man and Jamie moved to the kitchen sink to wash their hands.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I still had blood in my butt crack.\\xa0 I probably looked like a wreck.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThere haven\\u2019t been more gunshots,\\u201d the man observed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThere was one with a knife,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne with claws, and one with some weapon on a chain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cA censer,\\u201d Jamie said, looking over at me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I gestured for him to ease up a bit.\\xa0 I saw him nod.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Riding a high.\\xa0 He did what he wasn\\u2019t supposed to do, he even succeeded and saved me, hopefully.\\xa0 </em>Whatever special kind of person Jamie might\\u2019ve been, he was still a person.\\xa0 He got a rush of adrenaline from a success like that.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It didn\\u2019t show that much, though.\\xa0 Jamie was quiet and reserved at the best of times.\\xa0 He cleaned himself up, leaving his sleeves still rolled up, and grabbed his bag.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI should go,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 He turned to his wife.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we\\u2019re under attack, I need to do something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey attacked a <em>child</em>,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we\\u2019d been out instead of here with Edmund-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded, spooked.</p>\\n<p>I let the drama play out while I gently prodded my stomach.\\xa0 I pulled clothing back into place, wincing at the pain, took a cloth from beside the sink and began to wipe at my shirt where it was all bloody.\\xa0 Jamie handed me my jacket, then helped me pull it on.</p>\\n<p>I was well and truly ready to take something for the pain now, now that Jamie didn\\u2019t need help to find his way to the bullet.</p>\\n<p>The man went to a cabinet, and came back with a gun.\\xa0 He took a moment to put it together, checking for various components, most definitely not a person with more than a few hours of practice, and then gave his wife a kiss.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBe healthy,\\u201d he told me, \\u201cThank you for the warning about the attacks.\\xa0 Will you look after my wife?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood man,\\u201d the soldier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir!\\u201d I cut in, before he could head out, gun in hand.\\xa0 He paused, and I told him, \\u201cWarn others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded, then headed out the door.</p>\\n<p>I pointed, and the others nodded.\\xa0 As the wife stepped over to the door to lock it, peering out the window to watch her husband, we headed out the front door.</p>\\n<p>There was nowhere to go but forward and out.\\xa0 The residential road had people gathered in clusters, talking, and we used them for cover, watching.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop,\\u201d Helen said, but it was less the order and more than fact that she grabbed us and hauled us back that stopped us.\\xa0 Breaking our forward momentum.\\xa0 I jerked, and my stomach clenched inadvertently.\\xa0 I bit back a gasp of pain.</p>\\n<p>The <em>crack</em> marked a bullet striking something hard.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t see where.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo!\\u201d\\xa0 I called out, \\u201cGo, go!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We hurried as much as we were able, with me hurting and sucking at everything.\\xa0 An alley offered cover from the gunshots.</p>\\n<p>They had a gunman that could see well enough through the rain to target us.\\xa0 He was sharp enough to notice us just moments after we\\u2019d emerged from the house.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere is he?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know where he was?\\xa0 First shot?\\xa0 The one that hit me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome idea.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd the shot just now?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLess that I know where he was, more\\u2026 I can eliminate possibilities.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEliminate,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 We hurried down the alleyway.\\xa0 There were people there, more clusters.\\xa0 I studied each group, watching for potential trouble.</p>\\n<p>The others had to have heard about the gunshot.\\xa0 They\\u2019d look after Lillian, if Lillian was even in danger.\\xa0 She was well camouflaged.\\xa0 Short of them killing every child in the town of Whitney\\u2026 which wasn\\u2019t impossible\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFuck,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot that,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I knew my voice sounded more tense than it usually did.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re stuck.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been stuck before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to get out, rendezvous with the others.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t do that without stepping into an open area.\\xa0 If we stay put, the other two might track us down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The rain was coming down harder now.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t quite able to hope that it was making life harder on our enemies.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we think about the things that make them stand out,\\u201d I murmured, \\u201cNose, eyes, the guy with the scarf might just be fingers, touch, and the guy Jamie shot is probably ears.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cPast tense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not willing to bet anything,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere might be a fifth, taste, and I\\u2019m going to assume the one Jamie shot is alive until we see him dismantled on some Academy autopsy table.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFive,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are more than five senses,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cBalance, sense of one\\u2019s own physical state\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s possible,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut these buttheads aren\\u2019t even supposed to have three pieces of work this good, let alone four or five.\\xa0 Experienced soldiers, each with custom modifications?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAcademy work,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTraitors,\\u2019 Helen said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.\\xa0 \\u201cThat changes things.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t feel so good about Helen going after one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can do it,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably.\\xa0 And you\\u2019re going to have to,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t feel good about it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 She was holding herself in a way that I was pretty sure was Helen for \\u2018anticipation\\u2019.\\xa0 Her expression was still normal, smiling, but her body was ready for the attack.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s head in Lillian\\u2019s general direction,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIn case the others can\\u2019t cover her.\\xa0 And because it\\u2019s the direction they\\u2019re liable to be going in.\\xa0 We assess the situation, then we go in.\\xa0 If we spot one, we bait.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The two nodded.</p>\\n<p>We moved.</p>\\n<p>Through winding alleys, awareness of our surroundings pitched to a painful degree.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t at my best, and I was focusing my thoughts and my own un-altered senses on every gap, readying myself for an attack at any moment, knowing it was futile even if I was fast enough to react.</p>\\n<p>We paused at a pile of debris, while Jamie turned his attention to figuring out a plan that worked, then went down a side-alley.\\xa0 The street was packed with soldiers.\\xa0 Another side alley was mostly empty, wagons that were usually there now cleared away.\\xa0 No cover to hide behind.</p>\\n<p>As we returned to the four-way intersection, the woman appeared.</p>\\n<p>Helen indicated, and the three of us crawled into a space beneath a house, belly deep in mud.\\xa0 I used one hand to hold Jamie\\u2019s raincoat down over the injury so it wouldn\\u2019t get too dirty.</p>\\n<p>We were as good as caught.\\xa0 She had the ability to smell.</p>\\n<p>I signaled.\\xa0 We collectively abandoned our attempt at staying silent, and crawled for the other side of the space.\\xa0 The floor above us scraped our shoulderblades as the ground rose to meet it.\\xa0 Jamie squirmed out of his backpack.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChildren,\\u201d the woman spoke, from just in front of us.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d circled around.\\xa0 She could do it again, as fast as we could crawl.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou killed Phlegm,\\u201d she called out to us.\\xa0 \\u201cMy brother.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie reacted to the name.\\xa0 He\\u2019d connected two dots.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t seem to have a ready answer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have his belt,\\u201d the woman said.</p>\\n<p><em>The cans of gas.</em></p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/08/13/esprit-de-corpse-5-7/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The only sound was the rain coming down, and the periodic sucking noise of mud as Helen, Jamie or I shifted position.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have the canisters Mr. Phlegm had on his belt,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot my preferred weapon,\\u201d the woman said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut it\\u2019s somehow poetic that Phlegm might get a last laugh.\\xa0 Not that he is the laughing type.\\xa0 Was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She made a noise like she was spitting.</p>\\n<p>Also poetic, all things considered.</p>\\n<p>I swallowed, then spoke.\\xa0 My side was still hurting like nothing else, even after being patched up, and my voice faltered at the start, the strength to get the air past my lips not there when I reached for it.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s your name?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot telling,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cGoodbye.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait!\\u201d I said, raising my voice.\\xa0 My stomach rewarded me by cramping up in new sorts of pain, clutching like a fist around all the hurt.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t use the canister.</p>\\n<p>To my left, Helen crawled forward, not with her arms and legs, but fingers and feet, pushing and pulling herself by painstaking half-inches, periodically reaching up to grab onto the roof and use that to slide herself forward.\\xa0 The lack of speed was balanced by the fact that she was nearly silent.\\xa0 I was right next to her and even I couldn\\u2019t hear her raincoat scrape against small stones and mud.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d been wearing a nice dress for the event.\\xa0 Now it was ruined.\\xa0 What a shame.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe used to be on the same side, didn\\u2019t we?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not the laughing type either, little boy, especially not with Phlegm dead,\\u201d the woman said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re wasting my time if you\\u2019re making jokes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were Academy,\\u201d I said, not because I knew, but because I had no choice but to follow the same track.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t change the subject without her deciding I was stalling and deciding to off us.\\xa0 Or whatever that canister did.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 But that\\u2019s different from what you said before,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I noticed how she was walking.\\xa0 She was lingering more at the places where posts held the house up off the ground, which kept her out of sight and protected her ankles from any further gunshots.</p>\\n<p>Not stupid.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re related,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re family.\\xa0 We\\u2019re experiments, we\\u2019re conn-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She cut me off.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re <em>alone</em>, little boy.\\xa0 Everyone is.\\xa0 The act of being born is a separation, so is dying.\\xa0 For experiments more than anything else.\\xa0 At least <em>they</em> get to have doctors use sterile scissors to snip their connection to their mother, after they\\u2019re squeezed out into the world, covered in blood and landing in shit.\\xa0 <em>Us,</em> we\\u2019re made, or we\\u2019re born like they are and then we\\u2019re reborn on a table or in a vat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s an experience we share, it\\u2019s-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt creates a gulf between us.\\xa0 You can pretend to have some greater connection to the world, but that\\u2019s a child\\u2019s fantasy.\\xa0 We\\u2019re as different from them as a cat is from a dog, <em>at least</em>.\\xa0 Compare a cat to a dog and a dog to a lizard and you\\u2019re not going to find a connection between the cat and the lizard.\\xa0 They\\u2019re a social species, but we\\u2019re all species of one, or of two, or of <em>four</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen, our lizard, crawled forward.\\xa0 She was crawling across from me, now, her body in front of my face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA year and nine days ago, our species of <em>four </em>added one more to our ranks.\\xa0 In the next couple of years, we\\u2019re going to have a sixth.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwelve days,\\u201d Jamie murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cA year and twelve days.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShut up,\\u201d I whispered.\\xa0 Louder, I said,\\xa0 \\u201cListen, I think we\\u2019re similar in how we approach the world.\\xa0 The differences, the focus on the team, even if my idea of what the \\u2018team\\u2019 is happens to be different-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne of my colleagues, you\\u2019ve crossed paths with him, he keeps a tiny black notebook filled with tickmarks, you know.\\xa0 He counts the number of times people try the \\u2018we\\u2019re the same\\u2019 line on him.\\xa0 A different line or phrase or word for every page.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Drat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m betting he has whole pages dedicated to \\u2018please!\\u2019 or \\u2018god, no!\\u2019,\\u201d I remarked.</p>\\n<p>She was silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas I on target?\\u201d I tried.\\xa0 Her being silent and taking time before she offed us was fantastic, but talking and hurrying things along was better than three seconds of silence followed by her deciding to kill us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot quite.\\xa0 You made me think of Phlegm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Double damn and dang-blast it.\\xa0 </em>The thought crossed my mind, but I held the emotion at bay.\\xa0 My focus was on her and on our conversation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlone,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re alone, it\\u2019s by your own choice, your own way of looking at things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m more alone than I was since you killed my partner,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 There was a pause.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m done entertaining you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen was a few feet away.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t picking up speed, even with that announcement.\\xa0 Still the slithering crawl through the mud.\\xa0 She had to be getting it in her mouth, her nose, even with her lips closed, but she was calm, glacially slow, and eerily focused.</p>\\n<p>We had one option.\\xa0 It was one I hated to use.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t afford to take the time to do that,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I heard something snap or crack from the woman\\u2019s direction.\\xa0 My hopes that she\\u2019d been attacked were dashed when she shifted her footing.\\xa0 She was getting something from the belt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn less than an hour, you\\u2019re going to need all of the cans you can get,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cAll of the bullets too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I\\u2019m sorry</em>, <em>Gordon, Mary</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat so?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe reason we went to go pick up our girl here was because we\\u2019re <em>done</em>.\\xa0 The traps are placed, boxes under half the houses in Whitney.\\xa0 Soon, <em>really soon</em>, the things occupying the box are going to wake up.\\xa0 The city falls, and if you\\u2019re here, if your buddies are here, then you get to watch them die, maybe, and then you die alone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAssuming you\\u2019re telling the truth, what\\u2019s in the boxes?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think they started with spiders,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie added, \\u201cBut, like you said, they\\u2019re as comparable to spiders as cats are to dogs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a pause.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook under the house on the other side of the alley,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cChances are pretty good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Between the rain, the distance, and the lack of lighting, I couldn\\u2019t see under the house across the little alley.</p>\\n<p>The chances weren\\u2019t good at all.\\xa0 My heart pounded.</p>\\n<p>Helen crept further.\\xa0 She was about a foot from being able to lunge for the woman\\u2019s ankles.\\xa0 A crocodile in the mud, with styled hair, at least to a point.\\xa0 It was thick with muck after a certain length.</p>\\n<p>The angle of the woman\\u2019s legs changed.\\xa0 She was looking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 Noncommittal.\\xa0 Leaving me in the dark.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThose cans, whatever they are, they\\u2019re bound to be helpful.\\xa0 If you don\\u2019t want to grab your buddies and get out of dodge.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, not at all,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve decided I can spare one of these.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She shifted her stance, and I tensed.</p>\\n<p>Helen reached, lunging.</p>\\n<p>The woman was quick, and Helen was forced to change her target.\\xa0 One of Helen\\u2019s hands reached out for the woman\\u2019s, a metal can already smoking in her pale grip.\\xa0 When the can went airborne, the wrist Helen was reaching for now disappearing, Helen shifter her weight, reaching up and out with her other hand.</p>\\n<p>She slapped the can down, and Jamie lunged, bringing his backpack down on top of the thing.</p>\\n<p>The smoke was still rising.\\xa0 The mud bubbled, and when the bubbles popped, a yellow-green smoke rose.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOut,\\u201d I said, \\u201cOut!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Right into her waiting clutches</em>.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t wholly right, but I wasn\\u2019t wrong either.</p>\\n<p>She was waiting, but she wasn\\u2019t clutching.\\xa0 She\\u2019d covered a lot of ground without her feet being visible as I crawled.\\xa0 Agile.\\xa0 She\\u2019d walked or leaped off of the side of the building, or stepped on the tops of the posts.\\xa0 Now she faced us, the belt held in both hands.\\xa0 She was ready to step around the corner at a moment\\u2019s notice.\\xa0 Still wary of the gun that had downed Phlegm.</p>\\n<p>She raised the belt to her mouth, and she bared her teeth.\\xa0 Muscles stood out in strange places as she bit clean through the thick leather of the belt.\\xa0 She brought her hands together, and flung one end of it at us.\\xa0 Three or four canisters were hooked to it, and all were smoking.\\xa0 She\\u2019d grabbed the keys with one hand and pulled them out as she threw with the other.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t want to know how good <em>Phlegm</em> had been with this crap, if his sister here was this quick on the draw.</p>\\n<p>The belt flew through the air, plumes following it, and it was Helen who stepped forward to catch it.</p>\\n<p>Our Helen tried to throw it back and failed.</p>\\n<p>It took a few seconds, as Helen tried to fling the belt and failed to remove it.\\xa0 I could see it in how her hair moved, the sheen that appeared on her raincoat, scintillating points of light, rainbow hued, like some chemicals made in water, but the droplets were small and clustered together.\\xa0 Whatever it was, it had made the belt and canisters sticky, and was doing the same thing to Helen\\u2019s skin, her hair, and her raincoat.</p>\\n<p>The woman with the belt stared at us, watching as Helen flailed, almost invisible in the midst of the multicolored smoke.\\xa0 Each little canister was something different.</p>\\n<p>Helen made a frustrated sound, stumbling and falling to one knee in the mud.\\xa0 The woman turned and left, disappearing around the corner.</p>\\n<p><em>Helen</em>.</p>\\n<p>I took a step forward.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s hand blocked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have to-\\u201d I started, my tone much more like a child\\u2019s than I normally liked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me what to do,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He was already striding forward.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re too slow like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHer coat,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cPull it over her head.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie was muddy, and he\\u2019d given me his raincoat.\\xa0 He was wearing the white shirt, but it was soaked through.\\xa0 I could see the scars, and I could see his narrow chest expand as he drew in a breath, prior to entering the cloud.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUse the coat to grab the belt,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t see him anymore, and I couldn\\u2019t see her.</p>\\n<p>Jamie would use the coat, he would pull it away-</p>\\n<p>Then what?\\xa0 It would be stuck to him, or stuck to Helen.</p>\\n<p>I turned, looking.\\xa0 The street was empty, people had fled the initial gunshots.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen come to me!\\u201d I called, still searching.\\xa0 \\u201cAs fast as you can!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The umbrella-</p>\\n<p>Jamie had left it behind, while crawling through the mud.</p>\\n<p>Something else.</p>\\n<p>A thin bit of wood framed the bottom of the nearest building, so it didn\\u2019t just end, but had some decorative flair, even if it was a strip of painted wood, an inch and a half across.</p>\\n<p>I braced myself, knowing how much this would suck.</p>\\n<p>Kicking the little strip of wood was painful enough that I nearly forgot what I was doing.\\xa0 My focus was dashed, I very nearly threw up, and only managed to stop with the realization that throwing up would make my stomach hurt <em>more</em>.\\xa0 It was a primal realization, one that reached all the way to my reptile brain, that little bundle of instincts and impulses.\\xa0 Through that mechanism, I managed to keep myself from heaving my meager breakfast and bit of apple onto the muddy span between the two buildings.</p>\\n<p>I found myself staring at the wood, still affixed to the wall.\\xa0 <em>Maybe</em> looser than it had been.</p>\\n<p>I thought of Ashton.\\xa0 I thought of Evette.\\xa0 My promise to Jamie, to guard him while he slept, which I\\u2019d kept up since I\\u2019d met him, and I thought of that horrible calm that had overcome me when I\\u2019d been in Sub Rosa\\u2019s clutches.</p>\\n<p>Calm, away from the noise, away from the expectations and the people and the demands.</p>\\n<p>It was, much as the sniffing woman had said, a very <em>alone</em> sort of calm.</p>\\n<p>I made myself kick again.</p>\\n<p>The agony in my middle was worse, but somehow I found it easier to deal with.</p>\\n<p>Pain punctuated my existence.\\xa0 I threw myself into danger.\\xa0 I got hurt for the others.\\xa0 I had pain inflicted on my body and mind on a rote schedule, with checkmarks on paper and doctor\\u2019s signatures.</p>\\n<p>Pain was only pain.\\xa0 Pain meant I was alive.</p>\\n<p>Another kick.\\xa0 This time something came free.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was stumbling toward me.\\xa0 Apparently blind, his skin raw and bleeding, clothes crumpled and stiff, he had the bundle of raincoat, which was still billowing with gas.</p>\\n<p>I grabbed the strip of wood and heaved.\\xa0 I landed on my ass, but with a spear of wood in my hand.\\xa0 Seeing Jamie suffering lit a fire in me, and I found it in me to swing the end of my spear at Jamie and catch the bundle of raincoat and canisters.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t take much doing to knock Jamie to the ground, pushing with the spear as I found my feet.\\xa0 He almost willingly went, as if the strength was gone from him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStand,\\u201d I said, still sounding far too young.\\xa0 No confidence, no bravado.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He struggled, and I gave my all to simply pinning the bundle down, my face and head turned away so my hood might delay the moment when that growing cloud of smoke reached my face.</p>\\n<p>He found his feet, but couldn\\u2019t let go of the bundle.\\xa0 He tugged, pulled, but didn\\u2019t have the strength or the range of movement to break the bond.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBreak free,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve got it pinned down, just- please, Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Again, he tried.\\xa0 Again, he failed.</p>\\n<p>It was Helen who came down the alleyway, stumbling at a running pace, more or less blind by definition herself.\\xa0 She had her arms out to either side, bridging much of the alleyway.\\xa0 She caught Jamie in the crook of one arm, embraced him, tackling him, and tore him away from the bundle.\\xa0 The skin of his hands was left behind, I suspected.</p>\\n<p>The two of them landed dangerously close to the opening of the alley.\\xa0 I thought of the gunman, perched on a building.</p>\\n<p>I heaved my bundle-on-a-stick, only to have my stomach nearly give out.\\xa0 I switched my grip and swung instead of bringing it up.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t too heavy, only unwieldy, and I managed to toss it out into the street, off to one side.</p>\\n<p>The gas continued to billow.\\xa0 I could only hope it would break the man\\u2019s line of sight.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and Helen were mostly blind, though Jamie a little less than Helen, thanks to his glasses, and both of them were blistered and bleeding, though Helen had gotten the better end of the deal, despite far more exposure.\\xa0 Her skin wasn\\u2019t really skin, I supposed.</p>\\n<p>I watched them, saw them lying there, then looked at the cloud of smoke.</p>\\n<p>My stomach was bleeding, I could feel it at my shirtfront.\\xa0 I\\u2019d need more medical care.</p>\\n<p>Still, I went under the building.\\xa0 I checked that the first canister wasn\\u2019t producing any more gas, then collected Jamie\\u2019s bag.</p>\\n<p>His book.\\xa0 It was important.</p>\\n<p>As I crawled forward, pausing before I tried to find the strength to stand, I looked under the house opposite.</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s box wasn\\u2019t there.\\xa0 There was something that might have been a toolbox or a tackle box at the far corner.</p>\\n<p>It had been enough to convince her.\\xa0 She was on her way to warn the others, to make alternate plans.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Mary were going to be upset.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on, you two,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 My voice felt too light and feathery, mingled worry and relief.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can\\u2019t afford to laze around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie pulled his lips open, and the skin bled where the lips had bonded together, the airborne resin or whatever had collected there, as well as on his eyes and in his hair.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re a jackass.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019m a jackass with a gunshot wound.\\xa0 I\\u2019m allowed to be flippant,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut seriously, we can\\u2019t waste time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded.\\xa0 I handed him his bag, which he felt around until he had the shape of it.\\xa0 After he clung it to his chest, I grabbed the straps and hauled.\\xa0 I\\u2019d already re-opened my wound, I couldn\\u2019t make it worse, right?</p>\\n<p>Helen found her feet on her own, one hand on the side of the building.</p>\\n<p>With only the hope that the gas would block the gunman\\u2019s view of us, or that he was busy relocating to another perch, I led the others into the street.\\xa0 Helen could hear the gunshots, the sound apparently traveling faster than the bullets did, but I wasn\\u2019t so lucky.</p>\\n<p>Haggard, hurting, and lost, we made our way to Lillian\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe had an influence on you,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I thought about joking, remarking on the sniffing woman.</p>\\n<p>But Jamie wasn\\u2019t talking about the sniffing woman.\\xa0 Jamie was talking about the ploy I\\u2019d used to try and buy us time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t everyone?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>He made a sound that might have been a laugh, but came out more as a heavier breath.\\xa0 He coughed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou didn\\u2019t breathe that shit in, did you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know <em>you</em> didn\\u2019t,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 I saw her give me a smile, and it was odd to see her actually face the right direction as she did it.\\xa0 Good ears.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne day,\\u201d Helen said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to make a girl very miserable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell we all knew <em>that</em> already,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot sure why you\\u2019re bringing that up now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot you-you,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou two.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at Jamie, a part of me expecting to exchange a shared glance, except he was blind.\\xa0 It sucked a little, driving the situation home.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t give a girl any hope if you can\\u2019t put her before Jamie,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cAs you are right now, I don\\u2019t think you can.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re bleeding in fifty different ways, you\\u2019re blind, and you\\u2019re <em>judging</em> me?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlways,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He laughed a little, then coughed again, harder.\\xa0 \\u201cAlways judging you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t like that cough.</p>\\n<p>Without Jamie\\u2019s eyes, I was left to do all of the looking out on my own, while making sure I was leading them properly, Jamie holding on to the raincoat at one elbow, and Helen holding on to my other forearm.\\xa0 Another chance encounter with any of Phlegm\\u2019s buddies might not go so well.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a good thing I don\\u2019t like girls then,\\u201d I mused, trying to take my mind off of the open wound in my side, the danger, and the others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou do,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight.\\xa0 You know me better than I know myself?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to leave you guys behind if you keep that up.\\xa0 Besides, there aren\\u2019t any girls out there for me.\\xa0 Gordon can do the thing with Shipman, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s Mary,\\u201d Jamie said, quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian isn\\u2019t one of us.\\xa0 Well, she is, but she isn\\u2019t.\\xa0 She-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe what?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t seem fair, or real?\\xa0 Real\\u2019s not the word, but expecting a girl to like me, when I\\u2019m not guaranteed to live that long.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was no response.\\xa0 Jamie and Helen were silent.\\xa0 The rain was washing away the thin trickles of blood where the skin had been eaten away or had blistered and the resin had pulled on the blisters to open them, and diluting the mud, so it slid off in handfuls.\\xa0 Their clothing was being stained, where the mud hadn\\u2019t already caked it and turned it a dark brown-black.</p>\\n<p>I turned around, and moved my elbow accidentally, leading Helen to think I was turning.\\xa0 She stumbled a bit.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t see any buildings through the downpour, now, which I hoped was cause to believe that the gunman couldn\\u2019t see us, over the top of the cloud of smoke.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re too nice a guy, Sy,\\u201d Jamie said, finally.</p>\\n<p>It was dark, wet, and cold, the rain was an outright storm, now, and the clusters of people were hard to make out.\\xa0 Each one we approached had the potential to be a threat.\\xa0 We were far enough away from where the gunshots had been that people weren\\u2019t actively hiding or fleeing, but close enough that they were concerned, huddling, trying to puzzle out the situation.</p>\\n<p>Heads turned.\\xa0 People started to approach.</p>\\n<p>It was more harm than good, potentially.\\xa0 If people crowded around us, the man with the scarf could slip in close, use one of those knives\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay away,\\u201d I said, as they got closer.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t touch them.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t touch me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Then I said the magic word.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDisease.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The word repeated itself through the crowd.</p>\\n<p>The way opened before us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been told where to go,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I kept talking only because we couldn\\u2019t afford questions.\\xa0 \\u201cRebellion members turned on each other, or they\\u2019re Academy plants, or there\\u2019s a parasite, I don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 But Whitney is under attack.\\xa0 Spread the word.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Phobos and Deimos.\\xa0 Fear and Panic.</em></p>\\n<p>Nebulous ideas, nothing certain.</p>\\n<p>But a point that was driven home with a few key words, and the imagery of small children, hurt, bleeding, and impossible to help.</p>\\n<p>Lillian wasn\\u2019t so impossibly far away, but we were moving so slowly.</p>\\n<p>As it turned out, we didn\\u2019t need to get that far.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, Mary, Lillian, and Shipman all appeared, a distance down the street.\\xa0 They picked up speed, approaching.</p>\\n<p>The looks on their faces.\\xa0 It was a fluttery, uncertain expression, much as my voice had been earlier.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been discovered,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey know, they sent assassins, three or four left.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t stay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not done,\\u201d Shipman said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re done,\\u201d I said, my voice low.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d Lillian asked, cutting in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot very, gunshot,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re bad too.\\xa0 They need help.\\xa0 Three gases, from one of the assassins.\\xa0 Glue, don\\u2019t touch them, something flesh-eating, definitely don\\u2019t touch them, and a third.\\xa0 Might be poison.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s coughing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause blood keeps dripping down the back of my throat from my nose,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey need help,\\u201d Lillian agreed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCoach,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere was one-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He stopped, craning his head.\\xa0 \\u201cCome on!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We moved as fast as we were able, but at least I was able to let the others look after Jamie and Helen, while I stumbled along on my lonesome.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was talking to a coach driver.\\xa0 As we approached, the man opened the side door.</p>\\n<p>As a group, we climbed inside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHospital it is,\\u201d the man said, before closing the door.\\xa0 The latch clicked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow do we activate your project?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not,\\u201d Shipman said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s too early.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were supposed to be nearly done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe are,\\u201d the sourpuss told me.\\xa0 \\u201cBut for this to work, we need to reach a certain critical point.\\xa0 We gauged how fast their response time would be, their resources here, the scientists in the area.\\xa0 If we start it too early, they\\u2019ll be able to counteract it before it becomes a real issue.\\xa0 It\\u2019s too early.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe other side of it,\\u201d Gordon said, his voice level, \\u201cIs that we were supposed to signal the Academy, so they could time the activation with an attack.\\xa0 Something clean and simple, while they can\\u2019t put up a fight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMinimum deaths,\\u201d Shipman said.</p>\\n<p>Minimum deaths.\\xa0 She cared about that sort of thing?</p>\\n<p>Surprising.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t expected that to be one of her priorities.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d Jamie murmured.\\xa0 He pulled his lips apart slowly, but there was still tearing and bleeding.\\xa0 Lillian was rummaging in her bag, trying to find things.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re approaching turn toward hospital.\\xa0 Sy\\u2019s right.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t stay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich way is the turn?\\u201d Mary asked, turning to try and look through the front window, which as barely the size of an envelope.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019ll turn right.\\xa0 We want to leave.\\xa0 Turn left.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.\\xa0 She stepped to the side of the coach, opened the door, and swung outside, still holding the handle.\\xa0 The door slammed, Mary clinging to the outside.</p>\\n<p>Three seconds passed.\\xa0 A larger body dropped off the opposite side of the coach.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOuch,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI hope-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The carriage bumped as it rolled over the larger body.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-he\\u2019s okay,\\u201d she said, in a smaller voice.</p>\\n<p>The coach abruptly picked up speed, the horses trotting briskly.\\xa0 Mary turned us to the left.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can still sneak in, leave boxes,\\u201d Shipman said.\\xa0 \\u201cActivate it after.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t have to be in the city.\\xa0 It would help, but we\\u2019ll make do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey <em>know</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know they know because I damn well told them.\\xa0 There\\u2019s no other choice.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll dismantle it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw her expression change.\\xa0 Gordon reached over to put a hand on her knee.</p>\\n<p>Then he opened the same door Mary had.\\xa0 He raised a thin whistle to his mouth, and he blew.</p>\\n<p>A long, high, sweet sound.</p>\\n<p>Ten, twenty, thirty seconds.</p>\\n<p>There was an art to it, almost.\\xa0 Such a convenient activation method.</p>\\n<p>The whistle was picked up elsewhere, mostly behind us, now that we were on the outskirts, heading out.\\xa0 Each box of creatures was capable of mimicking the tone, passing it on, so it swept over the city, a single, sharp tone.</p>\\n<p>I saw the first of the spiders, the size of my fist, but black and bulbous, the center body almost tumorous.\\xa0 I knew it had to be light if Mary had carried whole boxes of them, or it had absorbed ambient moisture, perhaps.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t matter.</p>\\n<p>From under one house, one box, just looking at the nearest wall of the building, I could see dozens of the things.</p>\\n<p>As the rain poured down, the spiders rose <em>up</em>, searching for windows and doors to crawl through.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou owe me, by the by,\\u201d I told Lillian.\\xa0 \\u201cI got you out, in a roundabout way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t count,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes so,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes so,\\u201d Jamie added.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think I\\u2019m going to treat Helen first,\\u201d Lillian commented.\\xa0 \\u201cFine.\\xa0 I owe you one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTechnically, the deal was-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI owe you <em>one</em>, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, turning my attention to look out the window.</p>\\n<p>The little envelope-sized slot slid open.\\xa0 I could hear Mary speak.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere to?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Where to.</em></p>\\n<p>I glanced at Gordon.\\xa0 Different as we were, even with the rift between us, the unanswered questions I had, and his anger over the way his project had ended, I knew we were on the same page.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWestmore,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for them to attack.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded at that.</p>\\n<p>We wouldn\\u2019t be working behind the scenes, this time.\\xa0 This was going to become something else entirely.\\xa0 An environment the Lambs had never faced.</p>\\n<p>A <em>battlefield.</em></p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/08/15/esprit-de-corpse-5-8/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The rain got worse as we got further up the road.\\xa0 It all flowed down toward Whitney, though a cliffside took most of it, which seemed like a pretty good idea from a strategic standpoint.\\xa0 Marching uphill against an entrenched position was one thing, if Whitney wanted to march on Westmore, but an uphill march against an entrenched position, against flowing water ranging from ankle-deep to knee-deep?</p>\\n<p>I was willing to bet it was an accident, but it was a happy one for the Academy\\u2019s side.</p>\\n<p>Sandbags had been piled up on the mountain road, giving clusters of stitched soldiers places to stand and wait.\\xa0 Some were piled in front, to protect against gunfire, while others were piled behind, to divert the flow of water and keep the stitched soldiers drier.</p>\\n<p>Each cluster had one person with it.\\xa0 I imagined the shifts were short, only an hour or three at most, but it had to be miserable.\\xa0 Sitting, waiting, watching.\\xa0 As the only truly intelligent set of eyes, that individual had all of the pressure placed on them, their only company the five or six dead men who stood around them.\\xa0 Those same dead men would smell faintly of the less pleasant human odors, except baked in.\\xa0 The scents of ozone, burned hair, and decay could and would join those.</p>\\n<p>The moisture in the air helped to carry smells to the nostrils.\\xa0 I wondered if the watch was a punishment detail.</p>\\n<p>Poor bastards.</p>\\n<p>One figure at the nearest set of sandbags blew a horn, raising an arm to order us to stop.\\xa0 The coach slowed, then stopped.\\xa0 Two hundred feet separated us.</p>\\n<p>Three figures came down the road, and one of them was stepping very carefully on the wet, sloped path.\\xa0 It was easier to tread where the sandbags broke the water\\u2019s flow, the road was wide, and I doubted there was that much danger.\\xa0 Maybe if someone tripped over their own two feet, or if the spring\\u2019s chill and the damp surroundings had left their toes numb.\\xa0 If and when someone did fall, though, they were likely to keep sliding.\\xa0 There would only be the rocky outcroppings on one side and the steeper drop off the side of the path to the other to interrupt the slide.\\xa0 Neither was fun.</p>\\n<p>The other two figures weren\\u2019t careful at all.\\xa0 They walked with very natural gaits, not so much with confidence as a lack of concern.\\xa0 It made it easy to tell the stitched from the living.</p>\\n<p>Lillian and Shipman had looked after us, more Lillian than Shipman by a considerable measure, but Jamie and Helen were still in unfortunate shape.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s cough had quieted, and the two of them were powdered, to slow the flow of blood.\\xa0 Mary was driving the coach, and the rest of us were within.\\xa0 Gordon and Shipman exited through the one door to step out and get a better view, while Lillian stood in the doorway, standing in such a way that she could look up over the top.\\xa0 I stuck my head out the window on the other side, watching as best as I could.\\xa0 I liked being able to lean rather than stand.\\xa0 My stomach still hurt, Lillian\\u2019s attentions notwithstanding.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHo!\\u201d Gordon called out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d the sole living soldier called out from a distance.\\xa0 He was wearing an Academy uniform.\\xa0 His hooded jacket was red, an academy\\u2019s shield sat on the breast, one I didn\\u2019t recognize, and was backed by the universal Crown, which formed a halo of sorts around the top of the shield.\\xa0 The gap between the crest and the top of the halo had the man\\u2019s rank.\\xa0 A dog\\u2019s head and the roman numerals for three.\\xa0 Spec 3.</p>\\n<p>That was barely above the G-ranks.\\xa0 I\\u2019d seen enough military types here and there to put together the details.\\xa0 Just as another day of hard training in the rain out in the fields was looming, a bigwig would step up and say there was an opportunity for promotion.\\xa0 They would have to miss training, there would be a long stint in classrooms, some lessons, but there would be hot tea provided.\\xa0 A few people on their last legs would jump at the chance.\\xa0 A promotion to \\u2018specialist\\u2019?\\xa0 Getting some training that might help them get their foot in the door when their stint with the Academy\\u2019s forces was done?\\xa0 It sounded good.</p>\\n<p>The G-twos with older brothers and friends among the higher-ups would know better.\\xa0 Sure, the class was fine, there was hot tea, and it was pretty painless.\\xa0 Borderline interesting, even.</p>\\n<p>The problem was that it led to this.\\xa0 Being the \\u2018dog\\u2019 who knew the essentials of how stitched worked and how to fix them, looking after them.\\xa0 Spending time in their company and their company alone.\\xa0 When they weren\\u2019t the human arm and brain of a particular unit of stitched, they were doing drudge work, being among the man who dragged the dead back to camp, or who did the jobs too menial for the proper academy students to do.</p>\\n<p>Most who fell into the trap walked away as changed men.\\xa0 \\u2018Changed men\\u2019 being the nice way of saying they ended up as assholes who resented everything and everyone they interacted with, or they were paranoid of further traps.</p>\\n<p>I watched him draw nearer, and his face was visible, a surly glare, a glowing cigarette propped between his lips, not the first nor the tenth of his watch, I was betting.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe work for the Academy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re reporting in.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve got a badge, issued by Radham-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay right where you are,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>I pulled my head into the coach, looked through the window to see Gordon stepping back, the hand with the badge dropping to his side.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChildren?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re spies.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve got information regarding movements, numbers, people of interest, and events in Whitney.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d the man murmured.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t give a clear response, hemming, hawing, and making noises, as if contemplating.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome of it is time-sensitive,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 His tone was so good, too.\\xa0 Perfect pitch and intonation, authoritative and confident, without sounding arrogant.\\xa0 If he\\u2019d used that same tone with one of those teachers who was just itching to find something to lecture a student about, they would have made a face and moved on to the next student.</p>\\n<p>But the words were the wrong ones.\\xa0 Gordon was good at what he did.\\xa0 People tended to like him.\\xa0 He bent the world to his will.\\xa0 He was the opposite of me; I always fought an uphill battle to get people\\u2019s trust.\\xa0 I had to study them and tailor my approaches to their motivations and weaknesses.</p>\\n<p>I knew that this man we were talking to was making the most out of the very limited power and amusement he could get, here.\\xa0 Gordon had showed the man a kind of weakness.</p>\\n<p><em>We have a need, thus it\\u2019s in your power to make us twist in the wind</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI suppose you want me to let you into Westmore?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s suspicious.\\xa0 People don\\u2019t travel down this road, and a coach of children, no less.\\xa0 Makes me think of the Trojan horse.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat possible danger could we pose?\\u201d Mary asked, without the slightest trace of irony.</p>\\n<p>I let my forehead bang against the frame of the window.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was that?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy comrade.\\xa0 Another spy.\\xa0 We have three wounded inside the coach.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat wounds?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo partially blinded, with burns.\\xa0 One gunshot wound.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve heard stories.\\xa0 A group mingling with refugees, knowingly spreading a plague.\\xa0 People carrying parasites into enemy camps, sometimes inside their bodies.\\xa0 It\\u2019s easier to hide symptoms when you\\u2019re bearing injuries.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI understand that,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you let us talk to your superior-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I banged my head against the door of the coach yet again.</p>\\n<p><em>Make him feel impotent, why don\\u2019t you?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cAhem.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll be able to put those doubts to rest,\\u201d Gordon finished.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr infect a superior officer,\\u201d the Spec-three said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re more than happy to submit to quarantine procedures-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I banged my head for a third time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShut up, Sy!\\u201d Gordon called out, then resumed, \\u201c-if you\\u2019d just let us talk to someone in charge.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll keep a safe distance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man made a sound, then said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll be blunt.\\xa0 Brigadier Ernest Tyler is expecting to hear from us.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve corresponded with him.\\xa0 I know your fellow soldiers have been doing more prep, things are changing around, there\\u2019s an energy in the air, and fear is a part of it.\\xa0 The G-twos know it deep down, even if the people at the top haven\\u2019t said anything.\\xa0 The Brigadier is preparing to mount an attack, he\\u2019s just waiting for the signal.\\xa0 <em>This</em> is the signal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not-\\u201d the man started, then he changed his mind.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s no guarantee.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Weaker footing.</p>\\n<p>Gordon verbally bludgeoned his way through.\\xa0 \\u201cWe were forced to act early.\\xa0 He\\u2019s going to be forced to move before he\\u2019s entirely ready.\\xa0 He won\\u2019t be happy, not with us, not with the situation, and if you happen to be interfering with <em>us</em> and interfering with his situation, that unhappiness is going to land directly at your feet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He let the words hang in the air.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir,\\u201d Gordon belatedly added, with that perfect measure of confidence that was so hard to call him on or slap down.</p>\\n<p>I closed my eyes, forehead resting against the frame of the window, listening.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou go.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll watch this group.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019ll need to come too,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 No doubt indicating Shipman.\\xa0 \\u201cShe knows the more technical details.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll need everyone to debrief, but we can give the Brigadier the immediate particulars.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo,\\u201d the man said, not sounding happy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 This time he said it with a jaunty tone.\\xa0 Rubbing it in.</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t above his moments of childishness.\\xa0 I grinned.</p>\\n<p>I stuck my head out through the window, saw Gordon and Shipman marching the rest of the way up to the front gate of Westmore.\\xa0 I pulled the window down from overhead, with flecks of water splashing inside as the latch clicked.\\xa0 Lillian climbed inside too, the door slamming shut.</p>\\n<p>The coach rocked.\\xa0 A weight on one side, then the other.</p>\\n<p>That would be the Spec-three, taking a seat on the driver\\u2019s bench.\\xa0 Not to take us anywhere, but just to sit.</p>\\n<p>A moment later, <em>my</em> door opened, startling me.\\xa0 Mary climbed inside.</p>\\n<p>She was wearing fairly simple clothes, but she had a habit of dressing up a little.\\xa0 A thin belt with a buckle to draw the waist in, lace-trimmed ribbons in her hair -only one ribbon today-, and lace at the bottom of her dress\\u2019 skirt.\\xa0 I knew she did her own sewing, to supplement what she was given.</p>\\n<p>As a covert agent, having tells was not a good thing.</p>\\n<p>As a <em>girl</em>, the touches defined her.\\xa0 She wore a coat, but it didn\\u2019t protect the lower half of her dress.\\xa0 The fabric clung to her knees and thighs, and only a second layer of fabric hid the outlines of the knives at her upper thigh.\\xa0 At the knee, the parts where the fabric was white and wet were see-through.\\xa0 We\\u2019d been traveling for a stretch, and I suspected she\\u2019d had her hood down for some of it, because her hair was wet, and so were her shoulders.\\xa0 I could see the straps of her underclothing and the tan of her flesh at the shoulders and arms.</p>\\n<p>Raindrops still beaded her throat, parts of her face and the parts of her leg that weren\\u2019t covered by boot or dress.\\xa0 Her knees were white, compared to the rest of her.\\xa0 A lot of time in the market, more indirect sunlight peering through the clouds now and then than any direct sunlight, but it added up.\\xa0 She was oddly prone to tan, either way.</p>\\n<p>She grabbed one portion of her dress, pulling it out to the side and inadvertently showing off more of her legs as she wrung the fabric dry, water spilling out onto the floor of the coach.</p>\\n<p>I looked up, and she was staring at me.\\xa0 She let go of the wrung-out cloth, and it fell roughly into place, still bearing the wrinkles of being twisted in a way that higher quality cloth might not.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d Lillian said, her voice cutting into the stillness.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm hmm?\\u201d\\xa0 Mary turned, dropping onto the bench with a bit of a <em>flounce</em>.\\xa0 Her damp dress did its best to flounce with her, and more or less failed, falling limp around her knees.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe coach-driver?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told him to turn to leave the city.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t want to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe was <em>nice</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe was a member of the uprising,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe gave injured children a ride to the hospital, at no cost to himself,\\u201d Lillian said, sounding genuinely upset at my interjection.\\xa0 She turned back to Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cDid you- did he?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe rode over his knee and ankle,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s alive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian exhaled in audible relief.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou wimp,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian smiled, but she didn\\u2019t argue.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been holding that little nugget of worry in for the entire ride to Westmore.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019ll wish he wasn\\u2019t when Shipman\\u2019s spiders get to him,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>Lillian stared at me in horror.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 Were you pretending that this was all nice and sweet?\\u201d\\xa0 I grinned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s something seriously wrong with you,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a jerk,\\u201d Jamie mumbled.</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.\\xa0 Mary was sitting opposite me, still soaking wet, and there was a definite twinkle in her eye as she met mine.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout the plan.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cNothing we could do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI filled the others in, but you were driving the coach and I wasn\\u2019t up to climbing out to join you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFour or five assassins came after us.\\xa0 We got one.\\xa0 There are still three or four to take into account.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnhanced smell, enhanced eyesight, enhanced touch, I\\u2019m not sure how that works, and enhanced hearing.\\xa0 There might be taste, or another sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeeing those teeth,\\u201d Jamie murmured, his eyes closed, \\u201cMight be wrapping up smell and taste into one sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cI want to meet them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI definitely do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou might get a chance.\\xa0 It depends on whether Gordon sells us up the river and agrees to something like that stupid quarantine measure that came up just now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe didn\\u2019t really expect the Spec dog to take him up on that,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said, \\u201cBut if that man was a little smarter and if he realized what Gordon was doing, then he might just agree, to put Gordon in a tight spot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She began to wring out her hair.\\xa0 Some of the water ran down her arms, and droplets landed on her stomach and on spots which were still dry.\\xa0 The droplets sank into the thin cloth and spread out in widening circles.\\xa0 \\u201cBut he was right.\\xa0 I think he had the right sense of things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\xa0 Probably.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary turned, abrupt.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian.\\xa0 Do you have a comb?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith my belongings, in the back compartment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing in that massive bag of yours?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian shook her head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI use my fingers, most of the time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re such a <em>boy</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie didn\\u2019t react, motionless.\\xa0 I suspected any movement hurt, with his condition.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTry Helen,\\u201d I said, leaning forward to look past Jamie, one hand on my side.\\xa0 Helen was draped over the bench, her head resting at an awkward angle at Jamie\\u2019s thigh.\\xa0 Her blonde hair was still gritty past a certain length, from crawling in the mud.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s sleeping,\\u201d Lillian observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 Someone else might have thought she meant the comb wasn\\u2019t important, but Mary had come to be a part of the team, she\\u2019d shared more rooms with Helen than any of us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s fine,\\u201d I clarified.\\xa0 I moved over, half-draping myself over Jamie to touch Helen.\\xa0 I poked her in the forehead, hard.</p>\\n<p>No moan, no restless shift.\\xa0 Her eyes flicked open, already focused on me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cComb,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She rolled a bit to one side, reaching into a pocket, then raised a hand, holding a very elegant looking comb.\\xa0 She handed it to Lillian as Lillian reached forward, then dropped her arm, eyes flicking shut.</p>\\n<p>Asleep again, just like that.</p>\\n<p>Lillian scooted over, and Mary half-turned so her back was to Lillian.\\xa0 A very automatic process, without any offers or asking.\\xa0 As if it was just assumed that Lillian would do Mary\\u2019s hair.</p>\\n<p>A month or two back, I\\u2019d been at a store and I\\u2019d picked up a little rose-colored book, no thicker than my finger, titled \\u2018stories for girls\\u2019.\\xa0 I\\u2019d paged through it out of sheer curiosity.\\xa0 Not because I had any interest in girls in any special way, but because I\\u2019d been wanting some insight into how girls thought and how they were different.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d been disappointed somehow, and my inability to put my finger on why had annoyed me more than anything.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t even a big or important sort of disappointment.</p>\\n<p>The fact that I\\u2019d remembered that moment while watching Lillian taking care of Mary in the here and now made me feel like I was a little closer to figuring it out, except I hadn\\u2019t and it just made the annoyance well up all over again.</p>\\n<p>I could recall Jamie and Helen nettling me about girls and things, and I could imagine how they\\u2019d very wrongly interpret my line of thinking and felt even more annoyed.</p>\\n<p>I shifted position and punched Jamie in the arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOw!\\xa0 Damn it, Sy!\\xa0 What was that even for?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He grumbled, but he didn\\u2019t have much fight in him.</p>\\n<p>Mary and Lillian were watching me out of the corners of their eye.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d I finally said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cY\\u2019should be,\\u201d he mumbled.</p>\\n<p>There wasn\\u2019t much conversation.\\xa0 Jamie and Helen weren\\u2019t up to much except resting.\\xa0 Mary had her eyes closed, head rocking in time with the strokes of the comb, head periodically jerking when Lillian found a snarl, though she didn\\u2019t seem to mind.</p>\\n<p>I watched them, Lillian asked about the pain, I answered.\\xa0 Mary made some general comments about the runs she\\u2019d done to deposit the boxes of spiders, and that sort of died off as she dropped into an almost meditative state, her hair being brushed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOy!\\u201d Gordon\\u2019s voice was faint, and muffled by the walls of the coach.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd he\\u2019s back,\\u201d Jamie observed.</p>\\n<p>We collectively roused, Helen sitting up, Lillian and Mary shifting position.\\xa0 I opened the door to step outside, flipping my hood up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re in,\\u201d Gordon called out, still too far away to be heard with a normal volume.\\xa0 He closed the rest of the distance, then reached up to hand the Spec-three a note.</p>\\n<p>The others finished climbing out as the man read it over.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d Shipman whispered, tugging on Gordon\\u2019s sleeve.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh,\\u201d the Spec-three made the shushing sound.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you see?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSee what?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh,\\u201d the Spec-3 shushed them again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh!\\u201d Gordon said, louder.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Oh.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I had to step around to Gordon\\u2019s side to see.\\xa0 As I did, the man on the bench of the coach looked up, staring down at us.\\xa0 He\\u2019d refreshed his cigarette since I\\u2019d last had a look at him.</p>\\n<p>He followed our line of sight, down to his pants leg, which was torn, with a trace amount of blood collecting at the base of his boot.\\xa0 His leg jerked, and in that motion, he realized what had <em>really</em> happened.</p>\\n<p>The flesh of his legs had been joined, a ragged strip cut away, attached to the other leg.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 What\\u2019s the- what!?\\u201d he jerked more frantically, cigarette falling to the base of the bench.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t tear it,\\u201d Shipman said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t- careful!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>As the man struggled, one of the spiders from Whitney moved off to one side, away from the flailing legs.\\xa0 Once two legs, they were now functionally one.\\xa0 The Spec-3 saw the thing and twisted, pulling out his gun.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDont!\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll spook the horses!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Even the raising of his voice and the frantic movements of the man on the bench were making them agitated.</p>\\n<p>Shipman circled around the horses, while Mary climbed up beside the man.\\xa0 Before Mary could deal with the spider, he brought both feet up, then slammed them down, partially crushing the thing.</p>\\n<p>Shipman didn\\u2019t seem to mind.\\xa0 She reached out and grabbed it, fingers between individual legs, and flicked it in Gordon\\u2019s general direction with a movement of the wrist.\\xa0 She put her hands on the man\\u2019s shoulders, and Mary put a hand on one knee, and he stopped struggling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay.\\xa0 One of the spiders must have gotten onto the coach,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat the fuck?\\xa0 What the fuck?\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t even feel-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpecialized anaesthetic and very standard coagulants,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt dulls your sense of touch, makes you feel like the limb is asleep, it cuts out partial sections with the incisors and stitches them to adjoining parts with its own silk and its forelimbs.\\xa0 Even if it had a few days with you, it probably wouldn\\u2019t kill you.\\xa0 It\\u2019s just for the psychological effect.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe fuck!?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I think he\\u2019s psychologically affected</em>, I thought to myself.\\xa0 I bit my tongue rather than offering the comment out loud.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll be fine,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very easy fix.\\xa0 They just need to cut the spider\\u2019s sutures and put the skin back where it belongs.\\xa0 There won\\u2019t even be scars.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe fuck,\\u201d the man said, staring down at his bound ankles.\\xa0 Just his ankles, it seemed, now that I was looking closer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think we can get the coach around the sandbag emplacement?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI was eyeballing it, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can scooch by,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ll have to, since our guest here isn\\u2019t mobile.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cYou want to, or should I?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary smiled, putting a hand to one horse\\u2019s neck.\\xa0 It flinched, then relaxed as she gave it a few rubs.\\xa0 \\u201cI can.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The rest of us climbed back in, or partially climbed in.\\xa0 I stayed at the outside, one hand on a bar just beside the door, my foot on the step below.</p>\\n<p>I saw through the window as sourpuss Shipman showed more energy and excitement in two seconds than I\\u2019d seen out of her in the entire time I\\u2019d known her, bouncing in the spot and putting an arm around Gordon.</p>\\n<p><em>It works</em>, she was saying, going by the movements of her lips.</p>\\n<p>My hood flew back as the coach lurched forward, and I didn\\u2019t fix it.\\xa0 Things rocked left and right as the coach scraped the cliff wall to the right and the sandbags to the left.\\xa0 The stitched that hadn\\u2019t accompanied the Spec-three were still standing watch, and their heads turned, dull eyes watching us.</p>\\n<p>Not nearly so well made as Fray\\u2019s Wendy had been.\\xa0 They were intended to do only one thing \\u2013 follow orders.\\xa0 The man who was supposed to give the orders wasn\\u2019t with them.\\xa0 I hoped that Westmore wasn\\u2019t attacked in the time it took a replacement to walk down and join them.</p>\\n<p>Westmore was a city that had been built in wartime.\\xa0 Obvious enough.\\xa0 Walls, gate, defensive emplacements, and buildings that had been made <em>solid</em>, helped by an excess of material from nearby mines in the mountains and hills.\\xa0 Every building had a gutter around it, redirecting the water.\\xa0 Here and there, collections of debris and leaves blocked the way, or enough water had backed up to lift a collection free, and a grouping of brown-black detritus was scurrying along at the base of a building like some decaying, leafy version of a rodent.</p>\\n<p>It was a contrast to Whitney.\\xa0 Where Whitney had been a sprawl, too many people crammed into one space, Westmore was organized.\\xa0 Even at rest, people were in squads.\\xa0 Working, they were in formation.\\xa0 Everyone matched, with only slight variations in facial features, stature, and hair color.</p>\\n<p>The stitched were corralled, in strict rows and columns, their belongings at their feet, guns at their sides, butts on the ground, hands on the barrels.</p>\\n<p>In stitched alone, Westmore had twice as many soldiers as its little sister at the base of the mountains had in regular rank and file.\\xa0 It easily matched Whitney\\u2019s number in human troops, and Whitney\\u2019s soldiers weren\\u2019t, for the most part, even experienced in fighting, as this group looked to be.\\xa0 The ensuing conflict would be the enemy\\u2019s first.</p>\\n<p>Every set of eyes, the stitched included, watched us as we rolled down the main street, past neat stacks and wagon-loads of supplies.</p>\\n<p>On the other side of our vehicle, Gordon was doing the same thing I was.\\xa0 He gave Mary a verbal direction, guiding her to our destination.</p>\\n<p>We passed a barn, and I saw inside.\\xa0 There was something unnatural within, four eyes reflecting light, a deep scar running down its face, horns bigger than I was scraping the floor of the stable.\\xa0 A war-beast.\\xa0 Some Academy student\\u2019s final project for their fourth year of study, probably.\\xa0 His reputation would hinge on how well it did.</p>\\n<p>There were others.\\xa0 Like everything else, the creatures were neatly organized, kept in their own discrete places.\\xa0 Weapons from some of the Academy\\u2019s brightest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you thinking?\\u201d Mary asked me.\\xa0 She sat above me, looking down over her shoulder at me.</p>\\n<p>I could see the Brigadier waiting for us at the end of the street, standing under a set of eaves.\\xa0 An older man, with a beard and no mustache, wearing a uniform without a hood, a stylized helmet on his head.</p>\\n<p>Unlike my feeling from earlier, I could put my finger on this one.\\xa0 Something about the man, and all the little details put together.\\xa0 That prey instinct that had come up in my first interactions with Mary, an awareness that came from countless clues the subconscious registered that the consciousness didn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy does it feel like, if things go on as planned, we\\u2019re going to lose this battle?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcuse me?\\u201d the Spec-three who was on the bench asked, indignant.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Mary answered my question.\\xa0 \\u201cBut it does feel that way, doesn\\u2019t it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/07/30/esprit-de-corpse-5-2/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>I slowed in my run as I saw a man forced to kneel by a pole.\\xa0 His arms were already bound behind his back, his raincoat was open at the front, and there were smears of blood on his shirt.\\xa0 He fought, struggled, and was overpowered by the four men in similar outfits.\\xa0 Not quite uniforms, exactly, but they were close.</p>\\n<p>They lashed him to the pole, cords encircling the space where a crude knotted gag covered his his mouth.\\xa0 The cords were cinched tight enough that skin split, blood seeping out past the gag to touch his chin.</p>\\n<p>Hands behind his back, ankles and head bound to the pole, he was unable to do more than wriggle as a haggard Chinese man approached.\\xa0 One syringe penetrated one side of the throat, another penetrated the other.</p>\\n<p>Blood drained out, other fluids flowed in.\\xa0 The new fluids would reduce the shock to the system when the man died.\\xa0 The blood would be used for other things, if they didn\\u2019t return it to him to make him a stitched.</p>\\n<p>The pole was one among many, all in a row by the outside wall.\\xa0 The ground had once been hard packed earth, but water collecting around and beneath the people who had been bound to the poles had made the base of each pole a mud pit.\\xa0 The mud probably consisted of more things than dirt and water.</p>\\n<p>A minute into being drained to death, the man started convulsing.\\xa0 The violent jerks made the cords bite deeper into the corners of his mouth.</p>\\n<p>A man in a uniform similar to the dying man approached, head bent low so his hood could help protect his pipe.\\xa0 He took shelter under the same awning I was occupying, experimentally puffing before letting himself be at ease.\\xa0 His hood was down, his hair and glorious mustache both wet, small eyes nearly hidden beneath heavy eyebrows.</p>\\n<p>A rifle with a bayonet hung behind his back.\\xa0 I\\u2019d heard people refer to the particular brand of rifles as \\u2018exorcists\\u2019.\\xa0 They were single-shot, heavy, ugly weapons, but they made big holes, they were easy to reload, they were reliable, and they were well made.\\xa0 The name \\u2018exorcist\\u2019 had probably come up because they were supposed to put spirits to rest.\\xa0 Or was it because they were supposed to help the little guys stop the <em>real</em> devils of the battlefields?</p>\\n<p>I watched the convulsions slow.\\xa0 The man seemed at least dimly aware as he raised his eyes to stare through me.</p>\\n<p>The head sagged.\\xa0 The Chinese man noticed, craning his head to look, but kept doing what he was doing, fiddling over at a table.\\xa0 He gave an order to an assistant, who cleared things off the table.</p>\\n<p>If he wasn\\u2019t dead, the man at the pole would be dead soon.\\xa0 Within the hour, he would be up and walking again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t you have somewhere to be?\\u201d the man with the pipe asked me.\\xa0 He gestured the bag that hung at my side.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWaiting for the rain to let up,\\u201d I said, adding a belated, \\u201cSir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt won\\u2019t.\\xa0 <em>Git.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t \\u2018git\\u2019.\\xa0 I watched the dying man rouse, then sag a bit.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat did he do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe didn\\u2019t listen to a superior officer,\\u201d the man with the pipe said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not my superior officer,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t have any.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re on a military base, I\\u2019m militia.\\xa0 You do what I say,\\u201d he told me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d I said, feigning ignorance.\\xa0 Being smaller and appearing younger than I was proved to be a small asset here.\\xa0 I could play dumb.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat did he do, <em>really?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTraitor,\\u201d the man with the pipe said, puffing.\\xa0 \\u201cTried to help the Crown.\\xa0 Stupid bastard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy would he do that?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Crown is <em>bad.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man puffed on his pipe.\\xa0 \\u201cGreed, maybe, or he thought he\\u2019d be on the winning side, whatever happened.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut our side is going to win, isn\\u2019t it?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>Another puff.\\xa0 \\u201cNot about winning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it?\\xa0 I don\\u2019t really understand about what they did to the water, but shouldn\\u2019t we stop them?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t stop something as big as that.\\xa0 People wouldn\\u2019t have it.\\xa0 We do this right, let them know there are consequences, make them change how they do things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The rain continued to pour down.\\xa0 The Chinese man approached the man at the pole, taking a knife to the ropes that bound him.\\xa0 A soldier joined him in hauling the body to the table, each of them holding one of the bags that had been plugged into the man\\u2019s throat, one nearly empty, the other half-filled with blood.</p>\\n<p>It was a better answer to his statement than I could have come up with on my own.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t you have a place to be?\\u201d the man with the pipe sounded annoyed as he addressed me, and his tone suggested he might give me a smack if I didn\\u2019t take the hint.</p>\\n<p>I moved on, pulling my hood down to avoid the worst of the rain.</p>\\n<p>The soldiers didn\\u2019t match, but all of them had exorcists, and the clothing was of the same general style, even if little details differed.\\xa0 I passed one man who wore no coat or jacket, with only an undershirt on.\\xa0 His chest, shoulders, and face were mottled, covered in pustules, and his lower face had a glass mask fit to it, with a tube running off one side, over his shoulder and down to his belt, where he had a small tank in place.\\xa0 His eyes were closed, his face turned upward.</p>\\n<p>I was seeing a lot like him, with increasing frequency, and I hadn\\u2019t gotten any good answers as to what they were or where they came from.\\xa0 People simultaneously avoided them and kept mum when it came to the subject.\\xa0 There were benefits to being young, but there were drawbacks too.</p>\\n<p>My route took me down a side path.\\xa0 The town was a small one, more quaint than anything, but blockades had been erected, there were as many open flames as people could sustain, lighting the surroundings, and every open space that wasn\\u2019t already occupied by buildings was now home to tents, piles of crates, or collections of people.\\xa0 The number of people in this lazy little town had dectupled, easily.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t weathering the extra presence well.\\xa0 Plants were dying, there was trash in the water that flowed along the gutters, and the aroma of the town was of faint human offal and less faint blood, sweat.\\xa0 It was all laced with the smell of the cheap, mass-produced foodstuff that probably wasn\\u2019t fit for proper humans.\\xa0 Starchy, nutrient-packed beans or some such.</p>\\n<p>I found a house with a makeshift fence erected around the front portion, the gate locked.\\xa0 Looking past the fence and into the window suggested a whole gaggle of kids.\\xa0 They ran around and played.\\xa0 Only a few had ventured outside, their raincoats and rainboots on.</p>\\n<p>I approached a girl who stood at the corner of the fence, a flower in her hand.\\xa0 She was picking it to pieces.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t look up as I came to stand beside her, my shoulder touching hers through the fence.\\xa0 A few petals disappeared, drifting down into the water.\\xa0 It looked like the same kind of flower that was growing off of the tree above.\\xa0 A parasitic species, if I remembered right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWorst job yet,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Really?</em>\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWorse than the whole interviewing thing before Sub Rosa?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWorse.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWorse than when we had to deal with the creeping mimis?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe creeping mimis were <em>interesting</em>,\\u201d Lillian told me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey were a pain in the ass, crawling on the walls and ceiling, and the parents were screaming, and then one got the family <em>dog</em>, and\\u2026 <em>ugh</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI liked their design, if nothing else,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd it was my third job with you guys?\\xa0 It has some sentimental value.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cI guess I get that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She huffed out a sigh, and shot me a death-glare that wasn\\u2019t intended for me.\\xa0 It was just Lillian being an unhappy Lillian.\\xa0 \\u201cRescue me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey want you in there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease.\\xa0 I got into an advanced stream and I still know more than the <em>teachers</em>, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s <em>perfect</em>,\\u201d I said, upbeat, just to annoy her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She reached through the bars of the railing to grip me by the front of my coat.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Please.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She used her grip on my coat to shake me.\\xa0 I let my head loll back and forth for a moment.</p>\\n<p>She abruptly hauled me in her direction, and my forehead banged the bars of the railing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOw.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not joking, Sy.\\xa0 Please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what you want me to do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStart something.\\xa0 Set the town on fire.\\xa0 Spread a plague.\\xa0 Murder somebody important.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShhh,\\u201d I said, \\u201cKeep your voice down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe teacher had to look in the books to remember how the second ratio worked, Sy,\\u201d she said, almost moaning.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease, please.\\xa0 Rescue me, and I\\u2019ll do whatever your twisted little mind can conceive of.\\xa0 I will be in your debt, and you can lord it over me for as long as you know me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re getting better at negotiating.\\xa0 That\\u2019s tempting.\\xa0 But no.\\xa0 The job comes first.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her forehead banged the bars just above mine.</p>\\n<p>She remained like that, her eyes scanning the surroundings, then surreptitiously reached into her jacket and withdrew an envelope.</p>\\n<p>I checked behind her.\\xa0 \\u201cThe kids in the window are watching.\\xa0 They can\\u2019t see the paper, but they\\u2019re watching\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey saw you come before.\\xa0 They think you\\u2019re here because you <em>like</em> me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I scoffed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLaugh all you want,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have to kiss me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 No I don\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t sate their curiosity, it\\u2019s going to run wild, they\\u2019ll start talking.\\xa0 Teachers hear talk, and they\\u2019re ridiculously overprotective of the outdated books and half-complete knowledge they\\u2019ve put together there.\\xa0 Give our audience what we want, and they\\u2019ll stop wondering.\\xa0 I can take a little bit of teasing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEw,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I started to back up, but she had a grip on my jacket, still, and she was stronger than I was.\\xa0 Enough that it mattered.</p>\\n<p><em>That</em> was an unhappy realization.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 Ew.\\xa0 Suck it up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think you should suck anything up while kissing.\\xa0 I mean, you can, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She gave me a look, a \\u2018get serious\\u2019 one.</p>\\n<p>I gripped the bars, and then my face as far as it would go between them, giving her a peck on the lips.\\xa0 She tightened her grip on my collar, holding me there, turning it from a peck to something else.</p>\\n<p>She let go, leaving me to stumble back.</p>\\n<p>The hoots and cheers from within the building reached a volume we could hear outside.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was pink in the face as she glared at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHappy?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said, sounding anything but.\\xa0 She hadn\\u2019t dropped the glare.\\xa0 \\u201cEverything\\u2019s in the note.\\xa0 How far along the students are, the quality of the teaching, the texts, my observations of other projects I\\u2019ve seen around town, not that they let us out of here that often\\u2026\\xa0 Keeping us out of the way, they say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot it.\\xa0 Will pass it on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRescue me,\\u201d she ordered.\\xa0 \\u201cEvery time you come, now, you\\u2019re going to have to steal a kiss.\\xa0 Until this is over with.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was my first kiss, you know,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t budge an inch.\\xa0 She was trying so hard not to convey a tell that she gave me one.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can see why people like it,\\u201d I said, to needle her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShut up,\\u201d she said, with venom, face going pinker.\\xa0 \\u201cGet me out of here.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t care how.\\xa0 But don\\u2019t leave me here.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t take another week.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you gave me so much fuel for teasing you,\\u201d I said, grinning ear to ear.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can look forward to the next time you see me, when you con me into kissing you again, over and over-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo get caught and die,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr, or!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could tell the others.\\xa0 \\u2018Oh, did you know, Lillian apparently gets lonely for the company of boys when she\\u2019s bored.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did it for the sake of the job,\\u201d she said, voice firm.\\xa0 \\u201cThe kids were already speculating it was something romantic, it was the easiest route.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe moment your face turns <em>that</em> pink when I mention it in front of the others, they\\u2019ll see right through-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She raised her hand between us, a gesture.</p>\\n<p><em>Incoming.</em></p>\\n<p>I shut my mouth, brain switching gears.\\xa0 She flicked her eyes to the right, and I turned, as casually as possible, looking.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t see anyone.\\xa0 I turned a few times, searching for possible threats.</p>\\n<p>When I turned back, Lillian was fleeing back to the improvised schoolhouse.\\xa0 The gesture she gave me as she stalked off was anything but a secret one.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not allowed!\\u201d I called after her.</p>\\n<p>The finger remained raised as she hauled the front door open with one hand and closed it firmly behind her.</p>\\n<p>I grinned.</p>\\n<p>It was a short distance from the schoolhouse to the main street, and I arrived with much of the midday traffic.\\xa0 Carts were being checked thoroughly by squads and sniffer dogs, and the barking was incessant.</p>\\n<p>My eyes roved over the carts, looking over the people\\u2026</p>\\n<p>Nothing.\\xa0 Gordon wasn\\u2019t here yet.</p>\\n<p>I picked up my pace to get out of the way of a regular old horse that was pulling a cart, reached the other side of the street and inadvertently chose a path that saw rain pouring off in curtains off a tent-top.\\xa0 I squinted as the water spattered me.</p>\\n<p>I heard a whistle, and I saw Mary with Gladys Shipman, standing under a tent, with a counter and register in front of them, unpacked crates arranged around them.\\xa0 A heavyset man was lifting crates down from the bed of a wagon with a stitched helper.\\xa0 Mary whipped an apple at my head, and I caught it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s late,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She looked more concerned than Shipman did.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat happens.\\xa0 Lots of rain.\\xa0 Wagons get stuck in mud.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo mud between here and there,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll see about swinging back this way,\\u201d I said, flashing her a smile before I took a bite out of the apple.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look like you\\u2019re having a merry time,\\u201d Shipman said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian kissed me,\\u201d I said, grinning.\\xa0 \\u201cWell, she told me to kiss her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s eyebrows went up.\\xa0 Her expression was interesting.\\xa0 More curious than anything.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s <em>really</em> bored, apparently,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNah.\\xa0 We had to, the other kids were starting to get curious about her and me meeting up.\\xa0 Might as well, you know?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded at that, eyebrows going down.\\xa0 \\u201cIs she okay?\\xa0 Other than being bored?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s worried about the teachers,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWatchful eye and all that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen I last saw her, she had a lot of names for them.\\xa0 Watchful wasn\\u2019t one of those names.\\xa0 Bumbling, incompetent, depressing\\u2026\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt would be ironic if-\\u201d I started, I stopped as footsteps splashed behind me.\\xa0 In a low voice, I finished, \\u201cIf those buffoons were the undoing of us all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot funny,\\u201d Shipman said, terse.</p>\\n<p><em>Such a sourpuss.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI gotta get going, or people are going to wonder,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Then I reminded her, \\u201cI\\u2019ll swing back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The two of them nodded.</p>\\n<p>My path zig-zagged between buildings.\\xa0 Someone larger might have had trouble, given how little space there was at times, and someone less nimble might have struggled with the crates and other supplies that were piled up in the spaces, protected by the overhanging roofs, but I was perfectly suited.</p>\\n<p>The moment I was out of sight of people, I pulled on the stem of the apple.\\xa0 It popped out like a cork, and I stuck a finger into the tight hole where the core had been removed.\\xa0 When I withdrew it, there was a roll of paper around my fingertip.\\xa0 I unrolled it.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">Boxes beneath 16 houses. \\u2013 M</p>\\n<p>Up from nine, yesterday.</p>\\n<p>Gladys\\u2019 note was very similar to what Lillian was providing, but she had eyes on the market.\\xa0 Her handwriting was meticulous, legible even when written at a quarter the scale I could have managed.\\xa0 She packed a great deal of information about her observations about the town\\u2019s grasp of Academy tech onto a single slip of paper, with a fair bit of shorthand.\\xa0 The backside of the paper discussed the contents of the boxes in brief.\\xa0 Good health on arrival, high toxicity, slightly dehydrated.\\xa0 One box sealed too tight, contents D.O.A.</p>\\n<p>I made a mental note, then replaced the papers, folding Lillian\\u2019s envelope in half before coiling it up and slipping it inside.\\xa0 I popped the cork back in place.</p>\\n<p>I could hold on to the apple for a little while longer.</p>\\n<p>As I exited the space between two buildings, I saw a trio of men, their skin pocked and scarred, boils here and there.\\xa0 Unlike the one I\\u2019d seen earlier, they didn\\u2019t have masks.\\xa0 They looked like plague victims, but each was eerily calm, the expressions on their faces severe.\\xa0 Each wore the same uniforms as the men I\\u2019d seen earlier, and each carried an exorcist and a handgun.</p>\\n<p>They didn\\u2019t talk, and simply watched as I walked by.</p>\\n<p>I hated not knowing things.</p>\\n<p>The city hall.</p>\\n<p>I approached the door, lifting the apple to my mouth to bite into it, like a pig on the dinner table, before raising my hands over my head.</p>\\n<p>The guard at the door bent down low, patting me down.\\xa0 He took the satchel-bag from me, then opened it.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t miss the slight puff of air from within.</p>\\n<p>He went through every piece of paper within, one after another, meticulous.</p>\\n<p>Wordless, he returned the bag to me, and I hurried inside, raising a hand to the apple to leverage it and tear off another big bite.</p>\\n<p>The entrance was a big hallway, and where it might normally have made for a nice view and perhaps a place for the mayor to give a speech, it was now crowded, a makeshift war room.\\xa0 Tables with maps, soldiers, mobile fences erected around boxes of weapons, and three different experiments were all present, each one leashed out of the way.</p>\\n<p>I moved throughout the room, grabbing envelopes from the satchel and delivering them to the right people.</p>\\n<p>Every single one of them paid very close attention to the wax seals.\\xa0 I already knew the reasons.\\xa0 The wax responded to oxygen.\\xa0 I was given sealed satchels, and from the moment the bag was opened, which was supposed to be at the front door, microbes on or in the wax started reacting to the air, altering in color.</p>\\n<p>One soldier, a captain, used a knife to remove the seal.\\xa0 I noticed how he put it off to one side on his desk.\\xa0 He\\u2019d watch the color change over time, just to make sure it wasn\\u2019t a false one.</p>\\n<p>It would be a big win if I could snatch that up, supplying it to the Academy\\u2019s people so they could figure it out and produce something equivalent, but I didn\\u2019t dare take the risk.\\xa0 I had a cushy gig.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou, boy,\\u201d one man said.</p>\\n<p>I stopped in my tracks.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re done.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t come back tomorrow, you hear?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I blinked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNew person in charge.\\xa0 Says no children.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut\\u2026\\u201d I said.\\xa0 There were a lot of clever things I could have said, biting retorts, making excuses, asking questions.\\xa0 But in terms of being a bewildered kid, staying silent was the best option.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll get paid, don\\u2019t worry,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded, but I wasn\\u2019t happy and I let the emotion show on my face.\\xa0 I headed up the short set of stairs to the Mayor\\u2019s office.\\xa0 A double set of doors, ornate.\\xa0 Academy-provided wood.\\xa0 Amusing, given the general lean of this place.\\xa0 This town was one holdout in the rebellion against the crown.</p>\\n<p>When the doors were shut, I knocked, a set pattern.</p>\\n<p>Jamie emerged from another room, a book in hand.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t his notebook.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI just got told I couldn\\u2019t come back,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI heard when the order first came in.\\xa0 New person in town, and a lot of the leaders are listening to her.\\xa0 She handed out something or other, and told them to find strays, dose them, and release them again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCountermeasure against Whelps?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe might know about us, then,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe way things are going, this might be our last undercover job,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Lambs are a known element.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSucks, but there\\u2019s no getting around it,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cHayle brought up an idea of how to use it, still preliminary.\\xa0 Propaganda.\\xa0 I already have notes, they\\u2019ll give me a writer to ensure it\\u2019s readable, though I always was good with a pen and paper.\\xa0 We release a more palatable version of the Lambs\\u2019 previous files, win over the public.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I scowled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI sort of like the idea.\\xa0 But maybe that\\u2019s because I don\\u2019t get many chances to show off, compared to the rest of you,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>He put his book down.\\xa0 I angled my head to get a look at the cover.\\xa0 \\u201cLocal herbs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBy the mayor\\u2019s uncle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you really need information on the Mayor?\\xa0 He\\u2019s a non-entity.\\xa0 Ames is in charge.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m picking up everything I can.\\xa0 All I can do here is manage Ames and read.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLonely?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore than a little,\\u201d he admitted, half-sitting on the desk, one leg down, toe just barely touching the floor.</p>\\n<p>I hopped up next to him, roughly the same position, and my legs didn\\u2019t reach the ground.\\xa0 He leaned over to bump my shoulder with his, and I did the same to him.</p>\\n<p>I thought about telling him about my earlier meeting with Lillian, then decided against it.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t exactly sure why.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFourteen boxes, under the houses,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFourteen?\\u201d Jamie asked, giving me a curious look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething like that,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I removed the cork from the apple and dug out the notes.\\xa0 I smoothed them out on my knee, my foot braced against the front of the heavy wooden desk.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSixteen,\\u201d Jamie said, \\u201cYeah, that fits.\\xa0 I was wondering if Mary got hurt or if she almost got caught.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t have the nerves to do that,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cEvery night?\\xa0 One mistake getting you caught?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you know if we\\u2019re close?\\xa0 Lillian is getting a little stir-crazy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re close,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you don\\u2019t have a reason to be running around, and if they\\u2019re being wary of kids, then the others are going to come under some scrutiny at some point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhile you\\u2019re at it, tell the others that the new leader of this particular branch of the rebellion hired people.\\xa0 Mercenaries.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cShow me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie hopped down from the desk.\\xa0 I followed.</p>\\n<p>He led me through and around, to a separate room.\\xa0 There were stacks of books by an armchair.\\xa0 He found his notebook, opened it, flipped to the right page, and then handed it to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSecondhand,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI grilled Ames as best as I could, even used some of the retention techniques I was taught, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>But it was still damn good.\\xa0 Not that Jamie could really grasp that.\\xa0 He was a perfectionist in many of the same ways Mary was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe arrived, and immediately started laying down the law,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo kids was, hm, the fifth or sixth thing she mentioned.\\xa0 She\\u2019s expecting trouble.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRightly so.\\xa0 We beat her here, though.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd the mercenaries were on the tail end of that,\\u201d I said, \\u201cBefore she moved on to a new topic, restructuring things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt could be attached to that idea.\\xa0 Bring in mercenaries, change who\\u2019s in charge\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy would she want to do that, unless she wanted to make enemies?\\xa0 It\\u2019d be unconscious,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMercenaries are a countermeasure as much as the \\u2018no kids\\u2019 rule and the poison she\\u2019s leaving for the whelps.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m in a bad position until I can find a job,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t figure Ames can find a role for me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s on thin ice already.\\xa0 He lost an important battle before coming here.\\xa0 Got ahead of the news of his failure, got established, but now the new leader is here and it\\u2019s catching up with him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre <em>you</em> okay, then?\\xa0 Is Helen?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked.\\xa0 We\\u2019d managed to \\u2018convince\\u2019 General Ames to give Jamie shelter and a spot to eavesdrop from, with full access to everything that passed Ames\\u2019 desk, but it looked like that setup was starting to wear thin.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m okay.\\xa0 She\\u2019s not kicking him out, and he still has a command-\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>A trump card we can only use once, before they remove him from service.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201c-and she\\u2019s set up elsewhere.\\xa0 She doesn\\u2019t want to interfere with the military types.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I thought about that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere is she?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe theater.\\xa0 There\\u2019s an event going on right this moment.\\xa0 A luncheon.\\xa0 Everyone\\u2019s invited, and it lets her meet and greet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen\\u2019s there?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith Ames.\\xa0 You\\u2019re going, aren\\u2019t you?\\xa0 You\\u2019re spying on her?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m coming with,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I read one more book, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll be able to read for a year after this job is done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I offered him a mock gasp.\\xa0 He jabbed me in the stomach.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWorst case scenario, you\\u2019re too slow, we get caught, we fuck everything up, and we start a war,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot so bad.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot so bad?\\u201d he asked, pulling on a raincoat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I give Lillian an excuse to leave her position, I get to lord it over her forever.\\xa0 She said so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, uh huh,\\u201d he said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cWindow?\\xa0 It\\u2019s not exactly common knowledge I\\u2019m here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWindow,\\u201d I agreed.</p>\\n<p>The banter and jokes continued as we made our exit.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/08/01/esprit-de-corpse-5-3/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Even on the best of days, Jamie was something of an odd bird.\\xa0 The glasses, the book he carted around with him, and the longer, dirty-blond hair, currently tied back into a sailor\\u2019s ponytail, they added up to a strange picture.\\xa0 He had a way of looking uncomfortable in any clothes he wore, as if they were someone else\\u2019s and he was just borrowing them.\\xa0 He tended to be quieter than the others, with Helen excepted in most situations.\\xa0 He was probably the worst of us when it came to a fight, myself excepted, and the slowest of us to react when it came to a non-fight crisis.</p>\\n<p>With all those things put together, he should have and could have been a shadow of a person, the low man on the totem pole, the gawky, awkward one, the bookworm.\\xa0 But he walked and spoke with confidence.\\xa0 His book was inside a waterproof backpack, slung over one shoulder, and he spoke without looking at me, eyes roving over the surroundings.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d spent five hours in this town for every hour Jamie had, but he was the one who knew his way around.\\xa0 He led the way to the theater, and we took the main roads.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t wait until it gets warmer,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt won\\u2019t,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know that for sure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPretty sure.\\xa0 I read the farmer\\u2019s almanac.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course you did.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He pointed at the mountains that overlooked the town, one mountain on each side, with more beyond.\\xa0 The town had been planted in the valley between the two.\\xa0 \\u201cCold air sweeps down the sides of the mountains.\\xa0 Constant wind, which is probably why we\\u2019re getting the constant rain from the direction of Westmore.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere the Academy is making its usual rainclouds.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, bully for us, then,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBully for us,\\u201d Jamie said, smiling a little.\\xa0 The smile faded, \\u201cUntil they figure out we\\u2019re getting rained on and lace the clouds with something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I startled a little at that.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re joking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie smiled again.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\xa0 If they could have, they would have.\\xa0 The rain is too diluted, this far away, and after what Fray did, <em>everyone</em> is being careful about the water supply.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I hit him in the arm.\\xa0 \\u201cJerk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre your punches getting <em>weaker</em>?\\u201d he teased me.</p>\\n<p>I hit him in the arm again, this time with more force.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGuess not,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>Whitney was an important location on a few fronts.\\xa0 The location was the first one, and one so obvious that it was known to anyone who had looked at a map of the area.\\xa0 It sat in a mountain pass, and it remained the closest location to Westmore that the Academy didn\\u2019t have control over.\\xa0 Even for the Academy, it wasn\\u2019t cost effective to push through an area with limited mobility, ground too hard to dig trenches in.</p>\\n<p>The Academy had been divided on how important the little town of Whitney was.\\xa0 Hayle had been among the contingent that had believed Whitney held value, and had volunteered us.</p>\\n<p>The actual information gathering had proven dull, for some more than others, but it had been enjoyable if only for the fact that we were in constant danger, every action potentially outing us and setting the entire town against us.</p>\\n<p>It marked, perhaps, the first job where we\\u2019d been let off our leashes and told to do as we saw fit.\\xa0 Gordon had asked for Shipman, and he\\u2019d gotten her.\\xa0 Mary, Gordon, and Shipman had discussed the need for a discreet weapon they might be able to use to cripple the town of Whitney, and regular shipments had been arranged for just that.</p>\\n<p>It was a shocking amount of leeway, but the fact that the Academy was barely paying attention to us was tempered by the fact that, well, they were were barely paying attention to us.\\xa0 If things turned sour, we were more or less on our own.</p>\\n<p>I noted the presence of more of the scarred, pocked men.\\xa0 A group of five.\\xa0 They all wore the informal military clothing we were seeing everywhere, and they all carried exorcists.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThem,\\u201d I said, alerting Jamie before the men could disappear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe men with the boils?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you know?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>Jamie shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cI was going to ask you.\\xa0 I saw one with worms under his skin.\\xa0 I could see them moving by the way the bumps and ridges appeared and disappeared.\\xa0 One of those we just saw had them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI asked Lillian the other day, she promised she\\u2019d tell me if something came up,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe didn\\u2019t bring it up this time, and I forgot to ask.\\xa0 Mary, Gordon, and Shipman don\\u2019t seem to know either.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m as in the dark as you are,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeing in the dark sucks,\\u201d I replied.\\xa0 I lowered my voice, \\u201cEspecially when we\\u2019re pulling something, and an unknown factor could throw everything out of sync.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded, but he didn\\u2019t have anything to offer me.\\xa0 We <em>were</em> at a disadvantage in that sense, and until we found out what we needed to find out, that would remain the case.</p>\\n<p>The pair of us reached the market, and I saw that Gordon was sitting on the end of the wagon, sitting far enough back that only his knees and calves were getting wet.\\xa0 The man who was working with Mary and Shipman was doing the heavy lifting, when it was really supposed to be Gordon\\u2019s job.</p>\\n<p>I caught his eye, waving briefly.\\xa0 He raised a hand in a halfhearted wave.</p>\\n<p>It was out of character for him, and it had nothing to do with the small rift that had formed after our last encounter with Fray.\\xa0 He\\u2019d been okay since, not quite acting normal, but at least he\\u2019d been putting on a brave face.</p>\\n<p>He said something to Shipman, noticed I was still looking, and craned his head to look at Jamie and I.</p>\\n<p>I offered him a one shoulder shrug, hand raised.</p>\\n<p>He waved his hand a little, fingers horizontal to the ground.</p>\\n<p>It was a gesture that meant\\xa0<em>fine, neutral,</em> or <em>no problem.\\xa0 </em>The sort of gesture reserved for when there was a sudden noise and we realized it was just a rat or something.</p>\\n<p>Frankly, his body language couldn\\u2019t have been less convincing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on,\\u201d Jamie murmured.</p>\\n<p>There were only so many gestures we could make before people started wondering.\\xa0 I gave them a wave goodbye, and we left them behind.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was <em>that</em> about?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon being down and out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWasn\\u2019t his usual.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo idea, then?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie shook his head.\\xa0 Little droplets of water flew off the bill of his hood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat reminds me.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been meaning to ask, you do a lot of book reading, but how\\u2019s your reading of people going?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPeople?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou remember just about everything.\\xa0 If I say something, can\\u2019t you compare it to everything I\\u2019ve said before and figure out what tone I\\u2019m using and why?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re assuming I know why you were using the tone back then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cContext?\\xa0 You could figure it out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could.\\xa0 I can.\\xa0 I\\u2019m doing that anyway, all the time,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cSometimes I get there.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a lot of things to look through and figure out before I can say for sure, and by the time that happens, things are usually done with or they\\u2019re moving forward, and then I\\u2019m left playing catch-up, and there\\u2019s no time to bring it up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe after I get better at all of this,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t ever feel weird if you want to say something after the conversation\\u2019s moved on, okay?\\xa0 At least with me?\\xa0 I like figuring people out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGreat,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFantastic,\\u201d I added.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAce,\\u201d he said, smiling a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBully.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm, marvelous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSuperb,\\u201d I said, not missing a beat.\\xa0 I was already queuing up some more words.</p>\\n<p>He paused, clearly trying to think of one.</p>\\n<p>I poked him in the side, interrupting his line of thinking.\\xa0 When he didn\\u2019t react, I poked him harder.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I don\\u2019t get a chance to think, then I\\u2019m obviously going to lose,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you do get a chance to think, then <em>I\\u2019m</em> going to lose,\\u201d I retorted.\\xa0 \\u201cGod, we\\u2019re like, the worst two people to play word games with.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMrs. Earles met someone,\\u201d Jamie said, all of a sudden.\\xa0 \\u201cFirst person in a while, since her husband.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I blinked.\\xa0 The woman who ran Lambsbridge.\\xa0 A mother figure, but not a mother.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe changed the words she uses, how she dresses, and I think she\\u2019s worried, she wants a relationship and she doesn\\u2019t want it tied in with us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s acted relieved when we go,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded, showing more animation than his usual.\\xa0 \\u201cSo I\\u2019m not overthinking it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t quite mean bringing stuff up from <em>that</em> far back,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s been half a year since we spent two straight nights in the orphanage.\\xa0 Not that I\\u2019m complaining about you sharing and exploring.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI just brought it up because the little things added up, and I started wondering if she was a double agent, but the pieces didn\\u2019t fit, but I wasn\\u2019t sure they didn\\u2019t fit?\\u201d he made it a question.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cThe pieces don\\u2019t fit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t seem relieved, which was odd.\\xa0 I found myself debating whether he was being very analytical, asking about things he already had the answer to, or if he was more anxious than he was letting on.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you asking just to confirm, or was that bugging you?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 <em>Might as well.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cConfirming,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I threw my arm around him.\\xa0 He reached an arm around me and mussed up my hair, pulling me off balance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou smell like Lillian,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo I?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust a bit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou and that nose of yours,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou could learn to use yours, too.\\xa0 Most underutilized sense.\\xa0 All it takes is a little attention.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure, Jamie,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll teach you, if you teach me about people?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI notice you dodged the question.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a brat,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd this is the theater, coming up.\\xa0 The person running the event is the same person that said \\u2018no children\\u2019.\\xa0 This isn\\u2019t as simple as walking in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs the event catered?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen we go in through the back door and the kitchen,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s bank on her not having told the kitchen staff what she told the others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUhh,\\u201d Jamie said, suddenly sounding like he had doubts.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlay along,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAll you have to do is act like you belong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m regretting coming along.\\xa0 I have trouble looking like I belong when I\\u2019m being <em>Jamie</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNah,\\u201d I said, as we circled around toward the back of the building.\\xa0 \\u201cYou fit in with the rest of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wonder,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you?\\xa0 What do you wonder?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat happens later, where we fit in, how we adapt, the calls we end up making\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVague.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a vague sort of wondering,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you thinking you wanted to go with Fray?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d he said, without a moment\\u2019s pause.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t volunteering, and I didn\\u2019t pry, just like he hadn\\u2019t pried when he\\u2019d realized I\\u2019d been evasive about the topic of Lillian.\\xa0 The reason we could even talk to each other like this was that we had a good sense of each other.\\xa0 We didn\\u2019t have to be on guard, we could experiment and share.</p>\\n<p>I liked that.</p>\\n<p>I saw a man standing outside the back door, a little wrinkled, long hair slicked back with damp, his shirtsleeves rolled up to his elbows, a cigarette in hand.\\xa0 White shirt, black pants.\\xa0 He looked like staff.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat color shirt do you have on?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUnder your jacket.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhite.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith buttons?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFollow my lead.\\xa0 Eyes forward, chin up.\\xa0 You\\u2019re proud to be doing this job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>We approached the man at the back door, and I pulled off my raincoat as soon as I was under the eaves and out of the rain.\\xa0 I draped it over a box to one side.\\xa0 The apple had been devoured and abandoned, the messages left in the inside breast pocket.\\xa0 I withdrew them and held them so Shipman\\u2019s note was the one on top.\\xa0 A little less rumpled \\u2013 it conveyed a better image.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was already removing his raincoat, the backpack sitting on the crate by mine.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs the door locked?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho\\u2019s asking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re supposed to drop off a message and a package,\\u201d I said, holding up the papers.\\xa0 I pulled them away from his reaching fingers as he moved to investigate my claim.\\xa0 \\u201cWe were told to use the back door, because we\\u2019d get seen if we went through the front?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man frowned.\\xa0 He gave us a once-over.\\xa0 Two boys in white button-up shirts and black pants, albeit with boots on.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been wearing the outfit because I\\u2019d been acting out my role as a messenger and young mail deliverer, Jamie had been wearing it because it was his style.</p>\\n<p>We didn\\u2019t look like urchins, and that was the important part.\\xa0 We were boys with a job to be done.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoor\\u2019s unlocked,\\u201d he said, before reaching over and opening it partway.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t seem willing to expend enough effort to move from where he stood, so it was only opened a half-foot.\\xa0 I grabbed it and hauled it open.</p>\\n<p>We entered into a kitchen, the air thick with the smell of smoke and cheeses.\\xa0 Several stoves were going, and it looked like virtually all of the food was being made available in quantities no larger than my fist.\\xa0 Some of it looked expensive \\u2013 including things that looked like seahorses crossed with snails, all soft pronged bits and questionably defined shapes, all tinged in brilliant sunset reds, where they weren\\u2019t white and vaguely translucent.</p>\\n<p><em>Because frog legs, snails and fish eggs got to be too mundane, they had to invent obscure new things to eat.</em></p>\\n<p>I chose a route through the kitchen that would keep us out of the way of the more important members of the kitchen \\u2013 the guy that seemed to be quietly giving instructions to everyone present, the chefs, and a man handing bottles to a well-dressed young lady, possibly a sommelier.</p>\\n<p>The chef\\u2019s assistants and the waiters who were venturing into the kitchen didn\\u2019t say a word, though the young, black men and women gave us curious looks.\\xa0 When people lacked agency or authority, it could be hard for them to call out others on the same.\\xa0 They were cogs in a very organic machine, they had a role, and right now that role was taking up all their focus.\\xa0 Stopping and drawing attention to themselves wasn\\u2019t in the cards.</p>\\n<p>I liked places like this.\\xa0 Places where humans had a system and became eminently predictable.\\xa0 The box didn\\u2019t need to be disturbed.</p>\\n<p>I pointed at a little window which allowed the kitchen a partial view of the room beyond.\\xa0 It was well above our heads, running over a countertop.\\xa0 I stepped up onto a stool, then took a seat on the counter, the window to my right.</p>\\n<p>That seemed to get attention.\\xa0 I watched people glancing at me as they went about their business, all rush, hustle and bustle.\\xa0 Jamie climbed up to sit beside me, and I scooted over to give him a better view.</p>\\n<p>Through the window, we could see the luncheon, though it looked more like a party.\\xa0 There were tables for sitting down at, but there was a band and a singer, and most people were mingling.</p>\\n<p>Something felt <em>off.\\xa0 </em>I glanced over the room to try and figure out what it might be.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou,\\u201d a chef spoke to us.\\xa0 He had a towel around his shoulders, and was dabbing at his forehead with one corner.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were told to come in here and wait,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I tapped Jamie\\u2019s bag.\\xa0 \\u201cParcel for delivery, has to pass from our hands to theirs.\\xa0 If we\\u2019re in your way, please let us know so we can move.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man that had been barking orders was talking to someone, but he was glancing up at us and the chef we were talking to.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy does it have to be here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m just doing what I was told, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He seemed to consider.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t have much excuse to kick us out.</p>\\n<p><em>There\\u2019s always a hierarchy.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a very simple game when you get down to it.\\xa0 </em>Chefs were a trickier bunch than some, I knew.\\xa0 Even Mrs. Earles wasn\\u2019t to be messed with when she was cooking.\\xa0 Chefs were artists in temperament and they worked long enough hours that they lacked any patience.\\xa0 If something was going to go wrong, it could very well be this.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t get underfoot,\\u201d he conceded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t dare,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is your kitchen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He made a face.\\xa0 Subtly, he indicated the man that was giving orders.\\xa0 \\u201cHis kitchen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen why were you the one who came to talk to us?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s busy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr,\\u201d I said, \\u201cyou\\u2019re the one that really runs things here.\\xa0 I know how this sort of thing works, sir.\\xa0 He does too.\\xa0 Without you and the other chefs, there would be nothing.\\xa0 Without him, there\\u2019d be another manager.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think so, huh?\\u201d the chef asked.</p>\\n<p>I nodded somberly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t cause trouble,\\u201d he said, before getting back to work.\\xa0 As the manager looked over in our direction, the chef waved dismissively, a gesture not unlike Gordon\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p><em>Not a problem.\\xa0 Ignore, </em>I thought, filling in the blanks.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I turned to watch through the window.\\xa0 The glass was thick and it wasn\\u2019t smooth, which made for a warped picture.\\xa0 I found a position where I could see through without too much difficulty.\\xa0 Jamie set his chin on my shoulder, his eyes on another such patch.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot like you,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot like me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo be nice.\\xa0 Fluff up someone\\u2019s ego.\\xa0 I know you could have done that differently.\\xa0 You <em>have</em> done things differently.\\xa0 I remember.\\u201d\\xa0 His chin drove into my shoulder a little each time he opened his mouth to make a sound.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou remember me talking about the bug box?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d he said, his chin jabbing my shoulder again.\\xa0 I moved it to force him to reposition.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is a bug box.\\xa0 Except there\\u2019s no shaking needed.\\xa0 They\\u2019re already at each other\\u2019s throats.\\xa0 I guarantee you there\\u2019s more drama in here than in any classroom at Dame Cicely\\u2019s.\\xa0 People are easiest to manipulate when it\\u2019s \\u2018us versus them\\u2019, and in here, it\\u2019s him versus the manager.\\xa0 Which is, hm, the second most important reason I did that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSecond?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSecond.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAm I supposed to guess the first?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 I\\u2019m waiting for the dramatic moment when I get to <em>show</em> the first.\\xa0 We are in a theater, after all.\\xa0 Drama is important.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded, his chin rubbing my shoulder.\\xa0 I moved it again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething\\u2019s really interesting about this scene,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOn a few levels.\\xa0 Awful lot of rich-looking people, for one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhitney used to be a place where the wealthy had their second or third vacation homes.\\xa0 Not for summertime, but for winters.\\xa0 When they needed to get away from the city, they\\u2019d come here, do some hunting or ice fishing.\\xa0 Or hole up in a cabin with a fire, enjoy a little distance from the rest of the world.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEscaping the mess and smells of the city, only to kill something and experience the smell of blood, guts, and their own sweat,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat sounds self-defeating.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s easy to be self-defeating when you have that kind of wealth and power,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cSome of the houses have permanent residents now, but some are still vacation homes.\\xa0 Either way, it\\u2019s a place a lot of people know how to get to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Men in suits and women in dresses, with waiters in simple white shirts and black slacks moving between them, holding trays.\\xa0 The singer on the stage was a black woman with a blue silk wrap around her head and a sleek silk full-length dress.</p>\\n<p>She was good, from what I could make out of her singing.\\xa0 It came in fits and starts, as staff entered and left through the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI spy a Helen,\\u201d Jamie murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd our General Ames.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked, and Jamie pointed a finger, helping me to look in the right direction.\\xa0 Helen was playing her part, the dutiful daughter.\\xa0 Ames looked uncomfortable.\\xa0 A man caught between a rock and a hard place.</p>\\n<p>It was good to know he was still behaving.\\xa0 A large part of what we\\u2019d been working on to this point was ensuring our grip on him wasn\\u2019t going to falter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood for her,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOut of all of us, she\\u2019s probably eating the best.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd she doesn\\u2019t even enjoy food in the same way we do,\\u201d Jamie commented.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s something really sad about that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d I agreed.</p>\\n<p>We watched for another few moments.\\xa0 Approaching footsteps made me turn my head.</p>\\n<p>The chef I\\u2019d talked to earlier was approaching yet again.\\xa0 Wordless, he set down a plate, stacked with appetizers and tiny cakes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWow!\\xa0 Thank you, sir!\\u201d I said, trying to sound surprised.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t respond, only turning to leave.</p>\\n<p>I picked up one of the seahorse-slug things and viciously bit its head off.\\xa0 It tasted like undercooked bacon, but a longer-lasting aftertaste that made the initial texture worth it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re allowed to gloat,\\u201d Jamie whispered to me.\\xa0 \\u201cThis was the first priority, wasn\\u2019t it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have no idea what you\\u2019re talking about,\\u201d I whispered back, smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrat,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 Then, distracted, he turned to the window, \\u201cOh!\\xa0 I recognize that face.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie indicated a man.\\xa0 Even though most of the guests had removed their long coats, this one wore his.\\xa0 He had long hair and glasses, but the hair was black, and the man was old enough to have white-and-black stubble on his cheeks.\\xa0 He walked with his hands clasped in front of him, milling aimlessly until a woman in a deep blue dress approached, catching him in conversation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe man\\u2019s name is Cynthia?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe woman in the dress is Cynthia.\\xa0 She\\u2019s taking charge of the rebellion here, and she\\u2019s the one throwing this little lunch party,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho\\u2019s the man?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLouis Peralta.\\xa0 Ex-New Spaniard, removed from Radham Academy three years ago, he studied the science of <em>pain</em>.\\xa0 How we experience it, how to remove it, how to inflict it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSounds like a lovely chap,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe loveliest.\\xa0 When he walks down the road, children and small woodland creatures flock around him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnyone else?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI can\\u2019t help but notice that there\\u2019s a distinct lack of stitched here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s true.\\xa0 Most are probably off fighting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr there\\u2019s a certain kind of status to being able to hire actual people, instead of using dead ones,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Or</em> they\\u2019re playing up to a certain audience.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re demonizing the Academy, using the Academy\\u2019s tools in the background looks bad.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrue,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cQuestion is,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere <em>are</em> monsters in the audience.\\xa0 Past Helen, the two tall women at the far end there, on either side of the man?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh.\\xa0 He\\u2019s Mr. Pock.\\xa0 Think Ibbott, but he likes to make <em>sets</em>, he\\u2019s only about half as arrogant, and only a third as good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s Edwin Grahl.\\xa0 He was innovating new ways of doing stitched when something political behind the scenes at one of the Academies got him upset.\\xa0 He left in a huff, found a patron, and continued his work.\\xa0 The Academy put out a warrant for unlicensed use of the Academy\\u2019s knowledge.\\xa0 He went into hiding.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are a lot of these guys,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Now that Jamie was pointing them out, I was getting a better sense of things.\\xa0\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t always easy to identify the Academy educated.\\xa0 Sometimes it was, sometimes they had the wild hair or the coats or tools on hand, but more than half of them blended in with the crowd.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJohn Durant.\\xa0 He got removed from the Academy when he helped make a superweapon, but failed to leash it right.\\xa0 People got killed.\\xa0 There are very few people I can think of who are as volatile as he is.\\xa0 Angry, works on projects bigger than he can handle.\\xa0 He could be as dangerous to their side as he might be to ours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA lot of people that left the Academy, one way or another,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot all Academy trained, but close enough to have something to offer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s essentially it,\\u201d Jamie murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s gathering her forces.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The way Cynthia was doing it was interesting, too.\\xa0 I saw how she took the arm of Dr. Peralta and led the man to a group of the high-society types.</p>\\n<p>What was the plan there?\\xa0 Building connections?\\xa0 Convincing the people with the money and the resources that this was a battle that could be won?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cMan with the red tie?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked and saw a man, blond haired, with a jaw prominent enough that it looked like it had been surgically modified.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNobility,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Here?</em>\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 A two-legged cat might have had as much sense to walk into a wolf\\u2019s den.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s illegitimate.\\xa0 Of everyone here that might hate the Crown and the people that fall under its umbrella, he probably hates the Crown the most.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTall order,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I grabbed a tiny cake.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTall order,\\u201d Jamie agreed.\\xa0 He grabbed a little bacon-and-pastry affair, then offered it to me.\\xa0 On a whim, we touched cake to pastry as if we were toasting a drink.</p>\\n<p>He popped his treat into his mouth.\\xa0 I started, then stopped.</p>\\n<p>Someone had come in the back door.\\xa0 A woman, with thick black hair falling across her eyes, parted so that only her nose and a wide mouth were visible.\\xa0 She wore a military uniform, just as the scarred people and the countless soldiers in Whitney did.</p>\\n<p>A woman in uniform wasn\\u2019t the most unusual thing in the world.\\xa0 But a woman that entered a room and <em>sniffed</em>, rather than looking around?</p>\\n<p>Entering through the back door?</p>\\n<p>With our raincoats clenched in one hand?</p>\\n<p>Her head turned in our direction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo,\\u201d I said, hopping down from the counter, hauling Jamie down with me.\\xa0 He only just managed to collect his backpack before I hauled him along.</p>\\n<p>There weren\\u2019t many escape routes.\\xa0 There was a door to one side, which might have led to the kitchen manager\\u2019s office, but I wasn\\u2019t willing to gamble that the manager\\u2019s office would have a door or a window to the outside.</p>\\n<p>The woman moved toward us, with long, brisk strides, and one hundred percent conviction.\\xa0 When a waiter got in her way, she grabbed him with two hands and shoved him forcefully into the nearest counter.\\xa0 She barely slowed an iota in the process.</p>\\n<p>There were two surefire exits from the room.\\xa0 There was one that she\\u2019d just used to enter the kitchen, and there was one that led from the kitchen to the floor of the theater.</p>\\n<p>Weighing our options, this one strange individual against a room filled with people who had been warned about our existence, I chose the room.</p>\\n<p>With Jamie lagging behind me, I pushed past the free-swinging set of door to enter the

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/08/04/esprit-de-corpse-5-4/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>We weren\\u2019t walking through a kitchen, wearing clothing that resembled that of the staff, not anymore.\\xa0 The pair of us stood out like sore thumbs, our hair a little damp from being under our hoods in the humid outdoors.\\xa0 We wore dirty boots, not shiny black shoes.\\xa0 Jamie carried a backpack.</p>\\n<p>We attracted attention, tramping through people twice our size, who were all wearing their finest.\\xa0 Women had their hair done up, nice dresses on, and the men wore suits with long jackets.\\xa0 There were very few children in attendance, making us stand out all the more.</p>\\n<p>I peered through the crowd, noting the location of everyone important.\\xa0 The kitchen door was in the southeast corner, the stage with the singer to the southwest, and a hundred and fifty feet of banquet hall stretched the distance to the north end, where the front door was.\\xa0 Covered tables dotted the space off to the sides, standing on carpet, while the center remained clear, hardwood, ostensibly for dancing during different events.</p>\\n<p>The ceiling arched above, and a kind of extended balcony ran down either side, with fancy iron-wrought railings, with a number of figures gathered and looking down on the affair from above.\\xa0 Some stood and talked on the stairs that led up from either side of the front door.</p>\\n<p>The rebellion here had brought in a lot of ex-Academy types, and those individuals had each attracted crowds, many staying toward the edges of the hall.\\xa0 The middle had more clusters, but it also had more elbow room and empty space.</p>\\n<p>No matter how we moved through the empty spaces, we would either stand out like sore thumbs, walking in a straight line, or we would look evasive, zig-zagging to break line of sight.</p>\\n<p>The tables offered a little bit of cover, blocking others\\u2019 view of us, and the densely packed people would be something of a benefit in the same way.\\xa0 That said, there was a bit of a caveat to that.\\xa0 There was nothing stopping someone from grabbing one of us.</p>\\n<p>I was counting on a given person leaving us alone because others had left us alone.\\xa0 The mentality of the herd of sheep.\\xa0 It made the initial batch of people more important, as we approached.</p>\\n<p>That in mind, I led the way toward people who looked more actively engaged on conversation.</p>\\n<p>So much planning for the simple act of walking into a crowd.</p>\\n<p>Then again, there was the corollary that we were walking into a crowd of people that would imprison us if they knew we were working for the Crown, and probably shoot us on the spot if they knew what we really were.</p>\\n<p>It was sobering.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I passed just behind a cluster of the group of chattering ladies, into the thick of the crowd.\\xa0 I brought my chin down, ducking down as if begging excuse, and walked at a consistent speed.</p>\\n<p>The pair of us passed behind the core members of the gaggle of chattering women without drawing notice.</p>\\n<p>I was put in mind of one of the covers of Jamie\\u2019s books.\\xa0 The heroine of the haunted forest, every tree hostile but dormant.\\xa0 This was that forest.\\xa0 The \\u2018trees\\u2019 dwarfed us, they outnumbered us to an extent that I couldn\\u2019t guess at, and if they turned on us, I couldn\\u2019t even guess at what they\\u2019d do to us.</p>\\n<p>Countless sets of eyes watched us, judging, prying, thinking about doing something.\\xa0 But it took a special kind of courage to break away from the herd and do something like that.\\xa0 I was watching people, studying them, trying to figure out who might have that courage.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t always obvious.\\xa0 A well dressed man in unique colors, my instinct was that he could be left alone.\\xa0 He tried too hard to impress, by body language alone.</p>\\n<p>An older man, one that looked too frail to kill a fly if he swatted it, I knew he was dangerous by the wide berth others gave him, and the way they reacted when he moved his hands, gesturing.\\xa0 I\\u2019d known professors who moved like he did, swatting students that weren\\u2019t attentive enough, not caring what others thought about them.</p>\\n<p>Once I was pretty sure the coast was clear, I allowed myself a glance back toward the kitchen.\\xa0 The sniffing woman hadn\\u2019t followed us past the kitchen door.\\xa0 I noted that the hostess of the party, Cynthia, stood near the stage, the center of attention for her own small cluster.\\xa0 Jamie, just behind me, looked deeply concerned, one of his hands gripping mine, the other holding the strap of his bag.</p>\\n<p>I saw his eyes flick in one direction.\\xa0 Casually, head turning back to face forward, I looked out of the corner of my eye.</p>\\n<p>The extended balcony on the far left of the room had groups of people talking, just like everywhere else in the banquet hall, but a lone figure stood alone.\\xa0 Bald, he had a scarf covering the lower half of his face, a heavy cast to his forehead, almost neanderthal, and the hands that gripped the railing had long fingers.\\xa0 Knives glinted on the strap that ran diagonally across his chest.</p>\\n<p>He was watching us, his head moving to follow as we made forward progress.</p>\\n<p>I thought I\\u2019d lose track of him as I moved too far head to track him in my peripheral vision, but he turned, and he started walking in the same direction we were, along the length of the balcony, making progress toward the front door.</p>\\n<p><em>Two of them.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Good eye, Jamie.</em></p>\\n<p>I had to wonder where the woman from the kitchen was.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t following us, which was curious.\\xa0 It raised questions.\\xa0 Why not stir up the crowd, call something out and have people mob us or grab us?</p>\\n<p>The first possibility was that her hands were tied.\\xa0 Maybe she couldn\\u2019t speak.\\xa0 Maybe she could, but wasn\\u2019t willing to cause trouble with this event being more important than it looked.</p>\\n<p>The second possibility was that she hadn\\u2019t come after us because she didn\\u2019t <em>need</em> to come after us.\\xa0 We were already caught.</p>\\n<p><em>Three quarters of the way</em>.\\xa0 The last quarter of the hallway stretched before us.</p>\\n<p>The man with the scarf started moving faster, one long finger tracing the top of the railing.\\xa0 He was a little more eager than the woman had been, and the speed he was moving suggested he\\u2019d make it down the stairs and beat us to the front door.</p>\\n<p>I looked, and I didn\\u2019t see windows.\\xa0 There were side doors, likely leading to the theaters, but they weren\\u2019t <em>accessible</em> side doors.\\xa0 The crowds of people around the various scientists and experimenters made it look pretty dire.</p>\\n<p>I picked up the pace a little, my hand tugging on Jamie\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>All at once, the man that was above us stopped, turning, gripping the railing with long fingers.\\xa0 I allowed myself to look, momentarily making eye contact.</p>\\n<p>A moment later, Jamie\\u2019s hand hauled back on mine.\\xa0 My stride was broken, and eyes that had been glancing our way now stared.</p>\\n<p>Jamie had been grabbed.</p>\\n<p>I supposed it had always been a \\u2018when\\u2019 we got grabbed, not \\u2018if\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>He looked shocked, and he didn\\u2019t know what to do.\\xa0 The man that had him was a military sort, with massive mutton chops, badges on his lapel and an odd amount of jewelry on the hand he\\u2019d used to grab Jamie.\\xa0 A very ostentatious wedding band, and a ring that probably signified something military-related.\\xa0 Membership of an important group.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing in here?\\u201d he asked, his voice deep.\\xa0 More heads turned.</p>\\n<p>The attention we were getting was so oppressive I almost couldn\\u2019t breathe.\\xa0 Jamie looked stricken.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia was looking, but I wasn\\u2019t sure she could see <em>us</em>, specifically.\\xa0 The man at the railing remained where he was, watching, fingers rising and falling like a line of something or others was squirming between them and the railing.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d probably seen the man turn and come after us.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t let the fear show in my face.\\xa0 Fear would doom us.</p>\\n<p>I smiled, knowing that my fake smile was being studied by merchants and politicians, people who had made livings off of using or identifying fakery.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLove,\\u201d I said, not looking at the jewelry on his fingers, while remaining acutely aware of it.</p>\\n<p>The man <em>harumphed.\\xa0 \\u201cLove?\\u201d</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrotherly love.\\xa0 This guy and me, we\\u2019re the fastest friends you ever saw, sir.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a girl he likes, I told him, no matter what, he needed to tell her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cT-told you, Simon, y-you really didn\\u2019t have to do that,\\u201d Jamie said, voice shaking a bit.\\xa0 He was drawing on his nervousness, using it.</p>\\n<p><em>Simon.\\xa0 It was my first fake name</em>.\\xa0 Nostalgic.</p>\\n<p>Even my nickname, Sy, it was taken more from Simon than Sylvester.</p>\\n<p>I told myself it was a good omen, and didn\\u2019t allow myself to consider that it might be the last fake name I ever used.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe never thought we\\u2019d see her again.\\xa0 Then we saw her coming here, he\\u2019s dressed nice, we thought- well, I thought and I told him, he\\u2019s gotta say.\\xa0 Before he loses the chance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man didn\\u2019t show any sign of relenting.\\xa0 His face was like stone.\\xa0 Stone with massive muttonchops, but stone all the same.</p>\\n<p>I was still counting on the sheep mentality.\\xa0 That if we stopped this man, convinced <em>him</em>, the rest would let us be.\\xa0 Even managing that would be hard.\\xa0 It depended on Cynthia not coming to see what the commotion was about, and the man at the railing above us staying where he was.</p>\\n<p>A lot of dependings, there.</p>\\n<p>Foremost among them was Muttonchops here.</p>\\n<p>The rings.\\xa0 The way he so proudly displayed the badges.\\xa0 I was counting on him being a romantic at heart.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGirl, hm?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 He sounded skeptical.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe was over there,\\u201d I said, pointing into the crowd.</p>\\n<p>Like magic, the observers parted, stepping away from the path of my fingertip.\\xa0 The only ones who didn\\u2019t were Mr. Ames and our dear Helen.</p>\\n<p>Ames looked like he was going to suffer heart failure.\\xa0 He had already been sweating bullets, and now a full third of the room was now focusing its attention on him and Helen.\\xa0<em>\\xa0</em>He couldn\\u2019t have looked more stricken if someone shoved an icicle up his rear end.</p>\\n<p>I shifted my grip on Jamie, circling around him, so I stood between him and Muttonchops.\\xa0 One hand on each of Jamie\\u2019s shoulders, I <em>pushed</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>The muttonchops, the flash, the display</em>.\\xa0 Not just a romantic.\\xa0 Muttonchops believed in the <em>show</em>.</p>\\n<p>This was for his sake, something gaudy, obvious, impossible to ignore.</p>\\n<p>I believed, wholeheartedly, that he couldn\\u2019t maintain his hold on Jamie without becoming the bad guy, without standing in the way of a boy and his love.\\xa0 Jamie wasn\\u2019t even to blame.\\xa0 It was <em>my</em> fault, I was the one who had dragged him along.</p>\\n<p>The hand dropped away.\\xa0 I pushed Jamie along, and he made a faint show of resisting.</p>\\n<p>We drew closer to the front door.\\xa0 Fifteen percent of the way left.\\xa0 Ten.\\xa0 Five.</p>\\n<p>We reached Helen and Ames.\\xa0 The last few paces to the door were an impossible journey, now.</p>\\n<p>I crossed my left set of fingers, tapping them on Jamie\\u2019s shoulder, to get Helen\\u2019s attention, then shifted my grip.</p>\\n<p>It was a gesture that meant <em>risk.</em></p>\\n<p>Shifting my grip to the left, to indicate the general direction of the man with the scarf.\\xa0 He\\u2019d moved when I wasn\\u2019t looking, and stood on the stairs.</p>\\n<p>Damn it.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t even see Cynthia, but the singer at the far corner of the banquet hall was watching us even as she sang.\\xa0 If Cynthia made it this far, we were doomed.</p>\\n<p>Too many factors to consider.\\xa0 Everything in my perception condensed to this particular moment and scene.\\xa0 I was hyperaware, my every sense pitched to an almost painful degree.\\xa0 We were walking a tightrope.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what to say,\\u201d Jamie said, to Helen.</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s hand moved to her hair.\\xa0 A gesture was hidden in the action.\\xa0 A question mark without a question to precede it.\\xa0 She was as lost as Jamie.\\xa0 Her voice and attitude didn\\u2019t betray it, either way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen you around,\\u201d she said, smiling in a way that probably every man here was familiar with, thinking back on their first loves.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re usually writing something in a big book, aren\\u2019t you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded, swallowing hard.</p>\\n<p><em>I\\u2019m so sorry</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>Very sorry, Jamie, putting you on the spot</em>.</p>\\n<p>It was <em>Ames</em> that spoke, and I felt a moment\\u2019s terror as the heavyset man opened his big fat cannot-act-worth-a-damn mouth.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat do you think you\\u2019re doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The terror wasn\\u2019t substantiated.\\xa0 It came from a very real, very spooked place.\\xa0 He was as terrified as any of us.\\xa0 It was real.</p>\\n<p>His inability to act was a saving grace, almost.\\xa0 The people that knew him would know he was speaking from a genuine place.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI-I really like your daughter, sir,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No</em>,\\u201d Ames boomed.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re making a spectacle of her, and you\\u2019re making a spectacle of <em>me</em>.\\xa0 I will not stand for this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stared, watching in fascination.\\xa0 Was this man actually saving us?</p>\\n<p>He looked genuinely angry.\\xa0 Just like his fear, it came from a real place.\\xa0 We\\u2019d brought the shit to his doorstep, we\\u2019d brought it to people\\u2019s attention, and he wasn\\u2019t happy about any of it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d Jamie said, sounding terrified.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll leave right away.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou most certainly will,\\u201d Ames said.\\xa0 He paused, dramatic.\\xa0 Then, in a less ominous tone, he said, \\u201cIf you wish to see the girl, you can call on her at her home.\\xa0 We live next to the city hall.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Playing to the crowd.\\xa0 He was willing to be the bad guy that Muttonchops hadn\\u2019t, but not entirely.\\xa0 He had probably won some people over with that little display.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded, a little too quickly.\\xa0 This time, it was Jamie who tugged me in the direction of the front door.\\xa0 I was more than happy to oblige, very aware of the man with the scarf and the knives who was now walking at a casual pace down the stairs.</p>\\n<p>We were two steps from the exit when a hand slapped the heavy wood.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t recognize the man, but he wore one of the unconventional uniforms, with a mustache so thin it looked like it was drawn on with a scratch of a quill.\\xa0 The slap on the wood made a dull booming noise, and it drew more attention.\\xa0 I noted that several of the special guests looked annoyed at the focus that was being drawn away from them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re leaving,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want any trouble.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like to stop you right there,\\u201d the man said, his voice soft.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, but I know I wasn\\u2019t the only one here that was instructed to assume that anything a young child says is an outright lie, until proven otherwise.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Oh no.</em></p>\\n<p><em>No, no, no</em>.</p>\\n<p>It went a step beyond paranoia and general knowledge of us.</p>\\n<p>The damn woman had known we were here.\\xa0 She had warned people.</p>\\n<p>I looked, and I saw people in the crowd looking a little abashed that they hadn\\u2019t been the ones to say the very same thing.\\xa0 Others that had been given the same instruction.</p>\\n<p>I also saw Cynthia approaching, weaving her way through the crowd, gently excusing herself to get past others.\\xa0 She was roughly the same distance from the door that we\\u2019d been when Jamie had been grabbed.\\xa0 Thirty or forty feet from the door, albeit with a dense thicket of people between here and there.</p>\\n<p>The man with the scarf hadn\\u2019t budged.</p>\\n<p>Why.\\xa0 He and the woman in the kitchen-</p>\\n<p>No, there were more important things to focus on.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t fuck up here like I did in so many of the actual fights.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLying about what?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe story.\\xa0 Your reason for being here,\\u201d the man with the thin mustache said.\\xa0 \\u201cTo get here in the first place, you had to come from one of the theaters, or you came from the kitchen.\\xa0 Is it unfair of us to worry that the Academy might be low enough to use young children to deliver poison to an entire banquet?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Oh.\\xa0 Well, had to give the man points for imagination.</p>\\n<p>Even <em>I</em> was at a loss for words there.</p>\\n<p>I pulled my hand away from Jamie, the hand between me and the exterior wall gesturing before clenching into a fist.</p>\\n<p>The only person who could see it and translate the gesture\\u2019s meaning was Helen.</p>\\n<p><em>Help.</em></p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t know how she managed it without opening her mouth, but our dear, glorious Helen directed Ames our way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re accusing <em>this girl</em> of poisoning food?\\u201d Ames asked, voice rising.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat is not what I\\u2019m saying,\\u201d the man at the door said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re accusing <em>me</em> of being a traitor?\\u201d Ames asked, even louder.</p>\\n<p><em>I am so very glad nobody said yes to that question</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d the man said, patiently.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m saying we don\\u2019t know for sure where these boys are from, or if the story about the romance-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s true!\\u201d I said, cutting him off.\\xa0 Ames was acting the outraged parent, but he apparently didn\\u2019t know how important it was to keep our opponent from getting his balance, or keeping the man from getting a full sentence out.\\xa0 Playing dirty was absolutely vital here.\\xa0 \\u201cHe likes her, he does!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re raising nonsense about poison here, laying accusations, scaring good people,\\u201d Ames said, getting more into it.\\xa0 I worried he didn\\u2019t know where he was going, or that he\\u2019d run out of steam and abruptly stop, leaving us flailing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m following orders!\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia was getting closer.\\xa0 If she <em>verified</em> those orders-</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s got a picture,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Without waiting for Jamie to do it, I pulled the rain-flap of his backpack away, reached inside, and hauled out the book.\\xa0 He took it from me the moment I had it, and turned pages.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy would he have a picture if he\\u2019s lying?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie held the book up, a half-done sketch of Helen displayed.</p>\\n<p>It was a little dark and scratchy, heavy on the ink.\\xa0 Not quite the picture a boy in love might draw, by my estimation, but it was a picture of Helen, and it was pretty damn accurate.</p>\\n<p>There were murmurs from the crowd that could see the book.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s enough,\\u201d Ames said.\\xa0 He approached us, \\u201cIt\\u2019s clear you like her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia was close enough to be in earshot, now.\\xa0 She was looking at the man with the scarf and the knives, but he wasn\\u2019t moving.</p>\\n<p>That somehow spooked me more than if he\\u2019d suddenly lunged for us.</p>\\n<p>Ames put a hand on Jamie\\u2019s shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cCome.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s talk, away from all this.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t like the spectacle.\\xa0 You can come to our place, for tea and cake, if the girl agrees.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like that,\\u201d Helen said, just behind me.</p>\\n<p>His other hand touched the door handle, a few feet below where the man with the thin mustache had slammed his own hand against the wood.</p>\\n<p>The man wasn\\u2019t budging, even with Ames up close and personal, the book as proof.</p>\\n<p>Damnation, someone actually competent, who listened to orders.</p>\\n<p>Ames hauled the door open, ignoring the hand.\\xa0 His strength contested the man\\u2019s, and Ames won.</p>\\n<p>The man looked over in Cynthia\\u2019s direction, and I did too.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d stopped moving.\\xa0 She watched.</p>\\n<p>Ames passed through the door with Jamie.\\xa0 Helen caught up, and joined me in leaving.</p>\\n<p>I felt ill at ease, well aware that I didn\\u2019t have the full picture.</p>\\n<p>The front of the theater was covered.\\xa0 The rain poured beyond, flowing between the stones of the slightly domed street and into the gutters.</p>\\n<p>The door closed behind us.\\xa0 We headed in the direction of the small adjunct building.\\xa0 Two black men on either side of the double doors opened the way.\\xa0 We stepped into the coat room, Ames and Helen found coats and pulled them on.\\xa0 Jamie found a smaller cloak and donned it.\\xa0 I searched and didn\\u2019t find anything small enough for me.</p>\\n<p>The sniffing woman had my coat.</p>\\n<p>Jamie found an umbrella and handed it to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was that?\\u201d Ames murmured, once we were out and walking in the rain, out of earshot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know that whole blackmail thing we had going on?\\u201d I asked, twisting around to check behind us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI believe I know what you\\u2019re talking about,\\u201d Ames said, with a heavy lathering of sarcasm and a little bit of loathing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re done,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s over.\\xa0 All that you have left to do is keep quiet, and nobody finds out about the\\u2026 less decorous parts of your military background.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A lifetime ago, he\\u2019d gone to a black market doctor and found a way to avoid attending a major battle in service to the Academy, a wounded leg and a bad infection.\\xa0 He\\u2019d survived when many of his colleagues hadn\\u2019t, had then been able to boast a rare level of experience, when so many who had fought in the battles he had had died.\\xa0 Now he was here, and he\\u2019d sided with the rebellion.</p>\\n<p>In trying to meet and buy off some of the ex-students of the Academy, we\\u2019d found out about that bit of leverage, and played it out into our whole scheme here.\\xa0 One of the higher-ups in the local rebellion became our pawn, a means of Jamie getting access to important paperwork and a hiding spot, while Helen could be the daughter returned home after a long time away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve ruined me,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cPeople will put the pieces together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPeople would have found out eventually,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe doctor who injured your leg knew exactly what he was doing when he named you.\\xa0 The moment he was caught, or the moment he was brought into the rebellion, he was ready to name you for his personal gain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shook his head, but he didn\\u2019t have anything to say.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we\\u2019re done, does that mean there\\u2019s no tea?\\u201d Helen asked.\\xa0 With a slightly different inflection, she added, \\u201cAnd no cake?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo tea, no cake,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMr. Ames-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGeneral Ames,\\u201d Ames corrected.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d goaded him about the fact that his title wasn\\u2019t truly earned, but I had to admit he\\u2019d done a lot to help us just now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGeneral Ames,\\u201d I amended my statement.\\xa0 \\u201cOur business relationship with you is done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m done with <em>her</em>, then?\\u201d he asked, indicating Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas I so bad?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou <em>disturb</em> me,\\u201d he said, with a measure of disgust.</p>\\n<p>Helen pouted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo home, figure out what to do next,\\u201d I told Ames.\\xa0 \\u201cI advise leaving.\\xa0 Just to be safe.\\xa0 Put some distance between yourself and the rest of this.\\xa0 Maybe play up how embarrassed you were with your treatment in there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shook his head, jowls wobbling.</p>\\n<p>All at once, he turned, breaking away from us, as if he couldn\\u2019t bear to be in our company any longer.</p>\\n<p>Jamie, Helen and I walked through the rain.\\xa0 We passed several people.\\xa0 The rain was thick enough it was hard to identify details.\\xa0 I might have imagined vaguely monstrous details about anyone we passed, except many of them <em>were</em> monsters, or stitched, or something-or-others.</p>\\n<p>Was the sniffing woman out here?\\xa0 Or did the rain keep her from tracking us like she had with the coats and following us into the kitchen?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, I didn\\u2019t expect any of that,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought I\\u2019d be busy for a little while yet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to be busy,\\u201d I said, \\u201cJust doing something different than we were.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I continued to examine each of the people out on the street.\\xa0 Were any watching us?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGetting cake can be on the list,\\u201d Jamie said, \\u201cI\\u2019m sure Sy didn\\u2019t mean to tease.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen reached out to give Jamie a pat on the cheek.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI always mean to tease,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cExcept then.\\xa0 No, I didn\\u2019t mean to there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re the best boys,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat about the other boy?\\xa0 And our girls?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat,\\u201d I said, \\u201cremains a very good question.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia back there, she <em>wanted</em> us.\\xa0 She was coming after us, she had the ability to give the order, and I think she probably would have been listened to.\\xa0 Now, there\\u2019s a dim possibility that she changed her mind, bought the story\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you don\\u2019t think so,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe changed her mind for another reason.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe man with the scarf on the stairs, he gave her some signal, or he communicated something, and she <em>deferred</em> to him.\\xa0 I\\u2019m guessing they don\\u2019t believe three birds in the hand are worth however many are in the bush.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re <em>using</em> us,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re being watched, right this second,\\u201d I murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cGuarantee it.\\xa0 They want us to lead them to the others before they make a move.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s get Helen her cake-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-and figure out our next move.\\xa0 Because we\\u2019re stuck.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t communicate with or meet up with the others without putting them and ourselves in danger.\\xa0 We have a tail to shake, and the moment Mr. Scarf finishes discussing a strategy with Mrs. Cynthia, we\\u2019re going to have an entire city\\u2019s worth of hostile forces collapsing in on us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd Mary, Lillian, and Gordon might too, except they won\\u2019t have any warning at all,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s do what we can about that,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/08/18/esprit-de-corpse/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The stitched gave each of us a pat-down.\\xa0 I bit my cheek rather than protest at the pain as clumsy hands prodded my side.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t worth it, the stitched wouldn\\u2019t care, and I didn\\u2019t want to seem weak, when we already had two members down.\\xa0 The older man, now with his helmet doffed, was studying us.\\xa0 Jamie and Helen were looking less than stellar, even with their injuries looked after.\\xa0 I could put on a brave face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt would be easier-\\u201d Mary started.\\xa0 She made a face as the stitched pulled a knife out from her beltline.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you\\u2019d let me remove the knives myself.\\xa0 Or I can tell you where they all are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The stitched didn\\u2019t react or respond, and the Brigadier didn\\u2019t give the order.</p>\\n<p>We waited in silence while it found eight more knives, each belted around Mary\\u2019s upper thighs.\\xa0 It gave her a quick pat-down, then stood straight.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I may\\u2026\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She reached up and pulled a long, thin knife out from the thickest part of her hair.\\xa0 More a needle than a blade.\\xa0 She raised one foot up, bracing calf against knee, and pulled another knife free of the heel of her shoe with a bit of a jerk.\\xa0 Rather than a handle, it had a t-shaped configuration, more a knife that was punched with than thrust.\\xa0 A matching knife came out of the other shoe.</p>\\n<p>She deposited two more, another punching knife from behind her belt buckle, and one with fluid in a reservoir in the handle from behind her back.\\xa0 Finally, she provided the garotte-wire that had been curled around her body, hidden on the other side of her belt.</p>\\n<p>Absolutely, utterly unnecessary.\\xa0 She could have kept the items on her person and lost nothing for it, but I suspected she wanted to make a point.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll have to teach them to do better,\\u201d the Brigadier observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>The Brigadier was old, a caricature of a man with a puffed out chest, bedecked in a uniform jacket, with tight leggings beneath, making it seem like his upper body was meant for a different lower body than the one he had.\\xa0 He had kind eyes, as he appraised us.</p>\\n<p>I instantly disliked him.</p>\\n<p>He looked at the man who still sat on the bench of the coach, his ankles bound.\\xa0 The man looked deeply uncomfortable and embarrassed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSee that Specialist Timothy gets care.\\xa0 Patrick, see that your stitched search the vehicle for more spiders.\\xa0 Lambs, you can come inside,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ll talk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We passed through the doors, joined by the stitched guards.\\xa0 Formations seemed to have been ingrained into them.\\xa0 As we moved two-by-two, the stitched did as well, two between Jamie and I and Mary and Lillian, and two at the rear.</p>\\n<p>Past the doors was a coatroom, and we quickly removed our things.\\xa0 Adult-sized shoes were on the floor.\\xa0 The Brigadier paused, taking in the shoes, examining us and our feet, then said, \\u201cif you wouldn\\u2019t mind carrying on the rest of the way in socks and stockings?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Dutifully, we peeled off our raincoats and boots.\\xa0 I stepped onto the wooden floor beyond the coatroom, lifted up one foot, and saw a muddy print.\\xa0 The grime and the wet had soaked into my boots.\\xa0 My socks were just as dirty as the soles of my boots, if not dirtier.</p>\\n<p>I peeled off my wet socks and progressed barefoot, which was only slightly better.</p>\\n<p>The Brigadier had chosen a <em>lodge</em> as his base of operations.\\xa0 It was one of the largest buildings, one of the sturdiest, and I suspected that had little to nothing to do with his choice.\\xa0 The exterior was stone and mortar, up to a point that was just over the top of my head, with logs extending up the rest of the way.\\xa0 The roof had a tree growing across it, augmented building, and swept up at an angle, the lowest point just over the front door, the highest point of the roof at the far end, where a chimney speared up from a stone fireplace-cum-stove.\\xa0 It looked like a bedroom and bathroom were to either side of the coat room, tucked in at the front.\\xa0 The remainder was an open living space, with tables surrounded by nice chairs and a couch, a desk was positioned near the fireplace, and the only piece of furniture that didn\\u2019t match the decor had been placed opposite the desk, a heavy table.</p>\\n<p>A stitched boy was feeding the fire.\\xa0 No older than I was.\\xa0 Probably the Brigadier\\u2019s personal servant.\\xa0 He looked like he\\u2019d been around for a while, a stitched with actual stitches.</p>\\n<p>The Brigadier was a man who liked his comforts.\\xa0 A candle burned above the desk, and a glass held ice but no drink.\\xa0 If I smelled him, I could smell a trace of drink, but not the sour tang of an alcoholic.\\xa0 As the boy and his style of dress suggested, he was a man who took care of things.</p>\\n<p>Hard to read, when it came to this situation.\\xa0 He was so wrapped up in himself that I couldn\\u2019t get a good sense of who he was as a strategist.</p>\\n<p>Maybe that was a hint unto itself.</p>\\n<p>We walked all the way to the end of the room, passing the area that served as a sitting room or a tea room, where books and maps were laid out.\\xa0 The wood of the floor got progressively warmer as we approached the fireplace.\\xa0 By the time we reached the end, it was hot enough to be on the cusp of uncomfortable.\\xa0 I glanced over the table opposite the desk, and saw far more maps, as well as various letters.\\xa0 Pens were scattered here and there.</p>\\n<p>He took a seat at the desk.\\xa0 \\u201cIf the injured feel the need to sit, you could take one of the chairs behind you and turn it around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie did.\\xa0 He dropped his backpack on the floor by the chair.\\xa0 Helen remained where she was.</p>\\n<p>I did, too.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhitney is under attack, then,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe moved too soon.\\xa0 We hoped they would be active late at night.\\xa0 When the majority of people were deep asleep, and we hoped there would be more.\\xa0 Enough that their first few attempts to eradicate the spiders would fail.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you were nearly ready.\\xa0 You said as much in a recent missive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot that close.\\xa0 Account for the fact that they\\u2019ll respond faster in the daytime, it won\\u2019t be enough.\\xa0 I\\u2019d say we have less than a day before the window of opportunity closes,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think you\\u2019re underestimating what that kind of psychological warfare will accomplish,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re well versed in that kind of warfare, we\\u2019ve dealt with experts in it for as long as we\\u2019ve been working together,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich obviously isn\\u2019t that long,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot to belittle what you do, of course.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Only those who knew Gordon would be aware of the subtle change of tone, or the hints that he was working just a little too hard to keep his words carefully crafted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ll break,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019ll put them on their heels.\\xa0 People will leave Whitney, too afraid of a repeat performance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s more complicated than that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course it is!\\u201d he said, in a laughing tone.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are always nuances and complications.\\xa0 This is <em>war</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Brigadier Ernest Tylor lifted his glass, drinking the water from the melted ice, then opened a drawer to retrieve a bottle of what might have been scotch.\\xa0 He tipped it into the glass.</p>\\n<p>He saw us watching, and he smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cThe ice is a travesty, I know, but I allow it because it goes so well with the heat of the fire.\\xa0 I\\u2019d offer you drinks, to thank you for your hard work, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gestured, a kind of up-down motion.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut we\\u2019re too short?\\u201d I asked, feigning confusion.</p>\\n<p>Jamie elbowed me from the left, and Mary kicked my leg.\\xa0 It hurt <em>more</em> than if she\\u2019d been wearing her shoes.\\xa0 Somehow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s fine, sir,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cTwo of us can\\u2019t even drink, and I can\\u2019t even enjoy it in the same ways, myself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStrange group,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 He was barely drinking what he\\u2019d poured for himself.\\xa0 One sip.\\xa0 A gesture of power?\\xa0 Habit?</p>\\n<p>I watched and waited for him to take another sip.</p>\\n<p>The moment he did, I opened my mouth, knowing he couldn\\u2019t cut me off without sputtering.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir,\\u201d I said, \\xa0 \\u201cIn all seriousness, what I was saying before, about complications.\\xa0 They\\u2019re more prepared than you may be giving them credit for.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He swallowed, stayed like that, glass in hand, then set it down.\\xa0 \\u201cHow so?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree or four assassins, skilled, each augmented.\\xa0 One of them was an uncanny shot with a rifle from about a kilometer away.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He raised his eyebrows and nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re confident.\\xa0 They know the resources you have to bear, they have countermeasures in place.\\xa0 They have resources, some ace up their sleeve that we weren\\u2019t able to uncover before we had to flee the assassins.\\xa0 They think they\\u2019re going to win this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen they\\u2019re idiots,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe outnumber them threefold.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVirtually every soldier they have has a gun they\\u2019ve nicknamed the Exorcist.\\xa0 Designed to put down stitched and augmented creatures.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot a concern.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve led armies in battle.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve even managed situations like this.\\xa0 A fortified position, an insurgent groups with numbers on their side.\\xa0 Those numbers swiftly dwindle at the first hint of defeat.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve delivered that, and I\\u2019ll see that you get medals for it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary reached out and took my hand.\\xa0 I squeezed it.</p>\\n<p>The look she gave me out of the corner of her eye was one of worry.\\xa0 The hand-holding was for reassurance, not for some desire to celebrate the recognition and the victory.</p>\\n<p>Yeah.\\xa0 That feeling we\\u2019d had was getting worse.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere were scientists.\\xa0 Ex-Academy.\\xa0 This isn\\u2019t rabble, sir,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey have knowledge they can bring to bear.\\xa0 Experiments of their own.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLouis Peralta,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe specialized in pain.\\xa0 Leopold Pock, produced modified, vat grown humans, of a different type than the assassins we encountered.\\xa0 Edwin Grahl, John Durant, Christina Wilder, Ian Roy, Wesley Vas-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI get the picture,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow many total?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEleven.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man nodded, rubbing his beard.\\xa0 \\u201cAt a certain point, it becomes academic.\\xa0 Assuming the guns are twice as effective as the norm, the experiments all Academy class, they still have to reach us before they can take action.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReach us, sir?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re mounting an attack against an entrenched position.\\xa0 We have a number of tools at our disposal, and we can frustrate their efforts.\\xa0 Trust me when I say this, war is a psychological game.\\xa0 Once they realize the cost of attacking, on top of your clever work with the spiders, their numbers will dwindle.\\xa0 Without the support of the group, their hired scholars will drop away as well.\\xa0 There will be nobody to hold the guns you\\u2019ve mentioned.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t intend to attack,\\u201d Mary said, the disappointment and disbelief clear in her voice.\\xa0 \\u201cYou want to stay, fight from a defensive standpoint.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExactly so,\\u201d the man said, smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t even try to hide the accusatory tone.</p>\\n<p>I squeezed her hand, a warning.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow refreshing,\\u201d the old man said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not usually made to explain myself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He waved a hand.\\xa0 \\u201cI always firmly believed that every person in a position of power should have to explain their rationale.\\xa0 Your name, if you don\\u2019t mind?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho are we fighting against, Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInsurgents.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Rebels, revolutionaries, insurgents.\\xa0 But who makes up the bulk of their number?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary took a second, then connected the dots.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Crown\\u2019s people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAssume we fought every fight by wiping out the enemy.\\xa0 What would happen after?\\xa0 The Academy would suffer, the Crown would suffer.\\xa0 There would be long-lasting repercussions.\\xa0 Resentment, hatred.\\xa0 If we can minimize the losses on both sides, and still break their stride, if we do it with <em>care</em>, then we could very well leave them feeling thankful that we were as merciful as we were.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I wondered if the higher-ups at Radham were laughing.\\xa0 Hayle had made a gambit, sending us here.\\xa0 He\\u2019d believed we could be useful.\\xa0 Had someone with experience with the Crown\\u2019s military allowed him to do just that, knowing just what we\\u2019d have to deal with?</p>\\n<p>There wasn\\u2019t a Lamb present, I knew, who wasn\\u2019t filled to the brim with frustration.\\xa0 We\\u2019d gathered information, we\\u2019d positioned ourselves, we\\u2019d set up a trap that would lay them low enough that an army could sweep over them without much contest, and here we were.</p>\\n<p>I looked either way, down the line of Lambs.\\xa0 Lillian, at the far left end, was staring down at the floor.\\xa0 Her neck was rigid enough I wondered if she\\u2019d start trembling.</p>\\n<p>The others weren\\u2019t much better.</p>\\n<p>So very little gained.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t paying attention to the information.\\xa0 Lillian and Shipman\\u2019s notes on how far along they were in terms of knowing about the Academy were effectively being ignored, as was Jamie\\u2019s information on the local threats, and my details on the assassins.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe spiders were a good ploy.\\xa0 I\\u2019m glad I extended you the trust and signed off on it.\\xa0 Tell me, what\\u2019s next for you?\\xa0 If you want it, I\\u2019d be happy to extend you some freedom.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFreedom, sir?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI imagine the Academy keeps you busy.\\xa0 If you\\u2019d like, I can tell them I have need of you, and keep you for a few days.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a little drab here, mines and lodges, a lot of damnable rain, but you could rest and recuperate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon glanced at the rest of us, then said, \\u201cSpeaking for all of us, sir, the offer is appreciated-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcellent.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut I think we\\u2019d prefer to be useful, if you don\\u2019t mind my saying so.\\xa0 Those of us who aren\\u2019t injured.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cAny particular duties you have in mind?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething pertaining to the upcoming situation, sir?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing to be had but turns at the watch, and trust me when I say you don\\u2019t want that task.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a punishment detail.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet me get back to you on that tomorrow, then?\\u201d the man asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s getting later in the day.\\xa0 Recuperate, take a well-earned rest.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll be staying in the Miner\\u2019s camp.\\xa0 Nicer place to stay than you\\u2019d think.\\xa0 Some officers and specialists there, but you\\u2019ll have enough space that you shouldn\\u2019t want for privacy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was the first person I\\u2019d met who could take the Lambs in stride at first meeting, recognizing what we were and how we operated.\\xa0 Gordon\\u2019s letters might have helped with that.\\xa0 He was also gentle, and not above treating us with kindness.\\xa0 That he\\u2019d actually considered offering us drinks said a lot. There was no deception at all in what he was saying.\\xa0 He believed it all, deep down.\\xa0 That veteranship of experience had layered and ingrained it all into him.\\xa0 A very rare species, no doubt a grandfather, and a veteran of the Academy\\u2019s wars, his experiences mingling into someone who actually almost understood us.</p>\\n<p>I could count the number of people who fit that label with three fingers.\\xa0 Hayle was the first.\\xa0 This man was the third.</p>\\n<p>Yet, in my frustration, there was nothing I wanted to do than jam my thumbs into the orbs of his eyes and hear him scream.\\xa0 Because he was too kind in expression as he looked down on us, because I was sure I saw a glimmer of pity that came from a place of actual understanding.</p>\\n<p>It was a surprisingly violent line of thought, even for me.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d been dismissed.\\xa0 The others were already turning to go.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t turned, and I still held Mary\\u2019s hand, so she hadn\\u2019t gone either.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Do you mind mentioning your name, while we\\u2019re talking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>I took that as my cue to continue.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you\\u2019re really grateful about what we\\u2019ve done-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI am, Sylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen I\\u2019d like to maintain a responsibility, in the meantime.\\xa0 I\\u2019d need a bit of help.\\xa0 I want to do some patrol rounds around Westmore, personally.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s bigger than it looks, you know.\\xa0 It worms between hills and mountains.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat help do you need?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re each carrying silver badges.\\xa0 They have the Radham emblem on them,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I fished mine out of my pocket.\\xa0 \\u201cWould you pass on word to your soldiers, that we can go where we need to and make minor requests?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He considered.\\xa0 \\u201cIf it were to fall into an enemy\\u2019s hands\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere aren\\u2019t any children among them, as far as we know,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He rubbed his beard, musing.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy, then?\\xa0 We have the patrols covered.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause they hired assassins.\\xa0 As we mentioned earlier, there are three or four,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I paused for effect.\\xa0 I wished this would sink in, convince him that this was a different sort of battle, that the enemy was <em>smarter.\\xa0 </em>\\u201cI doubt they hired assassins to keep them in Whitney.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you deem it necessary, then I\\u2019ll spread the word down the chain of command.\\xa0 You\\u2019re free to go where you need to, and to make minor orders.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank <em>you</em>, Sylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I had the vivid mental image of the eye-piercing and screaming again.\\xa0 Mary let go of my hand to head to the coatroom, leaving me behind.</p>\\n<p>I turned and crossed the length of the Brigadier\\u2019s lodge to join the others, who were flanked on either side by the stitched who had come into the door, now standing on either side of the coatroom.\\xa0 I ignored the discarded socks, depositing them into the raincoat pocket, and simply slipped my feet into my boots.\\xa0 There were tiny rocks in there with the silty mud, but it was far from the most irritating thing to happen today.</p>\\n<p>Among the Lambs, there was an odd kind of rush to get out the door and get away.</p>\\n<p>We covered a lot of ground before we were far enough away from the Brigadier\\u2019s men to talk.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d Mary asked, sounding genuinely lost.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause the Academy doesn\\u2019t lose wars,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t make any sense,\\u201d Mary told me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt makes all the sense in the world,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s never lost a war.\\xa0\\xa0 He could lose this <em>battle, </em>sure.\\xa0 He could lose the next five.\\xa0 But if the dust settles and he\\u2019s alive, which he probably will be, then what can the Academy say?\\xa0 The failure is theirs, not his.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary made a fist, then moved like she was going to punch a wall.\\xa0 She stopped just short.</p>\\n<p>A moment later, Lillian slammed the side of her fist into the wall, a few feet from Mary\\u2019s.\\xa0 She waggled it, wincing in pain, looking like she\\u2019d regretted the gesture.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou <em>really</em> hated that school, huh?\\u201d I observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought hitting things was supposed to help relieve anger,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cOw.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian made a face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI need to teach you how to throw a punch,\\u201d Mary observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t make me feel <em>worse</em>,\\u201d Lillian muttered.</p>\\n<p>It was getting dark, the rain was coming down hard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s about risk and reward,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cGoing back to our earlier topic, not hitting things.\\xa0 Attacking Whitney is a risk.\\xa0 His career, life, and control of the situation come into jeopardy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The words weren\\u2019t helping with the general aura of frustration that seemed to linger.\\xa0 Only Helen and Shipman seemed able to be able to handle it.\\xa0 Shipman had a few years of maturity and probably some experience in seeing her hard work thrown away.\\xa0 Helen might not even experience frustration in the same way we did.</p>\\n<p>We could have stood there in the rain for hours, kicking at the mud with our toes and grumbling.\\xa0 It was Gordon who got us moving.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe might be arguing about nothing at all, if the man is right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s not,\\u201d I pointed out.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s missing just how angry and dedicated our opposition is.\\xa0 They won\\u2019t break as easily as he thinks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said, sounding exasperated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d I replied, mimicking his tone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not arguing with you.\\xa0 I\\u2019m inclined to agree.\\xa0 But there\\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s go see where we\\u2019re staying,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cGet our wounded looked after.\\xa0 Yourself included, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t going to say anything,\\u201d I lied.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He paused.\\xa0 \\u201cThe patrols.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo ulterior motives,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI just didn\\u2019t want to get cooped up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Wasn\\u2019t going to ask about that.\\xa0 Was just going to ask, do you mind if any of us come with you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou want to patrol,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 And from the looks of it, Helen and Mary do too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll make a thing of it.\\xa0 Go in pairs, maybe.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve been split up for too long, doing our individual things, be nice to talk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A shout.</p>\\n<p>The crack of a dozen rifles firing.</p>\\n<p>Another shout, ordering a reload.</p>\\n<p>A violent explosion, screams.</p>\\n<p>It was so dark we couldn\\u2019t see, except when the explosions lit things up.\\xa0 The dead of night.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and I were on the wall overlooking the sloped, waterlogged road that led down through the mountains to Whitney.\\xa0 We peered over the top, watching the scene unfold.</p>\\n<p>From atop the wall, an entire regiment\\u2019s worth of rifles fired.</p>\\n<p>Bullets weren\\u2019t weightless.\\xa0 They dropped as they traveled.\\xa0 Having the high ground counted for something, I imagined.</p>\\n<p>Not that I was much of a fighter, or an expert on guns.</p>\\n<p>I watched as a series of explosions ripped out.\\xa0 Something was coming up the path.\\xa0 Stitched, but big, not all human.\\xa0 It probably had a short lifespan.\\xa0 But it wasn\\u2019t intended to live out an extended life of servitude.\\xa0 It was about shock, awe, and giving our side a reason to <em>doubt</em>, if only for a minute.\\xa0 It was holding a modified cannon in its arms.\\xa0 It nearly fell as the cannon fired.</p>\\n<p>The collision shook the wall.\\xa0 I could hear stones from the wall falling to the road below.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and I had been mid-patrol when the alert was sounded.\\xa0 Now we watched.</p>\\n<p>Westmore\\u2019s stitched were firing in barrages.\\xa0 I watched them, saw another flash of light as an explosion occurred further down the road, the scene highlighted in oranges and reds.</p>\\n<p>Another explosion.\\xa0 The group of stitched was one fewer.\\xa0 It took me a second to spot why.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHead down!\\u201d I shouted in Gordon\\u2019s ear.\\xa0 Louder than was necessary, maybe.\\xa0 The explosions and gunfire was making my ears ring.</p>\\n<p>He ducked down with me, a quizzical look on his face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe rifleman with the eyes, the same one who shot me.\\xa0 He\\u2019s picking off the commanders of the Stitched\\u2019s squads.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell someone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at the scene.\\xa0 Just when I spotted a person who looked like he was in charge, he turned, walking the other direction, gesturing.</p>\\n<p>A group of specialists in a nearby building opened a cage.</p>\\n<p>The thing that came out was a dog without a head.\\xa0 The stump was an open void, and tendrils spilled out and peeled back over the dog\\u2019s body, streaming behind it as it ran.</p>\\n<p>Sharp whistles directed it, two for left, one for right, volume guiding it.</p>\\n<p>It went over the top of the wall, pouncing.</p>\\n<p>I heard gunshots, listened, trying to identify the rifleman\\u2019s.\\xa0 Knowing the dog would be taking the man\\u2019s focus, I dared a look over the top.</p>\\n<p>There was a crowd at the end of the road, approaching with makeshift shields up to cover them.\\xa0 They\\u2019d reached the collection of sandbags furthest down the road, the same one that the poor sod that had gotten his legs stitched together had come from.\\xa0 It became cover for them.</p>\\n<p>I imagined someone was supposed to keep that from happening, but the people who were supposed to make the call were getting picked off.</p>\\n<p>The tendril-dog was limping forward, momentum broken.\\xa0 Stitched were dying in droves.\\xa0 They were supposed to take a half-dozen bullets before going down.\\xa0 They were taking one or two at most.</p>\\n<p>The \\u2018exorcist\\u2019 rifles were doing their job.</p>\\n<p>Gordon pulled on my shoulder, and I ducked down.\\xa0 He gestured, and I gestured back.</p>\\n<p>We descended the stairs at our side of the wall, back to the ground level.\\xa0 A gun was briefly trained on us, before we were recognized.</p>\\n<p>We had to cross the length of the street before the sounds on the far side of the wall grew muffled enough that we could talk.\\xa0 I spoke, looking at the forces massed on our side of the wall. \\xa0 \\u201cThey need to sound a retreat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo retreat,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey won\\u2019t.\\xa0 They can\\u2019t.\\xa0 It\\u2019s only a half-dozen men out there who die, and a lot of stitched.\\xa0 If they open the gate, there\\u2019s no guarantee they\\u2019ll be able to close it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey won\\u2019t get through,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot tonight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably not tonight.\\xa0 This was them saying they\\u2019re here.\\xa0 They\\u2019re angry, they haven\\u2019t given up.\\xa0 Someone in charge probably stirred them up.\\xa0 People who weren\\u2019t committed to the fight picked up guns, even.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSy.\\xa0 I want to ask everyone, but since you <em>saw</em>, I\\u2019ll ask you first.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We were getting further away from the site of the battle, the volume was dying down, and the horrible ringing in my ears seemed to be getting louder in comparison.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAsk what?\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think he\\u2019ll change his mind?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, without missing a beat.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019ll adapt his strategy, he\\u2019ll make an excuse.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat they expended resources.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll be weaker on subsequent attempts,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething like that.\\xa0 You were thinking the same thing?\\xa0 That he\\u2019d say no?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.</p>\\n<p>I had a funny feeling about the way he was acting, which was strange.\\xa0 Gordon wasn\\u2019t a guy I usually devoted a lot of brainpower to figuring out, and now I\\u2019d done it twice in recent memory.\\xa0 Thrice if I counted Fray.</p>\\n<p>Okay, I was lying.\\xa0 A million, six hundred thousand and two times, if I counted Fray.</p>\\n<p>But the strange mood in the market, how he\\u2019d been oddly out of sorts and avoiding the heavy lifting when I\\u2019d seen him earlier in the day and how this?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy does the group need to make a collective call about what the Brigadier is doing?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIt would have to be important, for you to ask for something like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Except I already knew the answer.\\xa0 The look in Gordon\\u2019s eyes, faint as it was with only the streetlamp to go by, was telling enough.\\xa0 He knew I\\u2019d figured it out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHm.\\xa0 It might be hard to convince some of the others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTreason is typically pretty hard to sell,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p><a

sounds of shells and gunfire in the background were joined by a singular, high screech.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo si-\\u201d Mary started to say, before the sharp crack of an explosion stopped her.\\xa0 She winced.\\xa0 \\u201cNo sign of the assassins.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne was on the battlefield,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSy\\u2019s gunman.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy is he mine?\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want him!\\u201d I protested.</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s eyes had lit up with anticipation at Gordon\\u2019s statement, however.\\xa0 \\u201cThe others have to be close.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll do what we can,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to talk.\\xa0 And not about them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re an issue,\\u201d Mary said, insistent.</p>\\n<p><em>And here is the point that marks the difference between Gordon and Mary, </em>I mused.\\xa0 Gordon was flexible, he was well rounded enough to adapt.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s focus had been honed to a point.\\xa0 She was wired to go after an enemy.\\xa0 Her \\u2018parents\\u2019, as it were, but even so.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDangerous enemy,\\u201d I agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cI can attest.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>A rolling rumble, like thunder, marked the collapse of a part of the mountainside, cliff, or road.\\xa0 My heart was racing, just hearing it all.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut all the talking in the world won\\u2019t uncover more about them,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ll keep an eye out, work under the assumption they\\u2019re here, but there\\u2019s something more complicated we need to discuss.\\xa0 The assassins are only a small part of the big picture.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey nearly killed you,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou want to ignore that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The gunfire in the background was incessant. It didn\\u2019t help that, as we walked beneath eaves as a trio, I would occasionally get a fat sucker of a raindrop dropping down with considerable force.\\xa0 Just enough of a \\u2018tap\\u2019 that a small part of me thought I\\u2019d been shot again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, Mary,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 I sighed a little.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat do you want to do?\\xa0 What are you thinking would be best,

manner of speaking.\\xa0 \\u201cThey could come after us or any of the superior officers.\\xa0 It\\u2019s pretty clear they have enhanced awareness on a lot of fronts.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a hard trap to lay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re good at thinking outside the box,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is doable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe doable.\\xa0 Probably.\\xa0 But

as we talked, she was scanning the surroundings, watching the darker parts of the street.</p>\\n<p>She was <em>itching</em> to go up against this new enemy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy\\u2019s right.\\xa0 It doesn\\u2019t make sense,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Mary shifted position, impatient, annoyed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we let this slide,\\u201d Mary said, halting as the noise in the background reached a crescendo, \\u201cif- I just don\\u2019t want this mission to be stillborn like this.\\xa0 I want a win, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>That,</em>\\u201d I seized on the opportunity, \\u201cIs exactly what we hoped to talk about.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.</p>\\n<p>Mary was paying attention now, even if her eyes didn\\u2019t show it.\\xa0 She was still looking out for trouble.\\xa0 But her hands weren\\u2019t clenched and scrunchy the little lines that tended to appear between her eyebrows and on the bridge of her nose when she was upset weren\\u2019t as pronounced.</p>\\n<p>Even as we stepped out of the way of the streetlight and into darkness, her silhouette had changed in how <em>poised</em> it was.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been coiled like a spring, ready to pounce or react, and now she wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Not as much, anyway.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re being sly, Sy,\\u201d she said, wary but interested.\\xa0 \\u201cGordon too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is more Gordon than me,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I said it because it was true.\\xa0 It <em>was</em> Gordon\\u2019s plan.\\xa0 But also because Mary was more likely to listen to Gordon than to me.</p>\\n<p>She was <em>closer</em> to me, I felt, but she was more likely to listen to Gordon.</p>\\n<p>Gordon cleared his throat.\\xa0 Mary fixed her attention on him.\\xa0 The pair slowed to a stop, and I realized Gordon had a hand on Mary\\u2019s shoulder.\\xa0 He wanted her full attention.</p>\\n<p>I walked a bit forward, the two of them behind me.\\xa0 Taking over Mary\\u2019s watch, so to speak.\\xa0 Looking out for trouble.</p>\\n<p>Behind me, Gordon asked, \\u201cDo you agree with the Brigadier?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy told me you didn\\u2019t have high expectations about how this would turn out, even before we talked to the man.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t feel the killer instinct,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe talked about this after leaving the meeting, but I was thinking about it.\\xa0 They <em>hate </em>us.\\xa0 Their side is angry, they have a cause.\\xa0 This side, I don\\u2019t know how much they really want to fight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m asking,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause if it came down to it, and the Brigadier exited the picture, but we found ourselves in a position to win this battle\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary made a sudden movement, and I turned to get a better\\xa0 look.\\xa0 A hand to her mouth.\\xa0 Connecting the dots.</p>\\n<p>The sound of explosions drowned out the start of Gordon\\u2019s statement.\\xa0 Men came running down the street, a crew of stitched following them.\\xa0 I glanced over them as they passed under the light, looking for the unique facial features of the assassins.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-would you be?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot very,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>There were two ways that could be taken, without context.\\xa0 I wished I\\u2019d heard how Gordon had framed it.</p>\\n<p>But I saw Gordon\\u2019s shoulders relax.\\xa0 His hand dropped from where he\\u2019d been resting it on her shoulder, and the two of them walked to catch up with me a bit.\\xa0 Gordon looked pleased.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt depends, though,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cOn execution.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t it always?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s sound out the others before we start discussing particulars.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor the record,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not entirely on board with this.\\xa0 I see where Gordon\\u2019s coming from, I get it, but I have <em>concerns</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon\\u2019s the reckless one for once?\\u201d Mary observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou should have seen him when he was younger,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe was as bad as I was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon chuckled.\\xa0 \\u201cI wanted to learn the good stuff so <em>very</em> badly, and they wouldn\\u2019t teach it to me.\\xa0 Sy cottoned on and the two of us would take off.\\xa0 Every day.\\xa0 They\\u2019d find new ways to lock us in or station new guards, Sy and I would compete to see who could get out and free the other one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was very aware that our conversation and banter had taken on a lighter tone.\\xa0 It was a contrast to the ongoing fight that we could do so little about.\\xa0 The seriousness of what it was that Gordon wanted to do here.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat Gordon\\u2019s thinking, if he\\u2019s thinking what I\\u2019m thinking he\\u2019s thinking,\\u201d I said, \\u201cIs-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you say thinking one more time I\\u2019m slapping you across the back of the head,\\u201d Gordon warned me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs going to put us in a risky position.\\xa0 We do this right, the Academy will let it slide.\\xa0 But if we pull the \\u2018traitor\\u2019 move and we fail, we\\u2019ll have to off the Brigadier and blame the assassins.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded somberly.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t see in the dark, but I was suspicious that if I could, she\\u2019d be showing me a mischievous grin while maintaining a poker face on the other side, for Gordon\\u2019s benefit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know <em>Sy</em> is joking-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The sentence was cut off as a building detonated.\\xa0 Flame and flying bits of whatever erupted from a rooftop, halfway between us and the wall where the fighting had been happening.</p>\\n<p>Bells were rung, people mobilized.\\xa0 Civilians this time, some in nightclothes.</p>\\n<p>Putting out the fire.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWow,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they keep <em>that</em> up\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey won\\u2019t,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSo far, the Academy\\u2019s been seeing how well they can hold back the enemy with the minimum possible resources.\\xa0 But they won\\u2019t let that go unanswered.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were calls and orders.\\xa0 Permissions given.</p>\\n<p><em>Unleashing the monsters.</em></p>\\n<p>I thought, as Specialists stepped to the fore, joined by the scientists who were looking after the individual projects.\\xa0 Men pulled on chains, hauling experiments out of the enclosures where they had been contained.</p>\\n<p>Three were large, with the massive horns, thick hide, and shaggy fur.\\xa0 Nothing fancy, probably no special qualities.\\xa0 It kind of amazed me when I dwelt on it.\\xa0 Someone had <em>played god</em>, they had made an entirely new life, and they had done it for a grade, halfway through their Academy education.\\xa0 Exercising the fundamentals.</p>\\n<p>Give Lillian two more years and she might just put something like that together.\\xa0 Except she\\u2019d do it different.\\xa0 I would be deeply disappointed in her if she didn\\u2019t learn something meaningful from all of our adventures.</p>\\n<p>The gates swung open, and the creatures charged through.\\xa0 Each one was probably pretty darn close to being bulletproof.</p>\\n<p>We picked up our pace as we moved further away from the site of the explosion.</p>\\n<p><em>Can\\u2019t think straight, this close to it all</em>, I told myself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf this goes badly, it\\u2019s going to cost us,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019ve got Evette the Second in the works.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want them getting second thoughts about moving forward with that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re not going to cancel a project they\\u2019ve already invested into,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn <em>wartime?</em>\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWar is the best excuse ever.\\xa0 Not just for scrapping projects or changing things up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t get me wrong.\\xa0 That guy pisses me off more than any enemy we\\u2019ve gone up against.\\xa0 I\\u2019d love to pull this one off, play it off like we haven\\u2019t in a while, but\\u2026 I have questions, Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor me, specifically?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 Mary, look, since we\\u2019re almost there, you maybe want to handle rounding up the others?\\xa0 With some officers and people in the building, it\\u2019s a bad place to hold this conversation.\\xa0 I need to ask Gordon something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I hated to ask.\\xa0 I knew that Mary didn\\u2019t like being left out.\\xa0 Her isolation had been the tool I\\u2019d used to get her away from Percy.</p>\\n<p>We continued walking, and I felt a little nervous, between Mary\\u2019s silence and Gordon\\u2019s reaction to my earlier concerns.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow long do you need, for your chat?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot long,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to dawdle.\\xa0 But don\\u2019t rush to get everyone out the door either?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I reached out and took her hand, giving it a squeeze.\\xa0 She smiled at me.</p>\\n<p>We reached the house where we were staying, and Mary stepped inside.\\xa0 I gestured, and Gordon and I stepped away from the door, to the corner of the house.\\xa0 We stood under the eaves, streams of water coming down in front of us, like the vertical iron bars of a cell.\\xa0 Our backs were to the wall, and we watched the surroundings.\\xa0 Men were marching in the opposite direction from the gate that was under siege.</p>\\n<p>The city of Westmore was laid out between mountains.\\xa0 It zig-zagged more than it sprawled, and the various exits from the city were all mountain roads and paths, blocked off by sturdy gates much like the one at the front.</p>\\n<p>It somehow made me think of Westmore as being weaker than it was strong.\\xa0 That the Academy had taken it by force only weeks ago suggested that it wasn\\u2019t impregnable.</p>\\n<p><em>Weakness\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFirst thing I gotta ask.\\xa0 It\\u2019s bugging me, and Mary probably knows the answer, but I gotta hear it from you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He heaved out a sigh.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know it\\u2019s a touchy subject, but\\u2026 this morning.\\xa0 You were sitting on the wagon instead of helping out.\\xa0 You can tell me, straight up, if you were hurt in a very normal, conventional way, or lie to me and tell me you were, and I\\u2019ll leave it be.\\xa0 But-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to lie to you, Sy,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I felt my heart plummet.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat happened, exactly?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPhantom pains,\\u201d he told me.\\xa0 \\u201cCouldn\\u2019t coordinate my fingers right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He lifted his hand.\\xa0 He touched his thumb to forefinger, middle finger, ring finger, then pinky, then did it back and forth, faster and faster.</p>\\n<p>I swallowed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s better now,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt was minor, when it happened.\\xa0 But it was a wake-up call.\\xa0 That things can go wrong.\\xa0 That maybe this is the very first step.\\xa0 I start breaking down, things start going wrong.\\xa0 Little things, and only for a short while each time, but the times get longer and the issues get bigger, and eventually, I dunno.\\xa0 I\\u2019m lying in a bed and nothing works or works together, and it all hurts, and the Academy decides it\\u2019s too much trouble to keep the Griffon project alive?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was speaking in an artificially low voice.\\xa0 One that he tried on now and again as his voice steadily and smoothly changed.\\xa0 Burying emotion, doing what he could to control the words and keep them steady.\\xa0 Except at the very end, he was having to try more.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d made it a question.\\xa0 I had the answers.\\xa0 He knew that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could tell you what I know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe projected outcomes.\\xa0 Timelines.\\xa0 But I think you\\u2019d resent me for telling you, after, when the sun was up and things were a little brighter.\\xa0 Because it would cast a shadow over every good day from here on out.\\xa0 You\\u2019d take what I told you and convince yourself it was worse than it was, or something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamn it, Sy,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 His voice was rough, a little choked.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t looking at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes Mary know?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 I had to explain.\\xa0 Gladys, too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cThe others?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian.\\xa0 Not Jamie.\\xa0 Not Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He wouldn\\u2019t have had an opportunity with Jamie and Helen.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t say anything, just thinking.\\xa0 The sound of battle was dying.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t just that we were far away.\\xa0 The bomb blast on the one rooftop and the subsequent release of the warbeasts had ended things.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d forced the Academy to play their hand.\\xa0 The rebellion had spooked the Academy forces of Westmore, and they\\u2019d <em>proved</em> they\\u2019d spooked us.\\xa0 Psychologically, it was what I\\u2019d want to do, if I was leading the enemy.\\xa0 Not that I\\u2019d mount a frontal attack.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey put me together with the best pieces they could get.\\xa0 Augmented, altered, fixed, matched to what I needed.\\xa0 I\\u2019m a chimera.\\xa0 A hodgepodge puzzle of about twenty-six people and some things that weren\\u2019t ever people,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cEverything wired perfectly, with treatments to keep it all in alignment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve had trouble with coordination before.\\xa0 Early on.\\xa0 But the phantom pain\\u2026 I had <em>my</em> hand, but my brain was trying to tell me I had a second, and it was caught in this- this ice cold vise, squeezing, squeezing, squeezing.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t the pain that got me, or that I couldn\\u2019t get my hand to do what I wanted it to.\\xa0 It was\\u2026 I was worried about what it <em>meant.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe second hand?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 His voice had that rough edge to it still.\\xa0 He was having a hard time keeping it steady, but he was managing it.\\xa0 \\u201cSy.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t just work with muscle and bone and the frame of my body.\\xa0 They took a few brains, took them apart, with a few choice pieces in mind, and they jigsawed it all together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re wondering what happens if your brain starts doing what your hand was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know phantom pain and the connections don\\u2019t work that way.\\xa0 But phantom pains like I felt, they\\u2019re a disconnect between the brain and the body in the first place.\\xa0 I just-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He stopped mid-sentence.</p>\\n<p>I gave him time to find the words to speak, or the ability to create the words without letting something emotional slip through.</p>\\n<p>The gunfire had stopped altogether.\\xa0 There was distant shouting, but that probably had more to do with the fallout from the one shell that had hit the roof.</p>\\n<p>I heaved out a sigh.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have anything to worry about just yet,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He raised his voice, \\u201cI told you not-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know I know I know,\\u201d I said, cutting him off.\\xa0 \\u201cI know.\\xa0 But you gotta hear it.\\xa0 And I have to say it.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t have that tearing at you like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cRight.\\xa0 That took longer than I thought it would.\\xa0 You know you can talk to me about it, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you won\\u2019t tell me, if I ask?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you <em>really</em> ask, I\\u2019ll tell.\\xa0 If you need to know, or if it looks like there won\\u2019t be any good days, I\\u2019ll tell.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>I could hear the others inside the house, coming down the stairs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShit,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay, look.\\xa0 Gotta ask.\\xa0 This plan of yours, being entirely honest, how on board with it would you be if we were doing this six months ago?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFray.\\xa0 You were going to go with her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The tension in the air was awful.\\xa0 I honestly felt like he was going to reach out and grab me.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t say a word.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you wanting to do this because a part of you thinks that if it goes horribly wrong, maybe we\\u2019ll all have to pick up and go to Fray?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Silence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr because of the phantom pain?\\xa0 The feeling that you might be breaking down?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI gotta ask.\\xa0 We gotta go into this with our eyes open.\\xa0 No fooling.\\xa0 Knowing that you might cut corners or shift priorities because you feel like you have an \\u2018out\\u2019 in Fray\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou want to know what the box looks like,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot going to lie because I know you\\u2019ll see right through it.\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a bit of a feeling of having an out.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t need the pills anymore.\\xa0 The chemical is everywhere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes-\\u201d he started to say.\\xa0 The front door opened, and Gordon pursed his lips.\\xa0 He gave me a look, as if I\\u2019d timed things specifically to end the conversation there and leave him hanging.</p>\\n<p>Jamie, Helen, Lillian, and Mary all stepped out, wearing raincoats, Jamie with his bookbag.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s coat was a bit too big, swallowing him up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere\\u2019s Gladys?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSound asleep,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThought about it, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-she\\u2019s not a Lamb,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>Gordon bristled at that, but he didn\\u2019t argue.\\xa0 I suspected it had something to do with the fact that he had no idea where I stood, since his confession.\\xa0 Lillian gave me a look, almost <em>inquiring</em>.\\xa0 But she was enough of a Lamb to be included here.</p>\\n<p>We moved as a group, in the opposite direction from the gate.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this about?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re making me nervous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMutiny,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a sharp look.</p>\\n<p>I was too busy watching the others to figure out where things stood.\\xa0 Fear in Lillian\\u2019s eyes, as she looked at each of us, trying to figure out what was going on, or what we were thinking.\\xa0 Jamie looked concerned, and rightly so.\\xa0 Helen gave no sign, of course.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe first foray didn\\u2019t go well?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNope,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe people of the small township of Whitney are angry on a number of levels.\\xa0 They\\u2019re devastated, scared, and armed.\\xa0 The spider thing backfired, without the follow-up attack.\\xa0 They found their courage, they\\u2019re attacking, trying desperately to hurt us before we can do something like that again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf they knew how much work it took,\\u201d Mary muttered.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was watching me carefully.\\xa0 I\\u2019d never told him which direction I was leaning with this plan.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re not going to let up,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s our feeling, given where things stand, that this isn\\u2019t going to end well for the Academy.\\xa0 We\\u2019re the only people who\\u2019ve seen both sides of things.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t have enough anger to drive us to go for the jugular.\\xa0 Brigadier Tylor is a good indication of that.\\xa0 He wants a safe win.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you want <em>mutiny</em>?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were as mad as any of us, after that meeting,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut <em>mutiny</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy\\u2019s choice of words, not mine,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow would you put it?\\u201d Jamie asked, quiet.\\xa0 His first time speaking up since stepping outside.</p>\\n<p>Gordon explained, \\u201cWe disable Tylor.\\xa0 Either we do it and we take over, acting in Tylor\\u2019s place, to give the orders and manage this end of the war ourselves, and we plan to do well enough that he <em>has</em> to keep quiet and take the credit, or we disable him in a way that won\\u2019t raise suspicion, someone else takes charge, and we lean heavily on the new leader to get the results we need.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI feel like if we do this, we\\u2019re going to want to do it fast,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re not going to let up.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll regroup, the people in charge will fan the flames, and they\\u2019ll make another attempt.\\xa0 Before dawn.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have thoughts on that,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cBut let\\u2019s not get distracted.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou three are pretty committed to this?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI have reservations.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.\\xa0 I thought I detected relief.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReservations is putting it lightly,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cAre you <em>nuts?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA little,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is <em>dangerous,\\u201d </em>she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe talked about that part,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not just the sort of thing that screws us up and makes it so they don\\u2019t trust us anymore.\\xa0 It\\u2019s the sort of thing that <em>ends</em> the Lamb project.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe could make a case,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think they\\u2019d let you?\\xa0 I\\u2019ve sat in on meetings where they talked about the Lambs project.\\xa0 They asked for my opinions.\\xa0 How often you were each getting hurt, what your growth looked like, development, promising elements, challenges.\\xa0 I know they were testing me as much as they were evaluating you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re worried this will damage your rep?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThat you won\\u2019t get invited to sit in on meetings?\\xa0 You\\u2019ll lose all of the trust and favors you\\u2019ve bought by helping get this far?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWow,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s unfair.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut it\\u2019s true, isn\\u2019t it?\\xa0 You\\u2019ve earned a kind of status, respect and an ability to dialogue with higher-ups that a lot of people four or five years ahead of you in the Academy haven\\u2019t been able to obtain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian\\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey, I don\\u2019t begrudge you that.\\xa0 I only want to know where your protests are really coming from.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you saying no as an Academy student, or as a Lamb?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p><em>Playing dirty.\\xa0 Sorry Lil.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe two aren\\u2019t- it can be both!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey can be not-both,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, Sy,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m mad, I don\\u2019t like this, but I can\\u2019t do this in good conscience.\\xa0 The risks aren\\u2019t worth it.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.\\xa0 He was already healing from the wounds to his face, but he still looked a little haggard, and despite Lillian\\u2019s ministrations, there were still parts of him which had the drops of resin clinging to him.\\xa0 She\\u2019d cleaned his hair, at least, but the light occasionally caught bits of the glue-like stuff.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou too?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m with Lillian.\\xa0 It feels reckless.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd Helen?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like to find another way to be helpful,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She was healing faster than Jamie, but she also had bits of the resin on her that caught the light.\\xa0 Like tiny raindrops frozen in time.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we tried to take over the Brigadier\\u2019s position, I think I\\u2019d be the least helpful.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want to be useless.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon was frowning.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cQuestion,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we found out a plan that was guaranteed to work, would any of you three change your minds?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI might,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI trust you guys more than I trust myself w-when it comes to some things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I only caught it because of the way he\\u2019d stuttered, but he was cold enough he was shivering.\\xa0 His teeth were chattering.</p>\\n<p>The smoke had taken a lot out of him.\\xa0 Medicine could do a lot, but the body did have to carry its own weight.\\xa0 Sometimes nutrients needed to be supplied, the body needed time to take in the medicines and use the resources the medics or the doctors had so kindly provided.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was frail, and it looked like he was fighting to stay standing.</p>\\n<p>I approached him, coming to stand next to him by the wall, so the side of my body pressed against the side of his.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll break the tie, then,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m defecting to their side.\\xa0 It\\u2019s too hard to do, too risky.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He raised his chin a little.</p>\\n<p>When he looked at me, it felt a little like he was looking a little bit through me.</p>\\n<p>At a certain point, Gordon had stopped being quite the Rebel and had started to fall in line with the Academy\\u2019s expectations.\\xa0 He\\u2019d done marvelously.\\xa0 Now he was returning to the kind of person he\\u2019d once been.\\xa0 A little bit reckless.</p>\\n<p><em>When we\\u2019re babies, we shit ourselves, we struggle to walk, we struggle to communicate.\\xa0 When we\\u2019re old, we shit ourselves, we struggle to walk, we struggle to communicate.</em></p>\\n<p>As things began, so did they end.</p>\\n<p>Did Gordon recognize that?\\xa0 Was he touching base with his roots, as he got his first warning that he was moving toward his conclusion?</p>\\n<p>I almost changed my mind right there.\\xa0 I might have defected a second time, trying to convince the others.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to give him this.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo inside,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cGet some rest.\\xa0 Gordon, you do a walk around the city?\\xa0 Maybe with Mary, if she\\u2019s up to it?\\xa0 I\\u2019ll meet you when you\\u2019re back.\\xa0 Then you and I will do a walk around, then Mary and I.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan I?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t- I mean, I want to help, I don\\u2019t want to be useless or for there to be hard feelings, because I think that it\\u2019s <em>crazy</em> to try and do something to the Brigadier.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, Lillian,\\u201d Gordon murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo with one of the pairs,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut maybe let Gordon and Mary go alone, first?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t need to vent or rant,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThen Lillian can go if she wants.\\xa0 Jamie and Helen hang back, recuperate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie and Helen nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing, then?\\u201d Gordon asked me.</p>\\n<p>I smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeriously.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGoing for a walk,\\u201d I said, walking backward, away from the group.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s suspicious,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, well, that\\u2019s me in a nutshell,\\u201d I said, still smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAm I going to be happy when I find out what you were up to?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cAre <em>we</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou won\\u2019t be <em>unhappy,</em>\\u201d I told him, still walking backward, still giving them my fake smile.</p>\\n<p>There was no response, there were no accusations.\\xa0 I turned, walking into the rain, and I could hear Mary mutter something.\\xa0 Clearly unhappy.\\xa0 We\\u2019d gotten her hopes up.</p>\\n<p>The closer I got to the gate, the more intense the smell of the smoke was.\\xa0 The building had taken a nasty hit, possibly a storehouse, and the fire had burned well enough that I suspected the bomb blast or explosion had been intended to spread fires.</p>\\n<p>Interesting on its own.\\xa0 Fire was a typical countermeasure to stitched.\\xa0 The more they depended on that primal, alligator part of the brain, the less they liked it.\\xa0 Newer stitched were capable of ignoring fire, defaulting to a frozen state or marching headlong into it with no heed for personal harm, which was only a marginal improvement over the fits of rage or panic that it had caused in prior generations.</p>\\n<p>Our enemy had a surprising number of tools that were very effective against us.\\xa0 The warbeasts had likely forced a retreat, suggesting they didn\\u2019t have a countermeasure to <em>that</em>, but something told me that the person in charge of the attack had ordered a retreat the moment the bomb had hit the roof.\\xa0 They\\u2019d bloodied us, they knew we had to retaliate, so they minimized the damage that retaliation could have caused.</p>\\n<p>The warbeasts were loping back toward their pens now, making their way into the gate.\\xa0 I approached the man at the gate, saw him frown.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep out of the way,\\u201d he told me.</p>\\n<p>I raised the badge, and I saw his expression change.\\xa0 Eyebrows up.\\xa0 Lines of what I almost read as <em>disgust</em> on either side of his mouth.\\xa0 Indignation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are four assassins on the periphery of Whitney,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cEach one modified.\\xa0 Any time you open the gates, you need to commit people to searching wagons, checking faces.\\xa0 Even if it slows things down.\\xa0 If they can slip past the walls, the leadership of Westmore is going to be dead within hours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDouble guards on each of the gates, too,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDoesn\\u2019t matter if they\\u2019re hurt.\\xa0 Just so long as their eyes work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gave me a curious stare.\\xa0 I turned and left.</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t the reason I\\u2019d gone back.</p>\\n<p>I retraced my steps, going back, and crossed the street.\\xa0 In the zig-zag of the city, the building was placed at one of the sharp turns, positioned in such a way that it had more space around it.\\xa0 Elbow room.</p>\\n<p>The Brigadier\\u2019s lodge.</p>\\n<p>As I approached the door, two stitched stiffened, hands on their bayonets.</p>\\n<p>I held up my badge again.\\xa0 \\u201cLet me in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>They didn\\u2019t budge.</p>\\n<p>Had he passed on word to the soldiers, but not the stitched?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell Brigadier Tylor there\\u2019s a little boy here to see him,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The stitched took an interminably long time before turning and passing through the door.</p>\\n<p>Almost a minute passed before the door opened again.\\xa0 The stitched took time getting back into position at his post, lips slightly parted, eyes unfocused, before he addressed me again.\\xa0 \\u201cGo in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stepped inside.\\xa0 I took my time removing my raincoat, which made my stomach ache, and bending over to remove my boots, which made it ache more.\\xa0 My coat and boots were half the size of the ones that were already present.</p>\\n<p>Tylor was in the room with several of his superior officers.\\xa0 They were gathered around the table at the far end, opposite his desk, the fireplace off to one side, oil lamps and candles burning throughout.\\xa0 Many of the officers had cigarettes or pipes.\\xa0 The high ceiling kept the room from being too smoky, and because the light didn\\u2019t quite reach the peak, the darkness had a nebulousness to it.\\xa0 Shifting, moving, almost alive.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething of import?\\u201d the Brigadier asked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Not of import.\\xa0 No emergency.\\xa0 But we do need to talk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne minute, then,\\u201d he said, before returning to business.</p>\\n<p>He was crisp in the orders he gave to his men.\\xa0 Who was stationed where, and which weapons to keep at the ready.</p>\\n<p>I walked around to his desk, finger tracing the heavily lacquered wood.</p>\\n<p>Papers, letters, bottles of ink and quill pens, actual metal pens, and stacks of mail.\\xa0 Opened and unopened.\\xa0 He had a nice little letter opener, with a dog engraved into the top of it.</p>\\n<p>My finger touched the handle of the drawers.\\xa0 I knew from earlier that he had a bottle of something in the one.</p>\\n<p>Had we collectively agreed to commit treason, then this would have been the moment I discreetly opened the drawer and dropped something Lillian-provided into the bottle.</p>\\n<p>Instead, I kept circling the desk.</p>\\n<p>There.\\xa0 Half-tucked beneath a stack of papers were envelopes, many with curls of paper peeling off of them.\\xa0 Opened, empty, the contents neatly placed elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>Probably intended for the fire.</p>\\n<p>I took one of his nice pens, one with actual gold inlaid into it and making up the metal parts, the nib excepted.\\xa0 I began penning out short statements on the blank side of each envelope.</p>\\n<p>I lined them up, turning them over.</p>\\n<p>The Brigadier was true to his word.\\xa0 About a minute and a half after he\\u2019d told me to wait, he sent his men away.\\xa0 They pulled their boots and coats on, and the cold outdoor air blew into the lodge as they pulled the door open and stepped outside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcuse me,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>I stepped out of the way, and allowed him to reach his chair, where he promptly set himself down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan I ask what the plan is?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have weapons.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll have at least two warbeasts on guard at any time.\\xa0 If there\\u2019s a problem, we open the gates and set them on the enemy.\\xa0 Artillery emplacements will be moved here and there, mostly to the forward gate.\\xa0 It took a lot of damage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve redecorated my desk,\\u201d he said, noting the envelopes I\\u2019d laid out.\\xa0 \\u201cAm I\\xa0 supposed to keep it this way?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to play a game,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I leaned against the corner of the desk.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA game?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 I could see the struggle of his thoughts on his face as he very briefly considered going off on me for making light of the situation.\\xa0 But he composed himself.\\xa0 \\u201cHow do we play?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a proposal more than anything,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I tapped the envelope nearest to me, \\u201cMy prediction for the enemy\\u2019s next move.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd the other three?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore predictions.\\xa0 The game is simple.\\xa0 If I\\u2019m right, and I turn over an envelope, then you give us more power.\\xa0 More say, more ability to decide how our side fights this war.\\xa0 If I\\u2019m <em>wrong, </em>then we get less power.\\xa0 We do what you say, we don\\u2019t get in your way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded slowly.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat if I said that this isn\\u2019t worth it to me?\\xa0 I could say I stand to gain very little.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s your right, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d he made a sound.\\xa0 \\u201cYou were already right about how tenacious they were.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t feel like a broken enemy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He stood from his seat, looking down at the envelopes.</p>\\n<p>Starting with the leftmost one, closest to me, he turned each one of them over.</p>\\n<p><em>That\\u2019s not how you play my game,</em> I thought.\\xa0 I suspected I was getting a sense of what Mary had felt when we\\u2019d told her we weren\\u2019t focusing on the assassins.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne.\\xa0 They attack before dawn.\\xa0 They leave within the next two hours, time of attack depends on how long the path to the nearest available side gate is.\\xa0 That side gate gets attacked, similar to how the first one was.\\xa0 They either bring out the big guns, they attack two fronts at once, or they utilize a bomb at the gate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo.\\xa0 Just before dawn, we get hit for the third time tonight.\\xa0 Chaos in our ranks.\\xa0 The attack in the previous envelope was a distraction to get one of the assassins into the camp.\\xa0 Superior officers die.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree.\\xa0 The assassin, if not caught, manages a signal to the others.\\xa0 Now that the Westmore forces are looking out for him or her, the assassin only moves in concert with scheduled attacks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe second part of that message is, if the assassin is caught, ahem, because the Lambs are awesome, then the schedule we find on the paper the assassin is carrying is <em>incorrect.\\xa0 </em>They attack by another schedule or means.\\xa0 Repeating steps one and two, to get assassins in place.\\xa0 It is very possible they enter and/or attack using the mine system or any sewer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know Westmore enough to know the particulars there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have a sewer system they could abuse like that,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cWaste runs off into one of the mine systems, where it drops into a steady current underground.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cImpressive,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy has its strengths.\\xa0 They\\u2019re more likely to use a mine shaft.\\xa0 We have enough of them.\\xa0 But they won\\u2019t do this to get their assassins in the first time?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t imagine so,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt would risk tipping their hand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know this how?\\xa0 You studied them that carefully?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.\\xa0 \\u201cAll of that, it\\u2019s what I would do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He turned to the fourth envelope.\\xa0 He tapped his finger on it.\\xa0 Something told me I\\u2019d insulted him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy forces of Westmore that are led by Brigadier Tylor lose,\\u201d he recited, giving me a level stare.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t budge, only meeting his eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were right on the first one,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat gives you one win.\\xa0 If you want something, and it doesn\\u2019t cost me anything, I\\u2019ll grant it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll take measures to react to this attack on the second gate you\\u2019re predicting.\\xa0 That does cost me something, it\\u2019s less men and resources on the forward gate.\\xa0 But I\\u2019ll give you the benefit of a doubt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFirst thing I want that doesn\\u2019t cost you anything, I want to call the rest of the Lambs here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/bleeding-edge-8-2/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>A carriage passed us, the wheels cutting through the golden leaves that had collected at the street\\u2019s edge.\\xa0 The man atop the carriage looked down at us and tipped his hat, smiling.</p>\\n<p><em>Weird.</em></p>\\n<p>I watched as the carriage continued down the long, well-maintained road.\\xa0 The properties on either side were well spaced out, each one less than a proper <em>manor</em>, but more than a mere <em>home</em>.\\xa0\\xa0 Walls both short and tall surrounded each.\\xa0 Stitched in servants\\u2019 uniforms were busy raking up leaves and pruning some peculiar trees with charcoal black bark and autumn-yellow foliage.\\xa0 I wondered if the grass was a similar type of affectation, because it wasn\\u2019t green, but a color comparable to wheat.</p>\\n<p>Peaceful, idyllic, every scene an image from a painting, juxtaposed by the contents of the carriage \\u2013 a large cage with a dozen people and one monster crammed within.\\xa0 A young child gripped the bars with both hands, staring back at me as the beaked monster peered over her shoulder.</p>\\n<p>She let go of the bar, reaching out in my direction.</p>\\n<p>I lifted my hand, as if to take her hand, but she was already ten feet away, the gap growing.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d pulled ahead of the others, so I turned and started walking backward, looking at the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>Our contingent of Lambs were dressed up.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t a huge change for Jamie, who wore a shirt with a straight, stiff-necked collar, a jacket, and slacks, but Gordon had really come into his own with the finer clothes, dressing up in very much the same, but without the jacket.\\xa0 His shirt was tucked in, and a stylized belt buckle drew the eye.\\xa0 Even Hubris was groomed, his short coat brushed until there wasn\\u2019t a stray hair.</p>\\n<p>Lillian, though, had gone the extra mile, with a new dress, navy blue and pleated with a folded collar and a coat stylized after the doctor\\u2019s lab coats, new, fashionable, and nice enough that it could be worn in high society.\\xa0 She had a daub of makeup on her lips and the ends of her hair were curled outward and up.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t <em>her</em>.\\xa0 She was prettier than I\\u2019d ever seen her, unless I counted some mental images of her in a nightgown, lit in just the right way by the light from the window, but I found myself itching to mess up her hair or clothes.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t want to see her <em>upset</em>, but surprised would be nice.\\xa0 Smiling would be better.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure how to reconcile the feeling or how to make it happen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou had a look in your eye.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLies,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou did,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan confirm,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cPerfect recall.\\xa0 In prior moments when you\\u2019ve had that look, you\\u2019ve been up to mischief.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, okay!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I turned around, taking exaggerated steps to the left and then the right, before letting myself crash into Lillian\\u2019s shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cMinor mischief.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian looked at me out of the corner of one eye, wary and getting warier by the second.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look nice,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said as much, just ten minutes ago, when you saw me come through the door,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cAre you saying it again because you want to distract me from what you were really saying or thinking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo paranoid!\\u201d I admonished her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that a yes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a partial yes.\\xa0 The two ideas are linked.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I watched her turn her eyes forward, picking her way through the possibilities.</p>\\n<p>No blush, but I could see the change in her expression as she connected the dots.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBe good,\\u201d she said, suppressing a smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNever,\\u201d I said, reaching down to take her hand.\\xa0 I squeezed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m serious,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t pull her hand away.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is really important to me.\\xa0 If you play around or mess up here, then I\\u2019m going to be really upset.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I swung our hands back and forth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know you want to, Sy.\\xa0 I know how your brain works, as much as anyone can.\\xa0 These people are as important as people can be, without having the power to cancel the Lambs project or call in favors to <em>end</em> us.\\xa0 They are probably the most important and powerful people you can get away with practicing your own Sylvester brand of villainy on, without repercussion.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I started swinging with more and more vigor.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow it sounds like you\\u2019re trying to convince me to do something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo!\\u201d Lillian said, her voice suddenly sharp.\\xa0 She pulled her hand away from mine, letting mine flop to my side, while stabbing a fingernail at my throat.\\xa0 It had been artificially grown or else glued on.\\xa0 Lillian didn\\u2019t normally have longer nails.\\xa0 Sharp.\\xa0 \\u201cNo joking.\\xa0 No turning around thirty minutes from now and saying I convinced you to do it, no nonsense at all, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The more serious and stern she got with me, the more I wanted to do something.\\xa0 Seeing her all prettied up just made me want to tease her more.</p>\\n<p><em>I could kiss her and make her melt, and smudge that makeup that made her look less like our Lillian and more like someone else\\u2019s Lillian.</em></p>\\n<p>It was a nice mental image.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes ma\\u2019am,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I smiled, but it might have looked more like a smirk.</p>\\n<p>Jamie turned to Gordon, pointing at his own eye, \\u201cMischievous glimmer, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI saw it,\\u201d Gordon said, expression flat.</p>\\n<p>Lillian took that as excuse to stab my jugular with her fingernail again.\\xa0 \\u201cBe good, Sy.\\xa0 I <em>want</em> this.\\xa0 One day, I\\u2019m going to have to choose what I <em>do</em> with everything I\\u2019m studying.\\xa0 Professor Ibott wants to attend the nobles and have the most power a non-noble can have.\\xa0 I asked for this job, we didn\\u2019t have to do it, you agreed to do this for me, they did too, but <em>you</em> agreed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m entirely on your side,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t trust you for a hot bloody second, Sy, not when it comes to unfamiliar territory like this.\\xa0 If I\\u2019m ever going to be a black-coated professor, I need friends, contacts, <em>patrons</em>.\\xa0 I need to make friends, and I need to look like I know what I\\u2019m doing.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 Please, please, <em>please</em>, I\\u2019m begging you, don\\u2019t muck this up.\\xa0 <em>Please.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe could have him wait outside,\\u201d Gordon suggested.</p>\\n<p>Lillian snapped her head around to look at Gordon, and I could tell that she was actually pleased at the notion.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to wait outside.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a possibility,\\u201d Lillian said, not acknowledging me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI miss the old days.\\xa0 When I had backup,\\u201d I said, staring out off to one side, at the houses and the trees.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie would have been backing Lillian,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He looked at Jamie, \\u201cSorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s alright,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf it matters, I don\\u2019t think we should leave anyone outside.\\xa0 People like this, they\\u2019re liable to worry about subterfuge.\\xa0 Not being able to watch or keep track of every member of a group of visitors?\\xa0 I think it would put them in a warier mindset.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Did he actually just back me up?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a good point,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere did you pick that up?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA book series I\\u2019ve been reading.\\xa0 Intrigue in noble courts.\\xa0 Not like ours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be good,\\u201d I said, with emphasis.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wish I had something on you,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cSomething you wanted that I could take away, some weakness I could exploit, but you don\\u2019t leave any good openings.\\xa0 It\\u2019s so one-sided.\\xa0 How do I punish you if you ruin this for me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can beat him up, or wrestle him into submission and make him cry uncle and admit he smells like butt, or whatever you want him to say,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m pretty sure you could beat him in a fight.\\xa0 He <em>still </em>can\\u2019t seem to grasp the basics.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFirst of all, not necessary, because I won\\u2019t do anything to deserve a beating, but she tried that this one night this past summer,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI teased her too much and she-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not talking about that,\\u201d Lillian said, louder than was necessary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-tried-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot talking about it!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I dropped the subject.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSilent treatment, then,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p><em>Won\\u2019t work</em>, I thought with confidence, as I saw Lillian glance at me, working through the idea in her head.\\xa0 <em>She\\u2019ll crack before I do.\\xa0 And I can make her break the silence.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll do it too,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cSilent treatment.\\xa0 Solidarity.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>\\u201cHey,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 It\\u2019s like he read my mind and deftly countered my preliminary strategy.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe too,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf it\\u2019s deserved.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can pass on word to the others, too, just in case Sy got the bright idea of joining with the others the next time the teams got shuffled around,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cMary would play along.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe would,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen too, if we bribed her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAshton, well, if Sy <em>really</em> wants conversation, I don\\u2019t think Ashton would really suffice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou boys are the best,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She put her hands on Gordon\\u2019s upper arm, then rose up on her tiptoes to give him a kiss on the cheek.\\xa0 He had to bend down a fair bit to even allow it.\\xa0 Lillian quickly skipped around to Jamie.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t have to bend down or even raise up on tiptoes too much to do it.\\xa0 She beamed a smile as she looked at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be good,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou better,\\u201d she warned.</p>\\n<p>The rest of the way to our destination, she walked between Gordon and Jamie.</p>\\n<p>The properties to our right had given way to a downward slope and a view of a slice of beach and a lake filled with docks and fancy boats.\\xa0 The cart that had passed us earlier was now parked by the water, the door open, occupants and monster gone.</p>\\n<p>The houses to our left grew greater and grander the closer we got to the water.\\xa0 The modifications to each home changed, too.\\xa0 Where the smaller houses were riddled with signs of the cheaper means of building, trees growing into and through them, the bigger houses were more carefully done, the growth and alterations set in the gardens and into the walls.\\xa0 The stone walls had branches and vines creeping through them, covered in bright red berries and thin yellow leaves, crowned with greater clusters of golden yellow foliage at the tops.\\xa0 More conventional, old-fashioned houses in more alien settings.</p>\\n<p>Those leaves would be security measures, I knew.\\xa0 Poisonous to the touch, or covered in tiny fibers that would cause pants-crapping levels of agony for days on end.</p>\\n<p>The house at the road\\u2019s end was the capstone.\\xa0 A true <em>manor, </em>larger than any of the rest.\\xa0 The walls to the left and right of it encased rows of the black-barked, yellow-leafed trees, and the gardens were weird and wiry, more black wood and autumnal colors.\\xa0 The house itself was a sprawl, the wood done dark, the highlights and shingles pale enough they stood out.\\xa0 Stitched waited at the gates.</p>\\n<p>I tugged my shirt into position and straightened my collar as they began opening the gates, lifting and dragging them back and away.</p>\\n<p>Lillian appeared next to me.\\xa0 She looked at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour lead, Lil.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t call me Lil.\\xa0 If <em>they </em>start calling me Lil because you did, I can\\u2019t correct them, and if this somehow works and I get an <em>opportunity</em>, I\\u2019ll have to live with that for a <em>really</em> long time.\\xa0 I know you\\u2019d get the biggest kick out of that, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I raised my hands, putting them over her mouth, cupping them so I didn\\u2019t smudge her lipstick.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She huffed, then nodded.\\xa0 I let the hands drop.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m all agitated now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned to face the gate.\\xa0 People were coming down the long path.\\xa0 I wondered if it was more polite to meet them halfway.\\xa0 Under my breath, I said, \\u201cYour own fault you\\u2019re agitated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo it isn\\u2019t,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She was facing squarely ahead as well, talking out of the corner of her mouth.\\xa0 \\u201cTwo years of experience have led up to this, Sy.\\xa0 Gordon, Jamie, do I look alright?\\xa0 I\\u2019m not all ruffled, or red in the cheeks?\\xa0 Or-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look fine,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look like a proper professor in the making,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t,\\u201d she said, focused on the approaching husband and wife pair.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t look at me.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease don\\u2019t raise me up just to make a bigger crash when you trip me up and I fall.\\xa0 Any other time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSaid the frog to the scorpion, who was asking for a ride across the water,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou too.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t make me nervous,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She let her voice drop off as the pair drew close.</p>\\n<p>I whispered, \\u201cLike I said.\\xa0 Your lead.\\xa0 You get to take point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian gave me the smallest nod.</p>\\n<p>Husband and wife.\\xa0 <em>He</em> was a middle-aged gentleman with obviously altered features, cut a little too sharp.\\xa0 His face was clean shaven, his blond hair waxed to the point that it looked artificial through and through, as if it were finely carved of wood.\\xa0 He wore a jacket with tails and thin slacks, and held a bone cane, more for style than out of any need for one.</p>\\n<p><em>She</em> was a woman who\\u2019d had more work done on her body than most.\\xa0 I might have taken her for his daughter, but she was wearing the open-front blouse that was so common to yesteryear\\u2019s high courts.\\xa0 The cut of the dress bared the space between breasts, and the resulting picture was decorated with low-hanging jewelry and framed with ruffles and lace.\\xa0 It would have been the style for Lillian\\u2019s mother when the woman was Lillian\\u2019s age or a few years older, if Lillian\\u2019s mother was born to a good family.</p>\\n<p>That dress told me a lot.\\xa0 It suggested she was forty, for one, her apparent age cut in half by good care by good doctors.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t unfashionable, but it took courage or <em>reasons</em> to wear it when she could have an easier time following modern fashion trends.\\xa0 The risque styles of dress had been a reaction or signal of support to the Crown around the time the infighting between Crown and Church had started.\\xa0 It was very possible that she or her entire family had a deeper stake in that particular fight, remembered even today.</p>\\n<p>She also had a tic, one finger moving rhythmically where she thought we couldn\\u2019t see, one hand in the other arm\\u2019s sleeve of her.\\xa0 If I remembered right, it was a problem common to people who had had certain augmentations placed within their forearms.\\xa0 A precursor to the same sort of thing that let Fray hide needles in her fingertips.</p>\\n<p>No, even from the way they held themselves, and the ease and care with which they moved, it was clear they were augmented from head to toe.\\xa0 Grafts, physical alterations, drugs, changes to their biological construction at the ground level, and more.</p>\\n<p>They weren\\u2019t nobles, but by golly, they wanted to be.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe so-called Lambs?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI heard stories, I inquired, and what I was told led me to expect monsters dressed up like children.\\xa0 I was skeptical.\\xa0 Now I\\u2019m not sure whether to be disappointed or impressed.\\xa0 Are you the monsters I heard descriptions of, with particularly good craftsmanship?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I bit my tongue rather than make a clever reference to Helen.\\xa0 Three sprung to mind.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re very good at what we do, sir,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cWithout knowing the stories, I\\u2019m afraid I couldn\\u2019t tell you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He looked us over.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery well.\\xa0 This is my wife, Mrs. Adelaide Gage.\\xa0 I am Everard Gage.\\xa0 I am grateful to you for coming.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re happy to render any assistance we can,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would request that the dog stay outside,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, sir, but Hubris stays with me,\\u201d Gordon said, voice firm.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s a member of this team and a resource.\\xa0 May I suggest that I leave and take a walk down by the water?\\xa0 I can wait for the meeting to conclude, without bringing him inside or leaving him behind.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man studied Gordon, looked again at the dog, then shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, both you and him can come in.\\xa0 Follow us, please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We followed the pair as they took the path to the front door.</p>\\n<p>I continued to bite my tongue.\\xa0 <em>Gordon is willing to suggest having me wait outside, but the dog, oh, no, the dog is a member of this team</em>.</p>\\n<p>Heavy double doors of black wood opened with Everard and Adelaide\\u2019s approach, though there were no eyes watching through nearby windows, and the doors themselves lacked openings.\\xa0 I glanced to one side as we passed through.\\xa0 The man in a servant\\u2019s uniform wasn\\u2019t stitched, but something else, lacking eyes, ears and hair.\\xa0 The man on the opposite side was a close match.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn here,\\u201d Everard said, \\u201cThis sitting room gets more light at this time of day.\\xa0 Not that there\\u2019s much to enjoy these days.\\xa0 All overcast gray.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian started to open her mouth, then stopped before voicing anything.</p>\\n<p>I stuck my elbow forward and to one side to push it into her back.</p>\\n<p>Lillian spoke, \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t mind my saying so, sir, it\\u2019s much better than it is in Radham.\\xa0 The rain never stops there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d forgotten about that,\\u201d Adelaide said, speaking for the first time.\\xa0 <em>Even her voice has been altered to be younger and prettier</em>.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been, but it\\u2019s easy to forget it\\u2019s so incessant.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, madam,\\u201d Lillian said, more enthusiastic now that a basic rapport had been established.</p>\\n<p>I would have slapped my hand across my face if I didn\\u2019t think it would get me in trouble with Lillian and the silent treatment from the rest of the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>Lillian continued, \\u201cIt\\u2019s so rare that I can go outdoors without an umbrella or a raincoat that I feel strange without one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The woman offered Lillian a tight smile, chin drawn slightly in, and replied with a simple, \\u201cQuite so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian glanced briefly at me.\\xa0 She hadn\\u2019t missed just how quickly the mood had shifted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould you have a seat?\\u201d Everard asked.\\xa0 He indicated the chairs and loveseat of the little sitting room.</p>\\n<p>We sat.\\xa0 I sat beside Lillian in the loveseat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTea will be along shortly.\\xa0 We called for it as you arrived at the gate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, sir,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He\\u2019d settled in a chair, and hand his hand over the armrest, scratching Hubris\\u2019 head.\\xa0 He looked like a young aristocrat, entirely at home in this environment.</p>\\n<p>Lillian had lost her voice, it seemed, if Gordon was stepping up.\\xa0 I guessed she didn\\u2019t know what she\\u2019d done wrong and she dreaded doing it again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMrs. Gage, <em>ma\\u2019am</em>,\\u201d I said, \\u201cMr. Gage, sir.\\xa0 Can I ask what happened?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe wrote about it all in the letter to your, who was it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMr. Hayle,\\u201d Adelaide said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe man in charge of our project, yes sir, yes ma\\u2019am,\\u201d Lillian said. She\\u2019d picked up on my hint.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat letter should have had the necessary details,\\u201d Everard said.\\xa0 \\u201cAre you so forgetful?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Right on the attack</em>.\\xa0 <em>Defensive</em>.</p>\\n<p>I gestured discreetly with my hand at my knee, watching the eyes of the pair to make sure they weren\\u2019t noticing.\\xa0 At most they might take it to be distracted movements of the hand.\\xa0 <em>Paper.\\xa0 Watch.\\xa0 Hidden.\\xa0 Word.\\xa0 Paper</em>.\\xa0 <em>Strategy</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir, letters get intercepted, particularly those from people of your status,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 I could hear the tremor in her voice partway through the sentence.\\xa0 Not something someone unfamiliar with her would have caught, but a sign that she was anxious.\\xa0 \\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t be unusual to keep details out of the paper that you wouldn\\u2019t want your enemies to catch wind of.\\xa0 But if we\\u2019re going to help, then we\\u2019ll need all of the details.\\xa0 The work we do is dangerous, and a seemingly innocuous detail could get us killed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Good</em>, I gestured.\\xa0 <em>You.</em></p>\\n<p>Everard and Adelaide exchanged a glance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re right,\\u201d Everard admitted.\\xa0 \\u201cWell said.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll be blunt, and admit our second daughter is missing.\\xa0 She\\u2019s run away from home, and she\\u2019s done so in the worst way possible.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA gang of hooligans,\\u201d Adelaide said.\\xa0 \\u201cIn Lugh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAn hour\\u2019s ride away,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cLugh is a blight.\\xa0 A harbor for rebels against the Crown and illegal trade.\\xa0 I can see why it concerns you, sir, her being affiliated with such things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Everard said.\\xa0 \\u201cA blight, I quite like that.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve hired help to go find her and drag her home, but it\\u2019s a hostile place.\\xa0 The Crown comes and stamps at them now and again, but the rats crawl into hiding, and they come out of hiding shortly after the Crown leaves.\\xa0 If they send people to stay and try to defend the city, they find resistance and sabotage every step of the way.\\xa0 We would send more people to recover her, but that would make this less <em>discreet</em>.\\xa0 We wanted <em>quality</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re too kind, sir,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think you\\u2019ll be satisfied.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Not how I would\\u2019ve worded the first half.\\xa0 Would have dropped the \\u2018I think\\u2019 from the second</em>.</p>\\n<p>Adelaide spoke, \\u201cShe\\u2019s altered herself.\\xa0 Threw in with artists and dock workers who tattoo themselves and go to back-alley hacks that alter their bodies.\\xa0 She\\u2019s lost leave of her senses, and now her outside shows it.\\xa0 Horns, altered eyes, tattoos, and who knows what else.\\xa0 All easily remedied, thankfully, but if it\\u2019s linked to us\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She fanned herself with one hand.\\xa0 Her husband reached out to take her other hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll find her,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWithout drawing attention.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood, good,\\u201d Everard said.\\xa0 He paused, then gave Lillian a curious glance.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat <em>are</em> you<em>, </em>then?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lambs are creations, alterations, am I wrong?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, yes sir,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut not me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I leaned forward a little, \\u201cLillian is purely human.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could see the disappointment cross Everard\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe remains one of Radham Academy\\u2019s top students, sir,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s years ahead of her peers, she does errands for Radham\\u2019s professors, handles aspects of various Lambs projects, and assists us as a field medic and, I don\\u2019t want to say she\\u2019s our <em>handler</em>, because we don\\u2019t need explicit handling, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s the human element, ensuring we don\\u2019t diverge into problematic territory,\\u201d Gordon said, very diplomatically.</p>\\n<p>Everard nodded, looking Lillian over.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure Lillian knew what to do with herself, finding herself put on the spot like that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I may, sir?\\u201d Jamie spoke up.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to change the topic.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you may what?\\u201d Everard asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou implied there were details that you didn\\u2019t include in the letter, sir.\\xa0 You included nearly all of what you said here.\\xa0 Is there more?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My memory wasn\\u2019t so bad that I\\u2019d <em>completely</em> forgotten the earlier conversation.\\xa0 I was fairly certain that he hadn\\u2019t implied any such thing.\\xa0 Implications were the sort of thing I paid close attention to.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid I?\\u201d the man asked.\\xa0 Then his expression changed as he realized what the rest of us had, that he\\u2019d verified that he\\u2019d at least <em>thought </em>it.\\xa0 \\u201cYes, there is more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnything and everything you can tell us is helpful, sir,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve heard of these texts that are being shared around?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Oh.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThese hooligans they\\u2019ve befriended, they\\u2019ve got one of them.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve been occupying themselves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s problematic, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt would hardly be of concern, but for the harm it does to the Crown, and the severity of the charges that would be laid against her if she were caught by the full and proper authorities.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026And the implications, with the alterations made to her,\\u201d Everard finished.</p>\\n<p>There was a bit of a pause.</p>\\n<p><em>This keeps getting better</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat alterations, sir?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s immortal,\\u201d Adelaide said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cImmortal, ma\\u2019am?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t know the particulars.\\xa0 The doctor who started her on the regimen left for the war and hasn\\u2019t yet returned, though we\\u2019ve corresponded by mail.\\xa0 Exceptional fellow.\\xa0 He says that the drugs he\\u2019s given her will extend her lifespan indefinitely, and give her some healing ability.\\xa0 If it doesn\\u2019t, or if there are problems, she should last long enough for care to advance to the point of being able to fix it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome experiments have been done that seem to be pointing in that direction, sir, but the level of care required is high,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cImmortality exists, but it\\u2019s paradoxically fragile, enough that even many nobles avoid it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHer doctor thinks he\\u2019s unraveled it, and our daughter was the test subject.\\xa0 We provided the funding.\\xa0 There was and is a massive chance she\\u2019ll die from complications, but the chance to pioneer something like this, we had to take it.\\xa0 Setting her above the rest.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Lillian said, with less enthusiasm than before.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt would be a grave disappointment if she were to figure out the particulars of that work and share it out at a lower cost, until it became <em>common,\\u201d </em>Everard said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019d hoped for her to be special,\\u201d Adelaide said.\\xa0 \\u201cEnough to draw attention.\\xa0 Baron Richmond won\\u2019t be on this end of the Crown States forever.\\xa0 He\\u2019s a bachelor, keeping the company of his twin sisters.\\xa0 We need our daughter back in time to get her cleaned up and presentable, and we need it done with <em>discretion</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnough that the Baron doesn\\u2019t have to hear of it, perhaps?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Everard smiled, \\u201cWe would be grateful.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian tried to speak and fail.\\xa0 She did a fair job of hiding her quiet shock.</p>\\n<p><em>They </em><em>really want to be nobles</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe excel at discretion, sir,\\u201d Gordon said, making brief eye contact with me, as if challenging me to disagree.\\xa0 Or maybe he was thinking of the Brechwell Beast.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery glad to hear it.\\xa0 We can provide rides from here to Lugh and back, should you need it, and anything else you require.\\xa0 Funds, to be sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you.\\xa0 If it\\u2019s alright, we\\u2019ll confer between ourselves and then decide how to move forward?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can do so here,\\u201d Everard said.\\xa0 \\u201cAdelaide and I will see what\\u2019s keeping the tea.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>And confer among yourselves</em>.</p>\\n<p>The two departed the room, gently shutting the door behind them.</p>\\n<p>I gestured quickly, to let the others know we were probably being listened in on.</p>\\n<p>Lillian looked at me.\\xa0 She seemed a little lost.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t even sure she\\u2019d registered what I\\u2019d gestured at her.</p>\\n<p>Then she smiled a little, and leaned across the loveseat to give me a peck on the cheek.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you for the nice things you said,\\u201d she told me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlways,\\u201d I murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cEven if I call you a crybaby, I\\u2019ll have a hundred other nice things to say too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what to do,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to do your job,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to do it well.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll make contacts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut she-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gestured again.\\xa0 Another reminder.</p>\\n<p>She nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll figure out the particulars on the way,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.</p>\\n<p>Then she leaned over and gave me another peck on the cheek.\\xa0 Her hands found my right hand and held it.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d opened up the relationship with a kiss to save her and to save myself.\\xa0 To cast doubt on her word when it came to me.\\xa0 I\\u2019d let her down, in a way, hurt her in the eyes of people she very much wanted to impress.</p>\\n<p>This, I could do this much.\\xa0 I would give her this in compensation.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"//twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/12/17/bleeding-edge-8-4/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>I watched as Lugh came into sight.\\xa0 For a city that seemed to have been named as a hybridization of \\u2018Lug\\u2019 and \\u2018Ugh\\u2019, the sprawl I saw before me seemed fitting enough.\\xa0 It called the shims of Radham to mind, the poor, menial labor focused area of the city, but writ large and dashed across rocky seaside.</p>\\n<p>Half of the buildings were blocky and brutish, pure utility and the cheapest means of building put to use \\u2013 stone blocks and the builder\\u2019s trees, which seemed to have been grown into and through buildings rather than used as the buildings were first put together.\\xa0 Of the other half of the buildings, those that weren\\u2019t made out to be sloping off to one side by optical illusion and the jaunty slant of rooftops were actively working on falling over, with no optical illusion needed.</p>\\n<p>A thick, dark smoke rose from chimneys, a thin spitting of rain came from the clouds above, and the odd occupant of the city had a lantern out or a flickering light on and casting orange light, despite the fact that it was still early in the afternoon.</p>\\n<p>But the capstone, the element of Lugh that made people want to drift close enough to <em>see</em>, should they be on a boat, was the impressive sight of the great superweapon.\\xa0 Or the ex-superweapon.\\xa0 It had died at sea and drifted inland, or it had died at the coast and languished there.\\xa0 Either way, it was too big to really dispose of, so it had been left to rot.\\xa0 The armored exterior and the skin had proven too resilient for even vermin and disease to eat at, and much of it had calcified over the last decade or two, the remainder falling away.\\xa0 As new buildings and sections of dock had gone up, they had done so under, over, and around the tendrils and tentacles that flowed from the armored carapace.\\xa0 Here and there, wood had been grown and brickwork laid to reinforce the structure.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProfessor Ibott\\u2019s mentor created that thing,\\u201d Jamie remarked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReally?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>The waves were heavy in the bay, and the ship rocked this way and that.\\xa0 We were heading for the dock, and it didn\\u2019t feel like we were slowing down enough to avoid crashing bodily into it.\\xa0 I tensed a little and gripped the railing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey made the project a recurring one, they keep a pack of those things in the water, but the batches are smaller.\\xa0 At a certain point, with size, you\\u2019re not getting any more effective, you\\u2019re just showing off,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He smiled.</p>\\n<p>I felt like he was making a joke, and I didn\\u2019t get it.\\xa0 That annoyed me, quite a lot.</p>\\n<p>Was it a short joke?\\xa0 Because I was shorter than most boys my age?\\xa0 Whatever my exact age was?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d he said, looking out at the city.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cS\\u2019alright,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Even after months, there were still bound to be growing pains.\\xa0 I could take a short joke if it meant things would fit together better than they had been.</p>\\n<p>He leaned over the railing, resting his chin on the back of his folded hands.</p>\\n<p>I went still.</p>\\n<p>Bad, complicated memories were springing to the fore.</p>\\n<p>I swallowed hard, and I looked away, watching as the distance between the boat and the dock dwindled.\\xa0 The crew of the ship were rushing back and forth, seeing to duties.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was further down the ship\\u2019s port side, crouched over, her arms around Hubris, talking to the dog while she looked at Lugh through the posts of the ship\\u2019s railing.\\xa0 Gordon was below deck.</p>\\n<p>When he pulled away like that, I knew something was troubling him.\\xa0 He\\u2019d be trying to rest so he could be in the best shape possible when we hit land again.</p>\\n<p>Talking to Jamie was a good thing, from a strategic standpoint.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t just stick to Lillian and pester Gordon and call it a day.\\xa0 Leaving Jamie out and off to one side wouldn\\u2019t breed loyalty or develop the firm bonds, and it would leave me in the dark about him and him in the dark about <em>us</em> when it came to knowing how each of us approached things and thought.</p>\\n<p>It was a good thing, but it was so dang hard sometimes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been quiet on the subject of bringing the runaway girl home,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t have strong feelings one way or the other,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReally?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>He raised his head up, which was a bit of a relief.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReally, really?\\u201d I asked him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 The chin went back down, and he resumed watching the waves break to individual pieces against the rocky outcropping that was the closest thing to Lugh\\u2019s \\u2018beach\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>Leaning forward like that, that position of head and hands, talking while he scanned the surroundings with his eyes, baring a part of himself, even with a singular \\u2018no\\u2019, it was too painfully familiar.</p>\\n<p>I was tougher than this.</p>\\n<p>The <em>real</em> Jamie wouldn\\u2019t want me to be stewing in emotion to the point I couldn\\u2019t function.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not a stitched,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have a brain of your own.\\xa0 We won\\u2019t bite your head off if you voice an opinion.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know that.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve read the books, I\\u2026 cognitively, I understand things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut not-cognitively?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot-cognitively,\\u201d he said, breaking a small smile, \\u201cNot-cognitively, I feel like an impostor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou are,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I saw him flinch.\\xa0 He straightened, stepping back a little from the railing and from me.</p>\\n<p>It dawned on me that the words had actually flowed from my head and out of my mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t what I meant to say,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>He looked away.\\xa0 I could see on his expression that I\\u2019d hurt him.</p>\\n<p>This situation was a parallel to that one in more ways than how the <em>tableau </em>was set out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can remember,\\u201d Jamie said, very slowly, as if he was picking his words out, \\u201cWhat Mary said, back when we first met.\\xa0 I overheard your conversation with Fray, Mauer, and Percy.\\xa0 You confessed your manipulation of Mary, and she said, I quote, \\u2018You\\u2019re really terrible at being honest\\u2019.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure how to respond.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been made into such warped, stunted people, haven\\u2019t we?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 \\u201cFair is foul and foul is fair.\\xa0 I\\u2019m someone that was propped up with memories and knowledge, only to be knocked down and forced to pick up the pieces.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve been twisted around, so that it is the lies you tell that are the most <em>just</em> part of you, and the truths you speak-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre the most unjust?\\u201d I finished for him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot unjust or unfair.\\xa0 But you\\u2019re really unkind when it comes to picking them out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>If he\\u2019d wanted to strike me across the face, it likely would have hurt less.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t really mean to be unkind,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cLike I said, I\\u2019ve read the books <em>he</em> left behind.\\xa0 I know how you operate.\\xa0 I know who and what you are, in nature and personality.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think any less of you, I don\\u2019t blame you, and I don\\u2019t harbor any negative feelings.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI forgive you, Sy,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>He reached for my shoulder, and I pulled back, without meaning to.\\xa0 His hand froze where it was.</p>\\n<p>After a long second, he resumed moving his hand.\\xa0 He gave me two lame pats on the shoulder.</p>\\n<p>I could remember tackling Jamie, the roughhousing, me getting his head under my arm, him getting my head under his arm more frequently.\\xa0 The jabs, no holds barred.</p>\\n<p><em>This</em> Jamie stood arm\\u2019s reach away, withdrawing his hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to go down and let Gordon know we\\u2019ve arrived.\\xa0 We might need to wrangle the indentured workers you purchased.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>He turned to leave.</p>\\n<p>I looked back at Lillian, wondering if she\\u2019d seen, or maybe to look for eye contact, to see someone\\u2019s eyes with warmth in them, familiarity, genuinely happy to see me.</p>\\n<p>Her attention was divided between Hubris and the imminent contact with the dock.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t seem to do anything right when it comes to you,\\u201d I said, to Jamie\\u2019s back.</p>\\n<p>He stopped.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He glanced back at me.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s alright, Sy.\\xa0 I know that feeling very well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Only my white-knuckle grip on the railing kept me from falling over at the unexpected\\xa0 contact with the dock.</p>\\n<p>When I stood straight again, I saw Lillian recovering from the light crash with Hubris\\u2019 help.\\xa0 She stood straight and flashed a smile at me.</p>\\n<p>There it was.\\xa0 That look.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d needed that.</p>\\n<p>I held out a hand.\\xa0 She almost skipped a little as she hurried to take it.</p>\\n<p>Once she had it, I pulled her close.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t let go of my hand until I tugged mine out of the way, so the hug I gave her was a stilted one.</p>\\n<p>Needed that too, if I could admit that much.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that for?\\u201d she asked me.</p>\\n<p>I gave her a quick peck on the lips, then reached up.\\xa0 My fingers mussed up her nicely-done-up hair as I put my hands around her ears.\\xa0 Then I kissed her again, more meaningfully.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d expected one of the sailors on the ship to comment or jeer.\\xa0 What a grave disappointment that was.\\xa0 I could have made her blush.</p>\\n<p>I broke the kiss.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr that?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo I need a reason?\\u201d I asked, moving my hands so she could hear me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou always have a reason, Sy.\\xa0 For everything you do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hubris pushed his head under Lillian\\u2019s hand.\\xa0 She gave him a scratch.</p>\\n<p>Lillian\\u2019s hair was messier now, but she was still dressed nice, one button at her collarbone undone.\\xa0 Her cheeks were flushed, her lipstick ever so slightly smudged, and she looked to be more or less in her element and <em>happy</em>, if only for the moment.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure she\\u2019d ever looked prettier.</p>\\n<p><em>A reason</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>Because you almost make an empty and cold part of me feel full and warm, you make me think it\\u2019s possible to leave old hurt behind and heal this wound, and that has nothing to do with your abilities as a field medic or doctor in training,</em> I thought to myself.\\xa0 <em>Because you\\u2019re genuinely nice to look at and be with.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou wouldn\\u2019t believe me if I told you,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably not,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She shot me a <em>look, </em>serious and accusatory.\\xa0 Then she smiled.\\xa0 She linked her arm with mine.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s get changed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was going to say something about needing to remove all of that lipstick, first.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was going to already, Sy-\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I reached out, put a finger on her chin, and turned her head my way, so I could kiss her again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>There, right there, <em>that</em> was the bright red flush and the flustered look that was all mine to enjoy provoking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot that we actually have time,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd there it is.\\xa0 The let-down after raising me up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Barely</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cCut me <em>some</em> slack.\\xa0 And the mission does come first.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept I\\u2019m dreading this one,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She looked up as a sailor pushed past us, breaking my hold on Lillian.</p>\\n<p>We had to hurry to get out of the way as others were pressing in, wanting to access the cargo belowdecks.\\xa0 I made sure to keep our arms linked so we wouldn\\u2019t be separated again, and the two of us headed back to the corner where the others waited with our luggage.</p>\\n<p>I saw Jamie there.\\xa0 I saw him smile at Lillian and I in greeting.</p>\\n<p>When he\\u2019d said he\\u2019d forgiven me, he\\u2019d meant it.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure how to parse that.\\xa0 But if it meant keeping the peace and working toward something better, I could do my best to simply take and accept that kind of understanding from him, where I\\u2019d never really accepted it from anyone in the past.</p>\\n<p>I was doing that a fair bit these days, trying to make amends by making changes in ways I wasn\\u2019t sure I could explain to the people in question.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The people of Lugh were more heavily modified and tattooed than any group of people I\\u2019d seen in the past.\\xa0 I tried to avoid staring as we passed a collection of six men with roughly identical builds, each with slabs of muscle, hunched-over posture, and arms as thick around as their legs, which were thicker around than I was.\\xa0 Where the next guy could pick up a given maximum weight, these Brunos could carry two of those \\u2018next guys\\u2019 and the weights besides.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I knew the type \\u2013 manual laborers, taking some cheap and freely available option to alter themselves.\\xa0 Radham had one or two that popped up now and again, but for there to be <em>six </em>gathered together, and then more at the docks and some outside the bar down the street, and an eclectic assortment of other types nearby?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It made for very interesting people watching.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cStrategy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow do we handle this?\\xa0 Is it a kidnapping job?\\xa0 Hunt and stalk?\\xa0 Infiltration?\\xa0 Sabotage?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cTh-\\u201d I started.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShut up Sy,\\u201d Gordon said, without malice.\\xa0 I doubted he\\u2019d even been sure I\\u2019d been replying, the way he was walking ahead of the group with Hubris and some of our recruited help.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian\\u2019s answering this one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSomeone woke up grumpy,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gordon, Jamie, Lillian and I had dressed down for our exploration of Lugh.\\xa0 Our clothes weren\\u2019t <em>bad</em>, but they weren\\u2019t nice enough to stand out.\\xa0 Lillian wore boots, stockings, a dress, and a sweater with a run in the wool.\\xa0 Gordon, Jamie and I each had simple slacks in muted colors tucked into our individual boots, simple white shirts, and jackets.\\xa0 Gordon had donned a cap.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUm,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThinking about it, I\\u2019d rather avoid violence.\\xa0 That\\u2019s not in the cards unless we put it in the cards, I think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cDisappointing, but ok.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWho <em>are</em> you?\\u201d one of the adults we\\u2019d recruited asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou haven\\u2019t really explained what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ugh.\\xa0 I wished we hadn\\u2019t had to bring them to get the kids.\\xa0 The kids were at least willing to shut up and listen and see if they couldn\\u2019t figure things out for themselves, instead of looking a gift horse in the mouth.\\xa0 When and if they did ask questions, I was betting they\\u2019d accept the answers they got.\\xa0 Not so for the parents.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019re looking for someone.\\xa0 If we find them, we get paid,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat same pay that let us buy you free of your debt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThere\\u2019s a hint in there, if you listen for it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat are <em>we</em> here for then?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSylvester had a plan for you, but he mostly wanted to be a nice guy and free you,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cLies, balderdash and fuckin\\u2019 bullshit, that last part,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019ll probably use you to gather information, Sylvester will walk you through it,\\u201d Lillian said, sticking her elbow into my ribs.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere you need to go and what you need to listen for, or things you need to say.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll pay for your food and lodging, and when we\\u2019re done we\\u2019ll pay you enough that you can get where you need to be, or at least until you can get by.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHmph,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t sound happy, but that was an out-and-out lie.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t missed the change in his body language the moment Lillian had said \\u2018pay you enough\\u2019.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo violence, then,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUm,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been with us long enough to know how we do things,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to find the target.\\xa0 Girl with horns, not that that\\u2019s going to help-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I could see two different girls with horns nearby, and I\\u2019d seen a handful since we\\u2019d left the harbor behind.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201c-the parents didn\\u2019t give us a name.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey did,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou weren\\u2019t listening.\\xa0 Candida Gage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOh that poor girl,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian, Jamie and Gordon nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOkay, we need to find\\u2026 Candy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI have some ideas about the information gathering, but I don\\u2019t know which one is best,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat do we want, what are we giving?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGiving?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cLet\\u2019s say we put the word out, start asking questions.\\xa0 Someone mentions to another someone that some kids and strangers were asking about whatshername.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCandida,\\u201d Jamie supplied.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat happens next?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe runs,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cLeaves the city, maybe, or makes herself harder to find, if she can\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded with approval.\\xa0 \\u201cQuestion is, can we bait her in, or can we offer something that would make people want to come to us instead of Candida?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSaying her parents were hurt?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 Then before I could shut her down, she shook her head.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d I agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cThe bond isn\\u2019t strong, and they\\u2019ve manipulated her enough she\\u2019s watching for it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cFamily doesn\\u2019t work,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDon\\u2019t go and give her the answer,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou are.\\xa0 You have an answer in mind, and you\\u2019re picking and choosing and subtly pointing the way to that answer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I clapped a hand over my mouth.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI bet you can\\u2019t keep that up for two minutes,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I pointed at him and winked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCan\\u2019t be family.\\xa0 Do we push or do we pull?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cRhetorical question.\\xa0 Thinking out loud.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been spending far too much time around Sylvester,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe\\u2019s going to run if we push, unless it\\u2019s the right kind of push, but I\\u2019m not clever enough to figure out how to do that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I poked her in the arm, hard, my other hand still in place over my mouth.\\xa0 When she looked at me, I wagged my finger at her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re cleverer than you think, Lillian,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded, in a very exaggerated way.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m a year or two older than most of you and I\\u2019m still behind you in terms of my ability to pick things up and put them together,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m years behind a real, practiced doctor.\\xa0 I know I have my strengths, but let me be self-depreciating when it\\u2019s accurate, okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I poked her shoulder again.\\xa0 She swatted at my hand.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe disagree on how accurate it is,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThen let me be self depreciating when I think it\\u2019s accurate, then,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I poked her again.\\xa0 She swatted at me, and I grabbed her hand, my other hand still clasped to my mouth.\\xa0 I held her hand and pressed it to her chest, over her heart.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSy\\u2019s trying to tell you something.\\xa0 Because he just can\\u2019t resist,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t get it,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She tried to pull her hand free and I held on.\\xa0 In a quieter voice, she said, \\u201cAnd you\\u2019re touching my chest, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">That was maybe the fourth most important thing going on here.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Maybe the fifth.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I let her move my hand away, and extended a finger, pointing at her.\\xa0 I had to work against her to extend a single finger and tap it against her chest.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMe,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She shook her head.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I could see her expression changing.\\xa0 The disappointment in herself.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I tapped that finger against her heart again.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSy\\u2019s going to have an aneurysm,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian\\u2019s smile and half-chuckle was more sympathetic for Gordon than anything.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I kicked at his leg.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Clod!\\xa0 Jerk!\\xa0 Look at her, read her!\\xa0 Understand what she\\u2019s doing.\\xa0 She\\u2019s frustrated and you\\u2019re rubbing it in her face.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMe,\\u201d Lillian mused.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat can I do that nobody else can?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I was too busy avoiding Gordon\\u2019s retaliatory kick to give her further guidance.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian continued to voice her thoughts out loud, \\u201cWe know they\\u2019re working on something using the books.\\xa0 What if\\u2026 we tell them the truth?\\xa0 That I know Academy science, I am- <em>was </em>a student of the Academy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon and I turned our full attention to her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey might want help or details, if they\\u2019re working with those books.\\xa0 Or we could tap into that, if we make it clear I\\u2019m looking for one of the books too.\\xa0 Through that, we could find them.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a slim chance, but it\\u2019s-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrilliant,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, ah, ah!\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He smiled triumphantly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEat your dog\\u2019s shit, Gordon,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWow,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope you puke it up and you get that thing where it goes out the nose, too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou amaze me sometimes, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I ignored him, because he was in a prickly, surly mood, and pointed at Lillian.\\xa0 \\u201cGood.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled, but it was a faltering smile.\\xa0 \\u201cYou ended up leading me to the answer you wanted in the end.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI actually was thinking along the lines that you could trade your services for information, at first,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I did jump to the idea you gave, but I was too busy with Gordon kicking me to actively lead you to it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s sweet, Sy,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t believe you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed.</p>\\n<p>I turned and looked back at the two families and the one stray child that were all following us, in earshot, but far enough away to almost count as a distinct group.</p>\\n<p>They looked so confused and lost.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere are we staying?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>Jamie pointed at a building that loomed above the rest.\\xa0 Where there were many buildings here that ranged from the dilapidated to outright shacks, the building Jamie indicated was one of the sturdier ones.</p>\\n<p>I spoke to the families, \\u201cPass on word, ex-Academy student is looking for the <em>book</em>.\\xa0 If they ask what book it is the student is looking for, they aren\\u2019t who we\\u2019re looking for.\\xa0 If you find them, then you get a role in what follows, with a corresponding increase in pay.\\xa0 We meet at that building at dusk if unsuccessful.\\xa0 If successful, you can lead them to us at that building, or just take note of who they are and where they are, we\\u2019ll handle the rest.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw a number of uncertain nods.</p>\\n<p>I had my work cut out for me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStart out by saying you\\u2019re looking for work.\\xa0 Might be you find something for yourselves, which is great.\\xa0 But mention that you have a friend who has Academy training, young and not sure what to do.\\xa0 You can say she\\u2019s heard about a book or say she\\u2019s looking for a mentor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>More uncertain nods.</p>\\n<p>I suspected I could give them a day\\u2019s worth of lessons about how to handle this, and they would still have doubts.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll figure it out,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo in groups,\\u201d Gordon cut in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh yeah.\\xa0 Dangerous town, you\\u2019ll want to be safe,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPairs, trios, or as a family,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cKeep an eye out for trouble.\\xa0 We got you out of a bad situation, if you do decide to head off to greener pastures, maybe do us the favor of letting us know what you\\u2019re doing, so we don\\u2019t waste time looking for you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Less than committal nods.</p>\\n<p>People were so annoying sometimes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The families scattered, staying to their individual family units.\\xa0 One family was black, the other white, and the youngest criminal, independent of either family, immediately went off and ignored Gordon\\u2019s instructions to stay in groups and left on his own.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll stay in groups too,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGreat,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian\\u2019s with me,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I opened my mouth to protest, then closed it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I put you with her, you\\u2019re going to be distracted.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cScurrilous lies,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr you\\u2019re going to distract <em>her</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamn straight,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian swatted my arm.\\xa0 She was so <em>physical</em> like that.\\xa0 I pitied the man who ended up with her, after I was dead and gone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I take you with me, I\\u2019m not sure that pair will have any forward momentum,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>Which was a fine way to say that a pairing of Jamie and Lillian were liable to get their asses kicked.</p>\\n<p><em>But</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>I could see the look on his face.\\xa0 There would be no negotiating, no pleas.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Jamie, my new partner.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight-o,\\u201d I said, after managing to muster up something resembling enthusiasm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay out of trouble,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 Then to Jamie, he said, \\u201cWatch him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll try.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBest I can ask for,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He whistled for Hubris.</p>\\n<p>I watched as he and Lillian walked away.\\xa0 Lillian glanced back at me.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Jamie.</p>\\n<p>It made sense, doing things this way.\\xa0 On a technical level, I knew it was for the best.</p>\\n<p>I was doing a lot of those failed, miserable attempts at convincing myself that things were \\u2018technically for the best\\u2019 too, these days.</p>\\n<p><a

bound to be cold.\\xa0 The people on the beach weren\\u2019t going any further than getting their ankles wet, and even the ones who sat on blankets and wore swimsuits seemed to be using towels and blankets for added warmth.\\xa0 I imagined it was fine so long as there was sunlight, but the wind whipped the gray clouds overhead across the sky and the sunlight was intermittent.</p>\\n<p>I saw Lillian shiver, though she was trying not to show it.\\xa0 I shrugged off my jacket, and draped it over her bare legs, where her skirt didn\\u2019t reach down far enough.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, hugging my knees as we sat together on the slope that led down to the beach.\\xa0 Lillian moved a bit closer and rested her head on my shoulder.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFive minutes,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d she raised up her head.</p>\\n<p>I reached over with my free arm and pulled her head back into position against my shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cFive minutes.\\xa0 Then you should scoot over.\\xa0 I think the Gages are the type that would think less of you if they saw you like this.\\xa0 The twits.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t want a repeat of the incident

and smiled, almost smirking.\\xa0 I shooed at him, and he turned forward again.</p>\\n<p>The profile of face and neck, the hair, the work in the notebook, I <em>recognized</em> that person.\\xa0 Then I remembered that it wasn\\u2019t <em>him</em>, and I felt a pang of loss.\\xa0 My best friend.\\xa0 I missed his talents when things were active and hectic and there was something to be done, and this new Jamie helped bridge the gap.\\xa0 But when things were quiet, I missed<em> him</em>, and the new Jamie hurt rather than help when it came to that.</p>\\n<p>I could see some of the drawing he was doing.\\xa0 Fine lines, wispy, each line assured and careful, more akin to the basic outlining a painter might do in ink before applying watercolor than anything else.\\xa0 A different hand and style than the Jamie I knew.\\xa0 He was drawing the boats, further down, and some of the ships he was drawing had long ago left the harbor.</p>\\n<p>Boats moved this way and that, like one of the puzzles Mr. Hayle had given us back in the day, until certain boats could slip through.</p>\\n<p>I thought of the child in the cage we\\u2019d seen on our way in.\\xa0 Was she already on her way out, aboard a ship?</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t like the idea, and I didn\\u2019t like that acting on it would ruin things for Lil.\\xa0 Unless\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHaving second thoughts?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>Jamie looked up from the drawing.\\xa0 Lillian looked up at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe runaway.\\xa0 It sounds like she had good reasons for leaving home.\\xa0 Being pushed into marriage with a noble?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Baron, no less,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Duke got started early in terms of military strategy and leadership.\\xa0 The Baron?\\xa0 Sixty-four nobles would have to die before he got his shot at the Crown, possibly sixty-five if the Infante of Crown Hispana gets a younger sibling this year.\\xa0 The Baron is closer to the Gages in social rank than to the Duke.\\xa0 Five steps below the Duke, four steps above the Gages.\\xa0 Few opportunities, few reasons to go out and <em>do</em> things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s festered,\\u201d I said, my voice low.\\xa0 \\u201cGone stagnant.\\xa0 Cabin fever, but his life is the cabin.\\xa0 Nothing to do with himself but resent that he can\\u2019t climb higher and turn <em>mean</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie gave me a nod of confirmation.\\xa0 I could see Lillian wince.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to mince words,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCould you?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cReally, about the mincing words thing.\\xa0 I know the Lambs have dilemmas all the time, I know it\\u2019s hard, and you guys make the calls.\\xa0 In Brechwell I made my voice heard, gave my input when I thought you were crossing a line or acting without all the information.\\xa0 But\\u2026 why can\\u2019t this be easy?\\xa0 Can you help me make this easier?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d lifted her head up from my shoulder, and pulled away a bit.\\xa0 She still looked a little cold.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou wanted to be a professor,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t the last tough call you\\u2019re going to have to make.\\xa0 I could lie to you, and take action on my own, and it would take the weight off your shoulders.\\xa0 I could make decisions for you.\\xa0 But I don\\u2019t think doing any of that would be making you the best Lillian you can be.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m fifteen, Sy.\\xa0 These are decisions an adult would have a hard time with.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFifteen is adult.\\xa0 It\\u2019s been adult for a long time, to a lot of people,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFifteen or sixteen is when people have historically gotten married.\\xa0 It\\u2019s when kids have finished school and gone to work, if they didn\\u2019t start sooner.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t let that school of yours convince yourself that childhood somehow lasts until you\\u2019re older.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019m ready.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen let this opportunity slip by,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d say no harm no foul, but it <em>will</em> hurt you.\\xa0 Now, you\\u2019re not competing against any of your peers, because you <em>are</em> stellar and special.\\xa0 But you\\u2019ll end up competing against the students who are eighteen to twenty now.\\xa0 You\\u2019re going to find yourself in much the same position Fray was in when she was considered for a professor\\u2019s position.\\xa0 If those eighteen year olds are making the hard calls now while you\\u2019re holding back, you\\u2019ll fall behind.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt almost sounds like you\\u2019re trying to convince me to go ahead with this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think I would?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Which is why it sounds weird, coming from your lips.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked back and over in the direction of the Gage\\u2019s home to make sure they weren\\u2019t approaching.\\xa0 This would be a bad conversation to have someone overhear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to help the Lambs, Lil.\\xa0 I want to help the people and the experiments who can\\u2019t speak for themselves, the children, the mice among foxes, even those mice who don\\u2019t know what that scratching means.\\xa0 I\\u2019m on the fence about this too, but it\\u2019s because, on one hand, I want to help <em>now</em>, even if it\\u2019s a small thing, helping one person.\\xa0 But on the other hand, I want to help you.\\xa0 Because I think, I <em>hope</em>, that you as a professor will help more people in the long run.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven if that\\u2019s a journey that starts with <em>this?\\xa0 </em>Capturing someone that\\u2019s escaped a bad situation and a\\u2026 horrible family, and sending her back?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s your lead, Lil.\\xa0 This is your mission, first and foremost.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think we should sabotage the job, but it\\u2019s up to you, how hard you really want to try.\\xa0 We could get her back to her family, but do it late.\\xa0 It wouldn\\u2019t reflect so well on the Gages, it wouldn\\u2019t give you the same opportunities, but it would probably rest easier on all of our consciences.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian made a face, scowling at no one thing in particular.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s your call.\\xa0 We back you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep,\\u201d Jamie said, dead sincere.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know I should thank you, but\\u2026\\u201d Lillian trailed off, then sighed.</p>\\n<p>I rubbed her back.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Hubris were making their way down the dirt path that separated the yellow-grass covered slope from the beach.\\xa0 He had one thing of luggage behind him, a smaller case set on top of it, and a third slung over his shoulder, resting against his back.\\xa0 Hubris was strutting with the handle of one luggage case in his jaws.</p>\\n<p>That dope.\\xa0 He was supposed to be walking the dog, not carrying stuff.</p>\\n<p>I might have gotten up to help, but he\\u2019d chosen to take on that particular burden, and I really didn\\u2019t want to.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s approach made me miss the Lambs that weren\\u2019t present.</p>\\n<p>Jamie foremost among them.\\xa0 I looked at the person sitting further down the hill and felt another twinge of recognition, followed by the stab of loss.</p>\\n<p>Having a bad memory sucked, sometimes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan I have a piece of paper?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He opened his book, flipped it over, using a finger to hold his page, and tore out the last page.\\xa0 He had to crawl a couple of feet up the hill and extend his arm, while I had to do much the same, reaching down, before I had the paper.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNeed a pen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve got one, thanks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cScheme?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo scheme.\\xa0 I was going to write Mary a letter.\\xa0 We know where she is, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s at-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me later.\\xa0 I won\\u2019t remember between now and when I address this.\\xa0 Just wanted to get in touch, let her know where we\\u2019re at, what\\u2019s going on.\\xa0 Make it so she doesn\\u2019t feel so alone.\\xa0 Because being with Helen and Ashton, who are good company but not the best for actual <em>conversation</em>, and then there\\u2019s the new guy whatshisname-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDuncan,\\u201d Jamie and Lillian said at the same time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-who doesn\\u2019t have a doctorly name, it\\u2019s gotta be a little isolating,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt probably is,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUnless you don\\u2019t want me to?\\xa0 If it would be weird, me writing a girl a letter, when we\\u2019re sort of, you know-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not writing a <em>girl</em> a letter.\\xa0 You\\u2019re writing <em>Mary</em> a letter.\\xa0 My best friend.\\xa0 Are you honestly telling me that the clever <em>Sylvester </em>is this clueless when it comes to things like this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe clever Sylvester is new to this sort of thing,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s got some of it figured out, but other parts, he just wants to not screw up too badly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s doing fine,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cMostly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMostly?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 I moved the pen over to the other hand, reached up, and tugged at her hair, where it hung in front of her ear.</p>\\n<p>Lillian swatted at my hand.\\xa0 I saw her turn her head, looking for the Gages, then she leaned in and gave me a quick peck on the cheek.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop smiling like that,\\u201d she said, jabbing me with a finger.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not,\\u201d I said, while suppressing a smile.\\xa0 \\u201cI <em>am</em> going to start this letter with \\u2018Dear Mary, Lillian is telling lies and abusing me with pokes and prods.'\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t.\\xa0 You saying that is going to make her miss us more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrue.\\xa0 And we might as well edit it so it\\u2019s fine if someone gets their hands on it.\\xa0 Like the Gages, who we\\u2019ll have to ask to mail it for us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDear Mary.\\xa0 Miss you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s nice,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>Gordon joined us.\\xa0 He settled down a short distance from Jamie, at the foot of the hill, setting down the bags.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey Gordon,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi, Sylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow\\u2019s that heart of yours doing?\\xa0 Pounding?\\xa0 Feeling a twinge?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m fine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause exertion like that, especially dumb, muleheaded exertion, for no reason at all, can\\u2019t imagine it\\u2019s that good for you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m fine, Sy.\\xa0 No pain.\\xa0 Hubris isn\\u2019t telling me there\\u2019s anything he senses that I don\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at the dog.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd what happens if he says it isn\\u2019t, halfway here?\\xa0 Are we supposed to come look for you, or do the Gages find you?\\xa0 Because it reflects badly, you know, and you were being snobby earlier about how we\\u2019re all in this for Lillian and you had her back when I don\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m <em>fine</em>, Sy.\\xa0 I\\u2019m strong.\\xa0 The luggage has wheels.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not a problem.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cRight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe letter,\\u201d Lillian told me.</p>\\n<p>I reached over, and rubbed her thigh through the fabric of my jacket.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnything you want to add, Gordon?\\xa0 Letter to Mary,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell her I\\u2019ll practice.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll land thirty-six out of thirty-nine, next time she gives me lessons.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKnife throwing?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLand\\u2026\\u201d I said speaking very slowly.\\xa0 \\u201cTwenty out of thirty-nine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThirty-six,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight, twenty-six,\\u201d I said, as I wrote down thirty-six.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHubris.\\xa0 Kill him,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Hubris, panting from pulling the luggage, raised his head to look at me, hackles rising, teeth bared.\\xa0 He got to his feet, and he snarled.\\xa0 Lillian moved a little, just beside me, ready to throw herself out of the way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re such a faker, mutt,\\u201d I said, very casually.</p>\\n<p>The hackles went down, he closed his mouth, then flopped over onto his side.</p>\\n<p>I was nearly done the letter when a ship in the harbor blew its horn.\\xa0 I looked up and out and thought again of the kid in the cage.</p>\\n<p>It made me think of the conversation with Lillian, the cost, the gamble.\\xa0 How many small injustices did I have to let slide, to commit a greater justice?</p>\\n<p>I turned my head to look at Lillian, studying her.</p>\\n<p>She was the one who was going to outlive even me.\\xa0 Not that I was going to live that long.</p>\\n<p>Had to do this right.\\xa0 Build her up, make her strong, keep her happy and healthy.</p>\\n<p>Mary was more fragile in some ways, I was worse for Mary, but the damage done would be so short term.\\xa0 Lillian would, extenuating circumstances aside, be an enduring presence in the world.</p>\\n<p>She noticed me looking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 She flushed a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis thing, right here.\\xa0 Whatever we\\u2019re calling this job.\\xa0 You have it in you to do it right.\\xa0 But it\\u2019s going to be tough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI got the gist of that,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She turned to Gordon, \\u201cWe were talking earlier about the moral dilemmas.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s your mission, you make the call,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I gestured toward him.\\xa0 <em>See?\\xa0 See?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor the next part, I\\u2019m going to take lead.\\xa0 Because I think we can find a middle ground, where there is one to be found.\\xa0 I want you to pay attention.\\xa0 Start thinking along these lines.\\xa0 Looking for the less obvious roads.\\xa0 If it\\u2019s the only thing I can teach you, let me teach you this much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She gave me a somber nod.</p>\\n<p>I finished up the letter, keeping to general topics.\\xa0 The content of the letter didn\\u2019t matter \\u2013 it was the fact it was being sent that mattered most, that she was being remembered.</p>\\n<p>We watched the ships for a little longer.\\xa0 Idly, I reached up and tugged her hair again.</p>\\n<p>She licked her lips, glancing back over her shoulder, and jumped a little.</p>\\n<p>I looked.\\xa0 It was the Gages.\\xa0 Everard and Adelaide.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs stood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEverything alright?\\u201d Everard asked.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t get the impression he\\u2019d seen me pull Lillian\\u2019s hair, or that he\\u2019d understood what he\\u2019d seen.\\xa0 No wry look in his eyes, no puzzlement, nothing in his tone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve found a boat.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll go from this harbor to the one in Lugh, sooner than you would if you reached out to your Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Antsy to get us going</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll show you to the appropriate ship.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it\\u2019s no trouble, could you tell us about your daughter while you do?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Everard Gage blinked, a little surprised.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we\\u2019re expected to find her, we should know what we can about her, sir.\\xa0 Age, appearance, name, interests, personality.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see,\\u201d Everard said.\\xa0 He looked faintly uncomfortable.\\xa0 He gestured for us to walk.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs moved down the hill to the luggage, collecting it, before catching up with the others.\\xa0 I saw Lillian heading over to grab the case with her things, and shooed her off.\\xa0 She could go empty handed.</p>\\n<p>I gave it to the mutt, instead.\\xa0 He gave me an annoyed look, but took the handle between his teeth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s a good girl,\\u201d Adelaide said.\\xa0 \\u201cUntil this\\u2026 flight of fancy.\\xa0 She\\u2019s always done well in her lessons, though it took some convincing for some.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich ones, ma\\u2019am?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d have to ask the tutors to remind myself, but there\\u2019s no time for that, is there?\\xa0 There was an instrument she wasn\\u2019t fond of.\\xa0 It might have been the violin,\\u201d Adelaide decided.\\xa0 Then doubt crossed that young woman\\u2019s face.\\xa0 \\u201cOr was that dancing?\\xa0 It was the same teacher.\\xa0 The fellow from Eire.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt might have been the dancing she took issue with,\\u201d Everard said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe wasn\\u2019t graceful.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs there something she particularly enjoyed?\\u201d Gordon tried.\\xa0 \\u201cIn food, drink, treats, entertainment, hobbies?\\xa0 Types of people she spent time with?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw the look on the parents\\u2019 faces, as if they were utterly lost in the face of the simplest questions. If we pushed too much further, we risked offending them.</p>\\n<p>They barely knew their own daughter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould it be better to ask the tutors, then get in touch with us by letter?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPerhaps,\\u201d Everard said.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t a statement that <em>should</em> have ended the line of questioning, but it did.\\xa0 The others had sensed much of what I had, or had taken my cue, because they weren\\u2019t pressing any further.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHer looks?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, she\\u2019s a pretty girl,\\u201d Adelaide said.\\xa0 \\u201cBlonde, but she always wore her hair in that modern style, all curls, tight against the head.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know if she still will, it\\u2019s so much trouble to upkeep.\\xa0 Not a problem at home-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She went on at length about her daughter\\u2019s <em>physical</em> attributes, the particulars of dress, fashion, style, what looked good on her daughter, grace\\u2026 I tuned out much of it.\\xa0 Jamie would remember the key points.</p>\\n<p>The people\\u2019s ramp up to the docks wasn\\u2019t so far away from where we\\u2019d been sitting.\\xa0 We made our way up, our footing swaying as a wagon cart made its way down.</p>\\n<p>The docks weren\\u2019t extensive, but they were nearly as crowded as the harbor was with boats.\\xa0 People were moving things from ship to dock.\\xa0 Construction material.\\xa0 Building homes from scratch was expensive and the materials were so often acquired from elsewhere.\\xa0 When you were going that far, why not go a step further and have the best wood, the nicest marble and stone?</p>\\n<p>I looked over the decks of the ships, searching, studying.</p>\\n<p><em>There.</em></p>\\n<p>The wagon cart, with a cage build into it.\\xa0 The cage was empty, but the crowd of people matched.\\xa0 Young and old, roughly half of them natives of the Crown States.\\xa0 The other half were mixed, some white, some black, some Asian.\\xa0 There were kids and youths in the group.\\xa0 No chains bound them, but from the way they held themselves, the adults in particular, they might as well have had seven stone worth of shackles binding them from neck to wrist to ankle.</p>\\n<p>No, the monster that accompanied them was the shackle.\\xa0 If they tried to run, it would get them, sure as anything.\\xa0 There had probably been a hapless example.\\xa0 Or there would be, when one of them worked up the courage to act.</p>\\n<p>Adelaide was still talking.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t want to pass up the opportunity.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d I murmured, putting a hand on Lillian\\u2019s shoulder, leaning close.\\xa0 I spoke in her ear, just loud enough to be heard by others without being understood, keeping in mind that Adelaide or Everard might have had their hearing improved.\\xa0 \\u201cThat thing I was mentioning earlier, we really should\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Adelaide had trailed off.\\xa0 She glanced back at us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs there a problem?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s minor, ma\\u2019am,\\u201d I said, \\u201cWe would work it out ourselves, but in terms of doing this operation as well as it can be done-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her eyebrows went up, concern, irritation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cClothes, ma\\u2019am,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I pointed at the people on the ship.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re slaves?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIndentured workers,\\u201d she said, archly.</p>\\n<p>Of course.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever you need, let\\u2019s get it over with, the captain is waiting,\\u201d Everard said.</p>\\n<p>Just like that, we were onto the deck of the boat with the slaves.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I may?\\u201d I asked Everard.</p>\\n<p>He gestured at me.\\xa0 I was free to handle this.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCaptain,\\u201d I spoke to the man who gave off the impression he was in charge.\\xa0 He certainly seemed like he was working least and worrying the most.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBoy?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 Then he took note of Everard Gage, and closer look of my clothing.\\xa0 \\u201cHow can I help you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe indentured servants.\\xa0\\xa0 Can I ask what happened?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNonpayment of taxes,\\u201d he said, indicating the natives.\\xa0 \\u201cCrime.\\xa0 Those two families, a question of debts, purchased by the Crown.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWorking off their sentences and debts to the Crown?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d he answered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven the children?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept for that little criminal, yes,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He indicated one boy with pale hair that stood up in every direction.\\xa0 One of the boy\\u2019s arms was shorter than the other.</p>\\n<p>Even the children, institutionalized and made to work to pay off the family debts.\\xa0<em> Sins of the father.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere are they bound?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould be Key Isle,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKey Isle eventually.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you stop in Lugh first?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>I saw him hesitate.</p>\\n<p>It was only a guess, but it was an educated one.\\xa0 I wondered if Lugh was the type of place that bred freedom fighters who would pay top dollar to free people from the Crown and get recruits, or if it was a question of business, offloading assets that ate more food and got more sickly the longer they were on a boat.\\xa0 It would be nice to know, because it would inform how we approached a strange city.</p>\\n<p>I stepped closer to the child that I\\u2019d seen in the back of the wagon.\\xa0 A girl, two or so years younger than me.\\xa0 Maybe older, but shrunken from malnutrition.\\xa0 I was brusque, checking her clothes, touching her hair.\\xa0 She shrank back and I grabbed her firmly.\\xa0 \\u201cStop that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She froze, and looked up at her father, who wore a defeated expression, barely seeming to care about any of this.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this about?\\u201d Everard asked.</p>\\n<p>I leaned close to the girl, holding her hair to my nose.\\xa0 While close, I murmured under my breath, \\u201cSay yes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She wore a puzzled expression as I backed away.\\xa0 She started to speak, and I stuck a finger up, pressing it against her mouth.\\xa0 I looked at the captain.\\xa0 \\u201cHow much?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\xa0 To buy?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 \\u201cDebt for that family is two thousand.\\xa0 That one\\u2019s five thousand, the criminals are working for five years at a dollar a day, if I remember right.\\xa0 Some for ten years, that one and that one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I pulled my finger away, pointing at the girl.\\xa0 I asked her, \\u201cDo you know Lugh?\\xa0 Have you been?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I turned to Everard.\\xa0 \\u201cI want to buy them, sir.\\xa0 Pay their debts and take them on.\\xa0 All of the children of the debtors, the child criminal, and the parents as well.\\xa0 It\\u2019s extra ears on the ground, we can wear their clothes off the boat, so we don\\u2019t draw too much attention.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have the means of disguising yourself already?\\u201d\\xa0 Everard asked.</p>\\n<p><em>Yes, of course we do.</em></p>\\n<p>I grabbed the girl\\u2019s shirtfront, and sniffed it.\\xa0 \\u201cIt smells like the seaside, sir.\\xa0 Sometimes we deal with people who have enhanced senses.\\xa0 Smelling like we <em>belong</em> is critical.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d Everard said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf that\\u2019s what you need to do, then do it.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll see about convincing the captain of the boat you\\u2019re taking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you have the wallet?\\u201d I asked Gordon, gesturing subtly at the same time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, it\\u2019s in one of the bags.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll get it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Everard made a \\u2018tsk\\u2019 sound, then said, \\u201cCaptain, do you know who I am?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir, Mr. Gage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll pay you the next time you\\u2019re in this port.\\xa0 You know I\\u2019m good for my word.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d the Captain said, trying too hard to avoid smiling.\\xa0 He put his hands on the shoulders of different members of the group I\\u2019d pointed out, speaking to his pet monster, murmured orders.\\xa0 Telling it not to act, to let them go.\\xa0 He\\u2019d gotten a grotesquely good deal on this, I suspected.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have the means of controlling them?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll manage,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm hmm,\\u201d he said, in a very \\u2018it\\u2019s your funeral\\u2019 way.</p>\\n<p>Nine people ended up coming, six children and three adults, two men and a woman, roughly half the group black, the other half white.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t see Everard\\u2019s negotiation with the captain, but I did see the captain give the order to move one set of crates off the ship and onto the dock.\\xa0 Making room.</p>\\n<p>I kept quiet and stayed focused, avoiding the puzzled glances of the parents and the children until the ship was underway.\\xa0 Everard Gage and Adelaide Gage stood on the docks, watching us as the crew freed the ship from the dock.\\xa0 There was probably a nautical term for it.\\xa0 Unmoored?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re free,\\u201d I murmured, to the little girl, gripping the ship railing and staring out over the water.\\xa0 Lillian was standing right beside me, Jamie behind me.\\xa0 \\u201cAfter you help us in Lugh, but you\\u2019re free.\\xa0 Debt is paid.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t answer.\\xa0 The ship started moving.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBefore this is done,\\u201d I said to the little girl, \\u201cAfter things settle down and you find a home, you need to learn to fend for yourself, to be clever and be strong.\\xa0 Because whatever your parents did to get into debt that bad, they\\u2019re going to do it again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned my head, meeting her eyes.</p>\\n<p>I saw a resigned look, one that suggested she\\u2019d long since accepted that she was doomed to rise and fall as her parents did.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe next time, you can\\u2019t get caught when they do.\\xa0 You have to be able to manage on your own.\\xa0 Because I\\u2019m betting that one of the stops between Lugh and Key Isle is an Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere isn\\u2019t,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThen they keep you at Key Isle until you know just how miserable existence is there, and then they tell you that you can leave, have your debt cleared, if only you accept doing some work for the Academy.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll test something on you, and you\\u2019ll take that deal.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll wish you hadn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo wait with your family below deck.\\xa0 If there\\u2019s too many of us, the captain is going to get annoyed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded again, then scampered off.</p>\\n<p>I liked her.</p>\\n<p>The ship rose and fell with waves.\\xa0 Hubris\\u2019 claws skittered momentarily on the deck.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas that what happened to you?\\u201d Lillian asked, quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cWith the debt, working for the Academy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t remember if it was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 She took my hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut it could\\u2019ve been what happened,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhich is reason enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

rifles.\\xa0 Each bullet or burst of bullets was an initial crack, followed by an echo that seemed to reach out forever.\\xa0 When a bullet struck dirt that was close enough, it prompted a spray of dirt and dust, touching on those in the trench.</p>\\n<p>More machine gun fire.\\xa0 Hollered words were cut to pieces by the sound of the guns, rendered incoherent.</p>\\n<p>In the trench, Mauer sat with his back to the wall of packed earth.\\xa0 Both of his hands clenched the rifle, the fingernails seemingly too clean, the grit at the edges too dark.\\xa0 The ground was dry, but the air was humid, and the grime and sweat were mingling and gathering minute by minute.\\xa0 If he thought too hard about it, he felt like the grime was so concentrated on his face, neck and hands that it was finding a way to spread beneath his collar and into his sleeves.</p>\\n<p>A day ago he\\u2019d been splattered with blood, and with the water rationing, he hadn\\u2019t been able to wipe it off.\\xa0 He\\u2019d made a mental note of which splatters on his arm were Andrew\\u2019s, a signature, remembering the boy who\\u2019d bartered so enthusiastically for new books and dime novels to read during his downtime.\\xa0 At some point, in all the chaos and the mess, the streaks had dried into a deep, dark brown, joining the dirt and the mud that formed when dust and sweat mingled.\\xa0 Andrew\\u2019s demise had been washed away and overshadowed by everything that had followed.</p>\\n<p>He only had to look at the others who were sitting by the wall to know how he probably looked.\\xa0 Exhaustion and the burden of emotions wore away at the man, and accumulated dirt and blood masked the face and identity.\\xa0 Here and there, there was a pair of eyes that seemed too blue for the dingy palette of their surroundings.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t the people he stared at, as he waited for the dreaded order.\\xa0 That was too much like looking at himself; it forced introspection, and introspection wasn\\u2019t good for the heart or the soul.</p>\\n<p>Instead, oddly enough, he stared at the stitched.\\xa0 Those who weren\\u2019t actively digging or fixing existing trenches were kneeling in the middle of the trench.\\xa0 Most barely moved, they didn\\u2019t flinch, and they didn\\u2019t sweat.\\xa0 The dirt on them was dry.\\xa0 One was caught in an obsessive loop of dismantling a gun, cleaning the pieces, and putting it back together.\\xa0 The handler was holding on to Andrew\\u2019s spare gun, ready to hand it to the stitched in case a situation called for it.</p>\\n<p>The things were oblivious, sad, and not entirely sound.\\xa0 The stitches were ugly, utilitarian, opening up pathways for the wires to sit within, some crossing the face.\\xa0 Two of the things had flesh from multiple people.\\xa0 One of them was put together with a mix of white and black flesh.\\xa0 The others called him \\u2018Bull\\u2019.\\xa0 The second had pieces that might have been from a woman.\\xa0 It was the look of its eye.\\xa0 The lashes were too long, the eye large, the surrounding brow not deep enough.</p>\\n<p>A woman or a child.\\xa0 <em>An innocent eye,</em> he told himself.</p>\\n<p>The machine guns continued their fire.\\xa0 The bullets raked over the top of the trench, causing dirt to spit up at the corners on both sides.\\xa0 Just when he relaxed, an explosion went off about thirty feet away.</p>\\n<p>It was almost what some of the others called a pants-shitter.\\xa0 The sheer impact of some of the shelling, even if it didn\\u2019t touch anyone, could ripple past and through the men, the shock of it loosening muscles that were supposed to keep the shit in.</p>\\n<p>He was lucky he\\u2019d managed to retain his dignity and avoid that thus far.</p>\\n<p>The stitched with the innocent\\u2019s eye stared into space.\\xa0 Mauer stared at the eye, stared past and through it.</p>\\n<p>He couldn\\u2019t say why, but it ate away at him, and yet he couldn\\u2019t keep his eyes away.\\xa0 He inevitably found his gaze wandering back each time he tried.</p>\\n<p>The captain, bent low to the ground, moved along the line.\\xa0 He had two containers of water.\\xa0 He offered one to each person.</p>\\n<p>Mauer wanted more than anything to wash, to feel more human again, but when the captain came, he reached for his own water bottle, giving it a slosh.</p>\\n<p>The captain said something, but it was badly timed.\\xa0 The cracks of guns going off drowned him out.\\xa0 He tried again, \\u201cDrink.\\xa0 Fill yours, just in case.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mauer could see the boys to either side of him flinching at those last three words.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 He took the heavy water bottle from the captain, holding it with both hands, and drank until he felt like he might be sick, then tipped a portion into his own bottle.</p>\\n<p>The captain had a look on his face when he took the bottle back.\\xa0 A deep concern.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d Mauer asked.</p>\\n<p>More bullets touched the edges of the trench.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou here with us?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was more meaning to the question than it initially seemed.\\xa0 There were a hundred hidden comments, ideas, and observations tied to that four-word question.\\xa0 Mauer was almost certain he could have said \\u2018no\\u2019, and his captain would have sent him back, away from the front line.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m here,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p>The man didn\\u2019t argue, but in a very soft voice, as he handed the water bottle to the next man, he said, \\u201cYou look more like one of <em>them</em> than one of us, right now, Mauer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The day was hot, and the heat was worse because some of the guns on the Academy side were venting hot air into the trench, but he still felt a bit of a chill.</p>\\n<p>Mauer had always known that he was better than most when it came to communicating.\\xa0 He had known some people who were similar, in school, working, getting to know others while training to be a soldier, just months ago.\\xa0 The others had had excuses.\\xa0 An abusive father they\\u2019d had to learn to manipulate, heavy pressure from a businessman parent to follow in footsteps.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t like that for Mauer.\\xa0 When he thought seriously about the way people interacted, certain ideas were so clear as to be obvious.\\xa0 \\u2018Us versus them\\u2019 was a pervasive one, defining virtually every interaction across cultural, class, religious, and national lines.\\xa0 One of the ones he\\u2019d grasped very early on.</p>\\n<p>But his captain wasn\\u2019t crouched here in the trench, telling Mauer that he was like one of the men with guns on the other side of no man\\u2019s land.\\xa0 The captain was saying that Mauer was like one of the stitched.</p>\\n<p>How very odd, that in the midst of this, the captain had phrased things in a way that made \\u2018them\\u2019 the stitched.\\xa0 Not the men that were trying to kill them, not the men with brown skin, not the Mexican forces, but the <em>stitched</em>.</p>\\n<p>Mauer nodded slowly.\\xa0 Though the captain had already moved on from his neighbor to the next man, the man was looking over one shoulder, still watching and waiting for a response.</p>\\n<p><em>The stitched are dead.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Dead, but they still walk.</em></p>\\n<p><em>I\\u2019m more like them than like you?</em></p>\\n<p>An exploding shell nearby answered his thoughts.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t flinch as quickly or dramatically as some of the others.</p>\\n<p>Somewhere along the line, when he\\u2019d been too heartsick and tired to care, he\\u2019d started acting a little, to match the others as they\\u2019d cringed and cried out, or swore.\\xa0 Now he wasn\\u2019t sure how much of his reaction was real.</p>\\n<p>His entire body hurt, but nothing had actually touched him yet.\\xa0 No bullet, no explosion.\\xa0 Only dirt.</p>\\n<p>But where the stitched were so hot that it could be uncomfortable to make sustained contact with their skin, he felt very cold in this hot, humid weather.</p>\\n<p>The captain glanced back at him one last time, then relocated, moving over to a little notch in the wall where he could confer with the captain of a squad further down the same long trench.</p>\\n<p>Mauer\\u2019s eyes settled on the stitched with the woman\\u2019s eye.\\xa0 She blinked slowly.</p>\\n<p>As her eye opened, the ground started to rumble.</p>\\n<p>There were shouts of alarm.\\xa0 Mauer was silent as he rose, stepping away from the wall.\\xa0 Sections began to crumble from the edges.\\xa0 Further down, the rumbles made the bottom of one portion of wall give out, crashing into a man\\u2019s lower legs.\\xa0 He was pulled out and out of the way before the unsupported top tipped over to join the rest.</p>\\n<p>The rumble didn\\u2019t stop, but <em>increased</em>.\\xa0 A distant sound joined the rumble.\\xa0 It was too deep, momentous and dull to be the crackling of a fire, but it was a crackling nonetheless.</p>\\n<p>All of it came to a stop, even the sounds of the guns.\\xa0 Mauer\\u2019s ears rang, and he felt dazed as he was pushed aside, the stitched who had been in reserve now hurrying to fix the damage to the wall.\\xa0 A slew of bullets fired, and hit the one in the lead, but it didn\\u2019t even slow down.</p>\\n<p>He made eye contact with the stitched he\\u2019d been staring at, and took an inadvertent step to follow it.</p>\\n<p>Someone grabbed him, held him back.</p>\\n<p>He realized why.\\xa0 Where the wall had collapsed, there was no longer any cover.\\xa0 He might have stepped out and taken a bullet for his trouble.\\xa0 He couldn\\u2019t bring himself to care about the near-death experience.</p>\\n<p>Now that he\\u2019d advanced closer, however, he could see out past the hole.\\xa0 They\\u2019d dug into a gently sloping hill, so they\\u2019d have the benefit of high ground and so that enemy fire would have a harder time reaching them, and now he could look over, out, and down to the distance.\\xa0 The coast.\\xa0 Undrinkable salt water.</p>\\n<p>Two ships.\\xa0 Titanic boats, ungainly in size, loaded down with weapons.\\xa0 They\\u2019d cut deep enough into the beach that it would take a monumental strength to free them.</p>\\n<p>Strength, perhaps, that was provided by the lashing, boneless limbs at the back of each boat.\\xa0 These ships were partially alive.</p>\\n<p>The fronts of the boats moved, yawning open like great metal-plated jaws.\\xa0 From each emerged beasts that must have taken the entire hold.\\xa0 Larger than buildings, taller than the hills that the trenches had been cut into.\\xa0 They were blunt-featured, thick-skinned, with eyes far too small for their great frames.\\xa0 They walked on all fours, not dissimilar to hippos or rhinos in general frame, but had lumpier heads, and chests that were both taller and deeper, possessed of a massive capacity.</p>\\n<p>Far from being Noah\\u2019s ark, this.\\xa0 There were only two beasts to each ark; the one that pushed the boat and the one that was birthed.</p>\\n<p>One beast roared, and it was a nasal, mooing bray that was just as pronounced and vast as the arrival of the boats had been.\\xa0 It made the air shake with the sound, made heartbeats skip with each heavy footfall.</p>\\n<p>Its fellow beast picked up the cry.</p>\\n<p>In answer, the machine guns started again.\\xa0 The time between bursts was shorter, and both the <em>cracks</em> and the bullets had different sounds to them.</p>\\n<p>No longer directed at Mauer\\u2019s regiment.</p>\\n<p>The beasts had moved to a position he couldn\\u2019t see through the gap in the trench wall.\\xa0 He chanced a look beyond.</p>\\n<p>One beast opened its mouth, lowering his head closer to the ground.</p>\\n<p>A red-yellow fog flowed out, the thing\\u2019s chest heaving and pumping as if to drive the gas out.\\xa0 It clung low to the ground, spreading.\\xa0 The chest was pockmarked with little spatters of red, where the massed bullets had bit deep enough into skin to leave tracks, gouges, and punctures.\\xa0 Not enough to stop the thing.</p>\\n<p>The captain walked over, looked out and beyond, following Mauer\\u2019s gaze.\\xa0 The man ducked back behind safety.\\xa0 Mauer remained where he was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ve lost,\\u201d the captain said.</p>\\n<p>Mauer nodded.</p>\\n<p><em>Now</em> the enemy soldiers were the <em>other</em>.</p>\\n<p>Mauer had to step back and out of the way as the stitched started shoveling dirt back up toward the gap in the trench wall.\\xa0 The one with the eye wasn\\u2019t there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot that <em>we\\u2019ve</em> won,\\u201d the captain said, in a conspiratorial tone, not meant for all of the soldiers.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Crown doesn\\u2019t lose wars.\\xa0 When it looks like things are going that way, they force a draw.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The gas was dissipating.\\xa0 The enemy soldiers were still standing, still seemingly alive, gathering their strength.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI saw this a few years ago.\\xa0 Something like it,\\u201d the captain said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis may be where things get harder.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHarder?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat gas, it\\u2019s plague.\\xa0 Parasites, maybe, or a communicable poison.\\xa0 Win or lose, if those brown-skinned S-O-Bs go back home to their families, they\\u2019ll be killing them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A shell went off, a beast flinched, moving its head to one side.\\xa0 The damage seemed remarkably minor, all things considered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey have nothing to lose,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExactly right, soldier.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The enemy was regaining its strength.\\xa0 More shells were going off.\\xa0 Even from this distance away, shouts could be heard.\\xa0 One command, echoed by squadrons of other men.</p>\\n<p>The beasts were so large that almost every shell hit.\\xa0 Every shell <em>hurt</em>, even if the sheer mass of the monsters was so great that it was like taking buckets out of a lake.</p>\\n<p>One particularly well placed shot hit an injured area.\\xa0 The spray of blood that followed was <em>phenomenal</em>, albeit short-lived, blowing a small injury out into a larger one.</p>\\n<p>A command came from far down the trench.\\xa0 Like the enemy had done, captains echoed it.</p>\\n<p>Mauer stared at <em>his</em> captain, waiting.</p>\\n<p>Thirty feet away, the next squadron\\u2019s captain picked up the cry.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGoing over!\\xa0 Target the installations!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mauer\\u2019s captain drew in a breath, then repeated the warning.\\xa0 \\u201cGoing over!\\xa0 Target the installations!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Destroy the artillery to save the beasts.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStitched first!\\u201d the captain ordered.\\xa0 \\u201cUse them for cover.\\xa0 Do not fall behind, or you\\u2019ll stick out!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was so much fear and uncertainty in the trench, now.\\xa0 Murmurs of catching that plague, of being shot.</p>\\n<p>Mauer had heard once that, given a typical arrangement of soldiers, even in a life or death situation, one in twenty would not act to hurt another human being.</p>\\n<p>The thought almost warmed the chill that had settled deep in his chest, fear and anger and frustration bottled deep within.\\xa0 <em>Intrinsic human kindness</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMake sure your rifles are loaded and ready,\\u201d the captain was saying.</p>\\n<p>The reminder helped, but the men needed help in another department altogether.\\xa0 Mauer knew it.</p>\\n<p>The captain had woken Mauer up to something gradual that had been occurring over days and weeks.\\xa0 The gradual, quiet slide toward being a man that was already dead.</p>\\n<p>He couldn\\u2019t go back that way.</p>\\n<p>The only way was forward.</p>\\n<p>He would be forever grateful that he\\u2019d been given that small awakening.\\xa0 Even if his forever only lasted a few minutes more.</p>\\n<p>More shells went off, all directed at the great plague-beasts.\\xa0 Pants-shitters, as the others called them.\\xa0 Mauer had never liked the vile language.</p>\\n<p>He preferred words that had more power.\\xa0 He bent his head.</p>\\n<p>Bowing his head, he spoke.\\xa0 \\u201cI pray to you, Lord God, for protection.\\xa0 You do what is right, so come to our rescue.\\xa0 Listen to our prayers, and keep us safe from harm.\\xa0 Be our mighty rock, the place where we can always run to for shelter.\\xa0 Save us, by your command.</p>\\n<p>He continued, \\u201cYou have made us suffer greatly, but you bring us back from this deep, muddy pit.\\xa0 You give us new life, you make us truly great, and we will strive to take sorrow away.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>When he looked up, he realized many were watching.\\xa0 The stitched with the innocent\\u2019s eye stared, its mouth moving to echo his words.</p>\\n<p>He couldn\\u2019t be sure why that disquieted him so much.</p>\\n<p>When he looked at the captain, the man wore a serious expression.\\xa0 Expressions without words or tone were harder to understand, but he wasn\\u2019t blind.</p>\\n<p>The man gave him a nod.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo!\\u201d came the cry, from the far end of the trench.\\xa0 It was immediately picked up, an echo in different voices.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo!\\u201d Mauer\\u2019s captain cried out.\\xa0 \\u201cOver the top!\\xa0 Stitched first!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The stitched went over.\\xa0 Where the rumbling and shells had weakened trench walls, some broke down a little with the weight of the dead bodies.</p>\\n<p>Mauer watched his stitched go over, urged by the handler, who stayed behind.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t expected to return, or to need another order.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo!\\xa0 Right after them!\\xa0 If you wait, you die!\\u201d the captain bellowed.</p>\\n<p>Mauer went.\\xa0 He watched the stitched he\\u2019d felt such a profound, dangerous\\xa0 connection to.\\xa0 He followed it, gun in both of his hands, and was joined by the other soldiers.\\xa0 The dry ground was just steep enough to make running faster, without making him stumble.</p>\\n<p>Where he\\u2019d been so cold before, there was only a wild, mad fear, and an anger directed more toward <em>them </em>than to the enemy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cClear the trench, press through to the installation!\\u201d the captain bellowed the word.</p>\\n<p>Each step Mauer took was a step away from being a dead man, in the most ironic of ways.\\xa0 There was a passion to his movement, and ideas of what he might do if he survived all this danced through his mind.</p>\\n<p>With a dispassionate expression, he watched the stitched with the innocent\\u2019s eye die.\\xa0 A child or a young woman had gone into its making, he knew.\\xa0 He\\u2019d felt a connection to the thing, and he wasn\\u2019t sure what that connection was, as if there was something he was supposed to put together.</p>\\n<p>Three men died by his hand, and their faces didn\\u2019t even stick in his mind.\\xa0 One rifle shot, two stabs with the bayonet.</p>\\n<p>Another two were injured, cut across their faces, though those faces were already crawling with things the Academies had created.\\xa0 Parasites and leeches.\\xa0 The orange fog had housed other things.\\xa0 Things that hurt and debilitated.\\xa0 The enemy was slow to put up a fight, feeble, but not lacking in conviction in the slightest.\\xa0 An odd combination.</p>\\n<p>What Mauer might have been, if he hadn\\u2019t been woken up.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t hold back, couldn\\u2019t, out of fear that he might never be able to summon up this mad courage again.</p>\\n<p>He made his way across the enemy trench, saw nobody capable of standing or holding a weapon.\\xa0 With shaking hands, he pulled himself up and over the other side, to move toward the artillery installation, reloading the moment he had his two feet on solid ground.</p>\\n<p>The men at the artillery installation had to have known what was evident enough to Mauer and the other members of the squad.\\xa0 It had been a one-sided slaughter.</p>\\n<p>There was no reason, then, for the artillery squad to hold back.\\xa0 The cannon lowered, aiming front and center.</p>\\n<p>Mauer raised his rifle, aimed, and shot in the moment.\\xa0 He watched a man die.</p>\\n<p>The man who manned the artillery cannon, however, survived to pull the trigger, firing toward the front of Mauer\\u2019s squad.</p>\\n<p>Mauer felt his arm go, like a scrap of cloth caught by a strong wind.\\xa0 Blind and nearly deaf, bowels empty, he dropped.\\xa0 It was only when he lay there, yearning for unconsciousness, that he felt the burning across what remained of his skin.</p>\\n<p>He thought of the stitched, and now wondered if it had been real, or if it had been something meant only for him.\\xa0 A <em>sign.</em></p>\\n<p>He screamed, not because of fear or pain or hopelessness, but because he couldn\\u2019t bear to let the flame go out, and a scream of rage and defiance was all he had left to give.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mauer raised the hand the Academy had given him.\\xa0 Rain streamed into and over crevices and cracks.\\xa0 Here and there, muscles twitched, agony lancing through veins, nerves, and around the openings where the fungus -and it was all fungus, despite appearances- broke through the flesh.\\xa0 He likened the experience to having a red-hot needle pulled through his arm every few seconds,</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHow\\u2019s the pain?\\u201d his captain asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt never stops,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 He blew the whistle, managing the location of the Academy\\u2019s beast.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMaybe when we\\u2019re done, it might feel better,\\u201d the captain said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mauer knew the man\\u2019s name, of course.\\xa0 Edwin Gibson, a friend and confidant, but the man would remain his captain in many ways.\\xa0 It was a way of holding on to the fire, keeping from slipping into that dead place.\\xa0 Remembering that day, almost more vivid and clear than real life could be.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll ever be done,\\u201d Mauer admitted.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou chose the right enemy for an endless war,\\u201d the captain said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI chose?\\u201d Mauer asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cPoor wording on my part.\\xa0 I\\u2019m more a man of action than a man of words.\\xa0 A fighting man.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMm hmm,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 He smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve missed you, Ed.\\xa0 It\\u2019s been a lonely year without your company.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI could have visited.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mauer shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cNot worth the risk that others might come to conclusions or start asking questions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI know.\\xa0 Not that it mattered.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUnfortunately not.\\xa0 The Academy is changing.\\xa0 We might have to act sooner than later if we\\u2019re going to avoid being left behind.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve waited too much as is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mauer smiled.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When a few seconds passed, he ventured, \\u201cI\\u2019ve been reminiscent, lately.\\xa0 Do you remember that day?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI do.\\u201d\\xa0 There was no question as to which day it was.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWas it a good day, or a bad one, do you think?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The captain smiled a bit.\\xa0 \\u201cEver with the tough questions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Not an answer unto itself, but perhaps the only answer he\\u2019d give.\\xa0 Mauer was fine with that.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Neither of them were thinking of the last day they <em>fought.\\xa0 </em>That had effectively been the last day of the war.\\xa0 The Crown had given up on the war weeks earlier, the motivation for which was a question of <em>resources</em>.\\xa0 It had been too costly to keep going with Academy productions spread so thin and no thunderstorms for their stitched soldiers.\\xa0 Not the loss of good men and boys.\\xa0 <em>Resources.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mauer and his fellow soldiers hadn\\u2019t been much different from the stitched in that regard.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">No, the day they were thinking about had been the day that Mauer had limped out of the hospital with his new arm, the fire burning fiercer than ever, but with no outlet.\\xa0 Even in fixing him, the Academy had taken their pound of flesh.\\xa0 The arm was one more experiment.\\xa0 They would fix it or replace it as the need arose, he\\u2019d been promised.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He preferred the pain.\\xa0 Better that than to give them more data and help their work.\\xa0 The pain drove him forward, reminded him to keep moving, to focus his talents and focus his mind to figure out all the possibilities.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Even with that, he hadn\\u2019t anticipated the <em>children</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He would know better in the future.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>God doesn\\u2019t back their side</em>, Mauer thought.\\xa0 When he\\u2019d met up with his squadron for what was meant to be one last visit before they went separate ways, those were the words he\\u2019d uttered.\\xa0 A call to arms and an excuse for his own prayer\\u2019s failure, back before they\\u2019d gone over and charged across the empty space.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He\\u2019d said a lot more, after that.\\xa0 They had listened.\\xa0 They had talked, all of them, well into the late hours.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">They had planned.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Those plans were supposed to have come together tonight and tomorrow.\\xa0 He could rally the people to stand against the Academy and see it for what it truly was, and let them fail.\\xa0 Failure could breed other sentiments, if he was careful.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The Academy\\u2019s experiment reacted, jumping back, just barely avoiding crashing into one of the soldiers at the vanguard.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A man, far too large, thick skinned, misshapen and fat, lurked on a nearby building.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gorger.\\xa0 Mauer and his men had done his research.\\xa0 Moles inside the academy had provided the critical details.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mauer felt the heat within him burning quiet and clean.\\xa0 Less a raging flame, and more a white hot steel.\\xa0 He raised his hand to lift the whistle up to his lips and held them tight.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Tell the Academy anything, but don\\u2019t tell them about the whistle, </em>he\\u2019d told the boy.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He\\u2019d given other instructions to others within the Academy.\\xa0 Some he hadn\\u2019t yet had a chance to make use of.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Whistle in place, he grabbed his rifle and tossed it straight up, caught it so his hand was low and in place, and put his thumb through the ring he\\u2019d had installed to work the bolt.\\xa0 He shifted his grip again, raising his Academy-given arm to steady the end of the rifle.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gorger moved off to one side.\\xa0 Too fast for something of his bulk.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But Mauer had anticipated the movement.\\xa0 Gorger had once been human.\\xa0 He thought and operated like a human.\\xa0 He followed the same rules.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The rifle moved in line with Gorger\\u2019s movement.\\xa0 Mauer fired.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He watched Gorger drop.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">That white hot fire and the pain that kept him up nights had forced him to <em>focus</em>.\\xa0 When he couldn\\u2019t sleep at night, he walked to the outskirts of the city and practiced shooting.\\xa0 Always with his rifle.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gorger wasn\\u2019t so different from those great plague-beasts he\\u2019d seen on the last day of the war.\\xa0 Thick skin, but they made the eyes small for a reason.\\xa0 For Gorger, the <em>real</em> eyes were hidden, masked off to the sides.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gorger staggered, one hand to his cheekbone.\\xa0 A bottle of liquid fire splashed against his chest, and the contents sloshed out, flowing off his skin like water off a duck\\u2019s back.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t even singed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mauer blew.\\xa0 The number of short, sharp whistles indicated direction.\\xa0 The spiny beast lunged, sweeping past Gorger.\\xa0 Anything else might have been sliced, but Gorger wasn\\u2019t touched.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAim for the eye!\\xa0 Right cheek!\\u201d the captain shouted.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gorger charged.\\xa0 Mauer redirected the beast, putting it in the monster\\u2019s way.\\xa0 It was lower to the ground, better braced, while Gorger was incredibly strong.\\xa0 Gorger could deal with the beast, but he couldn\\u2019t shield his other eye in the process.\\xa0 He tried another tactic, turning sideways, running with his shoulder forward, driving the monster out of his way and continuing forward.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The squad parted, one soldier a step too slow in getting out of the way.\\xa0 Jean Dupuy, Mauer knew, who\\u2019d hurt his leg in the same explosion that had taken Mauer\\u2019s arm and flesh.\\xa0 Dupuy died, or he was hurt badly enough that only the Academy could put him back together.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mauer whistled, two sharp sounds.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gorger turned, reorienting, looking to see where things were, using his one remaining eye.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The spiny beast attacked him, raking his face and chest.\\xa0 From his reaction, the beast had come close.\\xa0 He nearly stepped on Dupuy as he wrestled with the beast.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The captain\\u2019s turn to whistle, now.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was an odd reflection, in a way, of that day in the war.\\xa0 Except Mauer and his men were on the other side, now.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gorger saw the small, dark objects land in a scattered pile around him.\\xa0 The beast that Mauer had been given sensed the objects while they were still in the air, and it was fast to retreat.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">No less than a dozen grenades went off in quick succession.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This wouldn\\u2019t be it.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t enough to kill Gorger.\\xa0 It <em>was</em> enough to stall it, get them a block or two away.\\xa0 They\\u2019d have another chance to blind, other weaknesses to capitalize on.\\xa0 There would be more obstacles tonight, before they got to safety.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But Mauer wasn\\u2019t concerned.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The battles he fought, be they against Gorger, children, or the Academy itself, weren\\u2019t battles he was supposed to win.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But he\\u2019d seen his death, a dead man walking with an innocent\\u2019s eye.\\xa0 He\\u2019d outlived it, surpassed it.\\xa0 If anything was missing, now that it was gone, he\\u2019d replaced it with a steadily burning rage of the quietest, most patient sort.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was little obstacle he couldn\\u2019t surpass, when he had conquered death.\\xa0 He knew it, his comrades knew it.\\xa0 Others would soon know it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He had faith in that.</p>\\n<p><a

said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t tempt me,\\u201d Mauer said, his voice controlled, sounding for all the world like we were talking over tea.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s focus on the matter at hand.\\xa0 We may need to compromise.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTypically,\\u201d Gordon said, his voice dry, \\u201cA compromise involves both sides getting something, just enough that both walk away unhappy.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not one side threatening to take something away.\\xa0 You\\u2019re looking for a different word.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNegotiate, then,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon spread his hands.\\xa0 \\u201cI assume you\\u2019re threatening to pick off the Lambs one by one until the survivors agree to lead you to safety.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeems reasonable to me,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 \\u201cCounteroffer?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt won\\u2019t work,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou heard us talking to Percy.\\xa0 If you shoot one of us, every last one of us will stare you down while you empty that gun in the rest, one by one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon reached up to fix his hair.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t signal until his hand was at his side again.\\xa0 <em>Scatter</em>.</p>\\n<p>We weren\\u2019t going to stand still if it came down to it.\\xa0 If they killed one of us, the rest of us would make a break for it, and we\\u2019d make their lives hell until the attacking forces wiped us all out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian won\\u2019t stand there and take it,\\u201d I pointed out.\\xa0 \\u201cThe one you\\u2019re aiming at.\\xa0 She\\u2019ll freak, if

of this.\\xa0 She\\u2019s a supporting role.\\xa0 Trust me, Mauer, the only power you have in holding a gun to her head is the power to end <em>us</em> and end the lives of everyone else in the room by proxy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mauer didn\\u2019t waver.</p>\\n<p>Something hit the side of the building, exploding.\\xa0 Not close to the windows we were near, but enough that it made everyone in the room flinch.\\xa0 Mauer retained his composure and balance enough that his aim didn\\u2019t falter.</p>\\n<p>The smoke that billowed from the explosion obscured the rays of light that had been filtering out over the tops of the tables at the windows.\\xa0 The room dimmed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s right,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe gain nothing and lose time by trying this.\\xa0 We have to act, now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mauer didn\\u2019t lower the gun.\\xa0 \\u201cGive them the books and have them lead us to safety, then.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve had your shot, you made promises, and those promises have been broken.\\xa0 If you want to contact me about moving forward with some specific elements of the plan you\\u2019ve been proposing, I\\u2019ll be open to it.\\xa0 For now\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He moved the gun away from Lillian, gesturing toward the window with the barrel.\\xa0 <em>For now, the war.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think it\\u2019s very possible that my

certainly not convinced enough to give up any degree of insurance I might have.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAgreed,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p>I spoke, \\u201cWe lead you out of the battlefield by

confirmed.\\xa0 \\u201cI assume the timing changed in much the way the timing of your arrival was.\\xa0 Without your cooperation, we won\\u2019t know which shots are paving the way and which are a prelude to a barrage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat gets you to the perimeter.\\xa0 Your choice whether you want to move on from there or stay put and hope there\\u2019s a window to go further.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Which there wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 There was a small army beyond the most immediate perimeter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll guide us to North Road Main.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what that is,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut no, we won\\u2019t.\\xa0 The deal is to take you to the perimeter.\\xa0 From there, you\\u2019re on your own.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNorth Road Main is one of three roads that leads out of the city.\\xa0 With the majority of forces coming from the train station to the southwest or the Academy to the northwest, it gives us an easy route out,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe perimeter, no further, in exchange for the books,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd the other requirements I mentioned,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe changes to the books.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>And Percy</em>, Mary had left it unsaid.</p>\\n<p>Bullets struck one of the tables that had been propped up against the window.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t penetrate the thick wood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot good enough,\\u201d Fray said, eyeing the table as it shifted slightly.\\xa0 \\u201cThe North Road.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll also settle for you contacting Catcher.\\xa0 He can provide some assistance.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll write a note.\\xa0 If you lead us to the perimeter, there\\u2019s no guarantee we won\\u2019t find ourselves in the most dangerous, difficult to penetrate area, with you signaling your allied forces to descend on us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t flinch or let my expression drop, even though I wanted to.\\xa0 I could see her assessing me.\\xa0 I\\u2019d considered the notion of luring her into a difficult spot.\\xa0 Halfway because I thought it would work and hand her to the enemy in a tidy little bow, halfway because I wanted to see how she worked to get out of it.</p>\\n<p>Gordon spoke, \\u201cWhen we disarmed the bomb, we disrupted your ability to get to the perimeter.\\xa0 We\\u2019re offering to fix that, in exchange for concessions.\\xa0 Letting you get that far is a pretty big one.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re not that confident in your own plan, for getting to wherever you\\u2019re going, that\\u2019s your own fault.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Good old Gordon, landing the heavy blows.\\xa0 He was such a bother to argue with.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re moving us to a different location in the walls,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow do you expect us to get from one point on the perimeter to the place we want to be?\\xa0 What about time-sensitive elements?\\xa0 No, if you\\u2019re going to make that argument, then we need more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDeal with it,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s our offer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDeliver the note to Catcher and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Fray stood straighter, glancing at Mauer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we should trust them, but I do agree with his point,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you can\\u2019t convince them and convince me they\\u2019re worth listening to, then figure out a way to get us where we need to be to make our way out.\\xa0 If you can\\u2019t do either, then perhaps you can print your books yourself, and worry every step of the way that my forces may <em>inadvertently</em> interfere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fray didn\\u2019t respond to that.\\xa0 Avis, Warren, and the doctor with the cat warbeast returned.\\xa0 It gave Fray a moment to pay attention to them and pay attention to the current situation.</p>\\n<p>Having Gordon on point made sense.\\xa0 When I spoke people immediately started thinking about where the traps and deception were.\\xa0 Gordon portrayed a more trustworthy, straightforward image.</p>\\n<p>Which wasn\\u2019t to say he couldn\\u2019t lie or be clever.</p>\\n<p>That said, I was cringing inwardly.\\xa0 I wanted to give him pointers, to tell him that Fray was in charge and her ego demanded a need for a sense of power.\\xa0 That he could make a small concession and win her over.</p>\\n<p>But Fray, Avis, Warren, Mauer, and Percy were all talking among themselves, in a hushed, hurried way, while watching us very closely.\\xa0 Gestures wouldn\\u2019t go unnoticed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy was right, there\\u2019s a chance we might side with you someday, if we can reconcile what you\\u2019re doing with what we all want,\\u201d Gordon spoke, breaking the silence.\\xa0 \\u201cTaking our offer leaves that door open for the offer to happen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd pushing my point closes it?\\u201d Fray asked.\\xa0 \\u201cA very subtle way of framing an ultimatum.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Also a very subtle way of preying on Fray\\u2019s desire to win people over and have everyone on her side</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t need to tell you you\\u2019re running out of time,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat you did, stirring things into a frenzy, people are going to calm down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Not soon</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s still time,\\u201d Fray said, echoing my thought.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you\\u2019re right, there isn\\u2019t a lot of it.\\xa0 If everyone agrees, we should move.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou actually trust them,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t either,\\u201d Percy said.\\xa0 \\u201cEven if one of them is mine.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry, Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>His eyes met Mary\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>Not quite so harsh as Mary\\u2019s request that Percy be put down, but it did suggest he was stepping away, cutting ties to a similar extent.\\xa0 I had little doubt the apology was genuine, but he\\u2019d made a decision that if it came down to it, he\\u2019d sacrifice Mary to save his own hide.</p>\\n<p>A gulf stood between them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I may,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 She approached Mauer.</p>\\n<p>He tensed as she drew near, then in the moment she took another step, he pointed his pistol against her side.</p>\\n<p>She raised her hands back and out of the way.\\xa0 \\u201cDolores is on the table back there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned my head.\\xa0 The air-breathing octopus-thing was on the table a bit beside me.\\xa0 Helen was poking at it, letting its tentacles coil around her finger in response.</p>\\n<p>Mauer watched Helen and Dolores for a moment.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t speak or move a muscle.</p>\\n<p>Hands still held back out of the way, Fray leaned close.</p>\\n<p>She said something.</p>\\n<p>Seven or eight words.</p>\\n<p>Then she stepped back, slowly lowering her hands, until they were clasped in front of her.</p>\\n<p><em>What\\u2019s she saying?</em></p>\\n<p><em>I want to know what she\\u2019s saying.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did she say?\\u201d Percy asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s sufficient,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy frowned, but he nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d I murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat did she say?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t hear.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWere you listening?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, and I didn\\u2019t hear,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She put on an annoyed expression.</p>\\n<p>Fray approached us.</p>\\n<p><em>What did she say?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cCoordinating an attack on us?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe accept your terms.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon glanced at me, and I nodded.\\xa0 He glanced at Mary, and Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>Gordon indicated the door.\\xa0 Fray stepped away from the group, heading toward the octopus.\\xa0 Helen was faster, snatching it up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot it,\\u201d Helen said. \\u201cI\\u2019ll bring Dolores.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fray didn\\u2019t say anything, apparently content to leave that situation be.</p>\\n<p>As one, we headed out into the hallway.\\xa0 Soldiers were standing at attention on either side of the hall, no longer waiting tensely for things to get underway.\\xa0 Less disciplined than Academy soldiers and cadets might be, they let concern show on their faces.</p>\\n<p>They weren\\u2019t convinced this situation was entirely in control, and they hadn\\u2019t seen any of Fray\\u2019s doubts or the arguing over options.</p>\\n<p>Lillian had taken out her pocket watch.\\xa0 She showed Gordon, who checked, then gestured.</p>\\n<p><em>Good</em>.</p>\\n<p>The second message we\\u2019d written had acknowledged the tight time limit and we\\u2019d left a request to drop additional shots after the fighting started.\\xa0 Things were a <em>touch</em> more chaotic than I had anticipated, however.\\xa0 I was really hoping that things weren\\u2019t so bad that we didn\\u2019t have an escape route, or that the soldiers we were counting on to drop the bombs and provide cover of smoke and dust weren\\u2019t on Fray\\u2019s side, disobeying because they had switched sides.</p>\\n<p>It sounded worse than it was.\\xa0 For them to disobey and effectively sabotage us, they had to be on Fray\\u2019s side and simultaneously aware we weren\\u2019t.\\xa0 The commander who we\\u2019d talked to had sent us to go talk to Dog and Catcher and the other experiments.\\xa0 He\\u2019d heard the horn, and would have drawn the connection to the experiments.</p>\\n<p>To be on Fray\\u2019s side, know we weren\\u2019t, yet be unaware of the fact the horn had helped us?</p>\\n<p>Questionable.</p>\\n<p>That a bomb had obliterated them or the infighting was distracting them too much?</p>\\n<p>Less questionable.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t let my nervousness show.\\xa0 Eyes forward, walk with confidence, pretend everything was going according to plan.</p>\\n<p>There were gaps in this plan, but <em>Fray\\u2019s</em> plan was still intact.\\xa0 She had believed she would have a course she could walk to freedom, with the forces on the perimeter sufficiently occupied.</p>\\n<p>A variant on that plan, how much more dangerous could it be?</p>\\n<p>It was so annoying, being a child.\\xa0 We had soldiers behind us, Warren to the left of us, and to the right and a little in front of us, we had Percy and Mauer.\\xa0 Visibility was limited by the fact that people were taller, and I couldn\\u2019t help but feel surrounded.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t help my growing feeling of anxiety.</p>\\n<p>This would either be marvelous or it would fail marvelously.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe men from the other room?\\u201d Fray asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they aren\\u2019t ready <em>now</em>, then-</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ll be ready.\\xa0 Get them,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p>One of his lieutenants broke away, opening a door.</p>\\n<p>More soldiers filed into the hallway alongside the soldiers at our back.\\xa0 These ones wore uniforms, but they weren\\u2019t the uniforms of the rebellion.</p>\\n<p>Cadet uniforms, military ones.</p>\\n<p><em>To add an element of confusion?\\xa0 Or to achieve a certain goal?</em></p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t matter.</p>\\n<p>We reached the doorway.\\xa0 The final group of soldiers was there, one man crouched by the door.\\xa0 It was cracked open, and he peered outside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe situation?\\u201d Mauer asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia\\u2019s group took drugs,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey started <em>grinning</em>, mad smiles, wide-eyed, veins sticking out on their faces.\\xa0 No combat drug like I\\u2019ve ever seen before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know the one,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cRictus grins, a full body rush.\\xa0 Enhanced strength, reflexes, adrenaline.\\xa0 It also demolishes the mind\\u2019s ability to manage inhibitions.\\xa0 The Academy discontinued it, and it saw use in the black market for a time.\\xa0 People liked how confident and invincible it made them feel.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt shaves off years of your life with every use,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt isn\\u2019t very sustainable to sell on the streets when four or five uses can ruin a thirty year old\\u2019s organs so badly he looks ninety inside.\\xa0 Even the Academy can\\u2019t fix the kind of damage it causes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave her a curious look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know stuff!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe cost in lifespan isn\\u2019t something Cynthia cares about,\\u201d Fray said, looking at our group\\u2019s medic.\\xa0 \\u201cNor was it the reason the Academy stopped using it.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t like the fact that less disciplined soldiers fired at friendlies, and how bad the crime rate became.\\xa0 Cynthia is liable to shoot at <em>us</em> if we cross paths.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHmm,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 When he spoke, it was to the assembled army of sixty-some soldiers, forty in rebellion uniforms and twenty who weren\\u2019t.\\xa0 \\u201cFrom here on out, we shoot at her or her men on sight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were one or two cheers, which drew quiet the moment Mauer shot a sharp look back.</p>\\n<p><em>Not much lost love.</em></p>\\n<p>We waited by the door.</p>\\n<p>Gordon met my eye.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t gesturing, but I got the impression he was trying to communicate something.</p>\\n<p>Something hit, close by, the force of it making Fray and the soldier on watch work to keep the door from flying open.\\xa0 Gordon had taken Lillian\\u2019s pocket watch, and the moment he was done covering his head and ear, he checked it.\\xa0 He shook his head.</p>\\n<p>He met my eyes with purpose.</p>\\n<p><em>What are you doing</em>? I thought.</p>\\n<p>Mary was looking between Gordon and me.\\xa0 Lillian looked terrified, very small while surrounded by opposing forces, shrinking down.\\xa0 Helen stroked the octopus she was carrying as if it were a dog.</p>\\n<p>Gordon didn\\u2019t break eye contact.</p>\\n<p>I looked at the open watch in his hand, checking the time while it was upside down, and then looked back up at him.</p>\\n<p>Not a flicker in his expression.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThrough the door, two by two,\\u201d Mauer was addressing his men.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t press, keep one pace behind the pair in front of you.\\xa0 If you rush, you\\u2019ll get stuck in the doorway or you\\u2019ll start pushing the people in front of you, and you won\\u2019t be following them, you\\u2019ll be directing their movements.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw Warren place a hand on the shoulder of the stitched girl.\\xa0 He pointed at Avis.</p>\\n<p><em>He\\u2019s too big to pass through with someone else</em>, I realized.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll lead the way,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He finally broke eye contact with me.\\xa0 \\u201cListen to my instructions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>An explosion sounded, a mortar shell, very close by.\\xa0 The door was only open a crack, but the smell and taste of smoke and gunpowder in my mouth was enough to gag me.\\xa0 I imagined my spit was a brownish-black.</p>\\n<p>Gordon watched the pocketwatch.\\xa0 Then he closed it.\\xa0 His lips moved slightly.</p>\\n<p>He made eye contact with me again.</p>\\n<p><em>I can\\u2019t read your mind, however you\\u2019d like me to.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She reached back and touched my hand.\\xa0 She smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo codes, no gestures, if you please,\\u201d Fray said, sternly.</p>\\n<p>Code?\\xa0 Gesture?\\xa0 She\\u2019d caught something I hadn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p><em>Not a gesture.\\xa0 </em>In fact, Gordon had been avoiding gestures since the beginning, except when Fray was very clearly occupied.</p>\\n<p><em>Code?</em></p>\\n<p>Before I could reach the end of the train of thought, more shells came down.\\xa0 A trio, blasting into road and sending rock and mud cascading into the air, an earthen geyser.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow!\\u201d Gordon shouted.</p>\\n<p>The door was heaved open.\\xa0 Two by two, we passed through.\\xa0 Fray in the lead with the man who\\u2019d been watching the front door, Gordon and Mary, me and Lillian, Helen with Hubris and the octopus-thing, then Fray\\u2019s group, with Percy and Mauer.</p>\\n<p>The smoke had darkened the sky, the smoke was thick, and I couldn\\u2019t see ten feet in front of me.</p>\\n<p><em>The code.</em></p>\\n<p>In a way, it was like the gestures.\\xa0 Our signs were abstract.\\xa0 We\\u2019d started with the basic directions and six very general signs that encompassed a very wide variety of things.\\xa0 The closed fist for aggression, violence, force, attack, impulse, anger.\\xa0 Then we\\u2019d expanded that, adding new signs, modifying old ones.\\xa0 There\\u2019d been too much need to communicate silently.</p>\\n<p>This was very similar.</p>\\n<p><em>Sy.</em>\\xa0 He\\u2019d been focused on me.\\xa0 Not trying to read my mind or make me read his.</p>\\n<p><em>My mind</em>.\\xa0 My strategy, my way of thinking.</p>\\n<p>A ploy, one he couldn\\u2019t easily share in the midst of things.</p>\\n<p>I exhaled as slowly as I could, as I ran forward, blind.\\xa0 I could extend that trust to him.\\xa0 He\\u2019d done it often enough for me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReverse direction!\\u201d Gordon called out.</p>\\n<p>I stopped before Lillian did, but I\\u2019d been expecting <em>something</em>.\\xa0 My shoe slipped on the cobblestone road, but I caught myself.\\xa0 I tugged Lillian, reached out, and prodded Helen\\u2019s side.\\xa0 Giving her a nudge.</p>\\n<p>The order was called out, passed down the line.</p>\\n<p>We stood in smoke and in the line of fire, while the order for the forward charge was called out, passed down.</p>\\n<p>It took twenty seconds before we were back inside.\\xa0 I was surprised it was even possible.\\xa0 Humans were so naturally disorganized, and even with Mauer\\u2019s warning, I\\u2019d expected a jam.</p>\\n<p>They listened to him like nothing else, it seemed.</p>\\n<p>The door slammed closed as Fray returned inside.\\xa0 The man on watch cracked it open a moment later, peering through.\\xa0 The rest of us knelt or crouched on the floor.\\xa0 More explosions sounded outside.\\xa0 There was a warbeast on the loose on the rooftops, by the sound of it, smaller than the Brechwell Beast, larger than the cat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat the hell was that?\\u201d Mauer asked.\\xa0 \\u201cA <em>test?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t a joking matter.\\xa0 Every second we spend out there is a second we could get shot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you happened to kill us the moment you thought you had a way out, then you would have been stranded,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cNow that we\\u2019ve done that, you know you\\u2019re reliant on us.\\xa0 At least until we get to the perimeter.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Games,</em>\\u201d the doctor with the cat warbeast said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStrategy,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI assume you\\u2019ve given thought to what happens when we actually reach the perimeter?\\xa0 I was working on the assumption that they wouldn\\u2019t have time to waste, or that they wouldn\\u2019t be willing to risk attacking us if we could call for an alert.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYour bag?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian shrugged off the strap for her satchel, then slid it across the floor to Gordon.</p>\\n<p>He opened it, reaching inside, and grabbed a canister.</p>\\n<p>Mauer reached for his gun.\\xa0 Several others did too.</p>\\n<p>Fray reached out, extending a hand, a signal to wait, holding back.</p>\\n<p>It was a grenade, like the ones we\\u2019d used to set fires, back when I\\u2019d set Cynthia on fire, as a matter of fact.\\xa0 A long lever ran down the side, and a pin was jammed in the top.</p>\\n<p>Gordon handed it to Helen, who had to disengage from the octopus.\\xa0 \\u201cHold it tight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.</p>\\n<p>He pulled the pin.\\xa0 Nine out of ten people flinched.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t drop it, unless all is lost, okay?\\xa0 That\\u2019s our insurance.\\xa0 If you loosen your grip on the lever, then we all go up in flame a second or two later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have a good grip,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>I could tell at a glance that a large number of the more important people here, Mauer, Percy, and Avis included, did not like us having insurance to this degree.</p>\\n<p>Gordon opened the pocket watch.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs the next one going to be a ruse too?\\u201d Percy asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll see,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p>The smoke outside was a problem in that it limited visibility and increased the chances of us making a mistake, but it was a problem that had small benefits.\\xa0 Fray couldn\\u2019t look outside to clearly see the damage from her bombs or the troop movements on the roof, and the people up there couldn\\u2019t see us clearly.\\xa0 Fray having people wearing Crown uniforms helped muddy the waters.</p>\\n<p>Fray liked having nine of ten degrees of control, with that tenth part being something she was free to manipulate and control.</p>\\n<p>This didn\\u2019t feel like a nine of ten.\\xa0 A solid two out of ten factors in play were <em>outside</em> factors, the chaos of battle, the fighting atop the rooftops, and an environment I did not feel comfortable navigating.\\xa0 But Gordon\\u2019s trick here had bumped us from a solid five or six to a seven.</p>\\n<p>Seven was fairly comfortable territory.</p>\\n<p>So was our <em>seven </em>running headlong into a wall and dipping into the twos and threes.</p>\\n<p>Gordon looked up.\\xa0 He met <em>Mary\\u2019s</em> eyes, one hand going to his ear, protecting it.</p>\\n<p>Seconds passed.</p>\\n<p>An explosion.\\xa0 Close, but not as close as the last had been.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We were out.\\xa0 Running.</p>\\n<p>This was the one.</p>\\n<p>If I was the indicator he looked to to signal trickery the index and middle finger extended, together, Mary was the straightforward one.\\xa0 The extended thumb with the hand left more open or closed.\\xa0 The thumb didn\\u2019t necessarily indicate the target, but the opposite direction to the target.\\xa0 One of the earlier signs, the execution, the job, the focus.\\xa0 It meant to watch, prioritize.</p>\\n<p>I found myself unconsciously making the sign with my right hand, as I ran blindly through smoke, my other hand on Lillian\\u2019s upper arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop!\\u201d Gordon called.\\xa0 His voice was almost drowned out in the sound of rain, the irregular staccato of gunfire, and the distant roar of the Brechwell Beast.</p>\\n<p>We stopped.</p>\\n<p>My eyes were wide open, and I couldn\\u2019t see much of anything past Fray and the soldier at the front of the line.\\xa0 There was too much smoke and rain, and the vague shapes I did register were impossible to make out at first glance.</p>\\n<p>I realized why Gordon had called the stop and I shut my eyes, turning my head away, my hand losing the gesture to cover my ear.\\xa0 My forehead touched Lillian\\u2019s as I bade her to turn.</p>\\n<p>I really hoped the shock of the hit wouldn\\u2019t cause Helen to drop the incendiary canister.</p>\\n<p>I also really hoped there <em>was</em> a second hit.</p>\\n<p>A bullet struck cobblestone not far from where we stood.\\xa0 I saw the flash of light or a spark as it bounced off.</p>\\n<p>A moment later, as if the bullet had been prophetic, the shell hit ground.</p>\\n<p>We ran through the debris, and I saw Gordon and Mary stumble on the irregular ground, where cobblestone street had been thoroughly shattered.\\xa0 I was more balanced, expecting it, and helped steady Lillian.\\xa0 The ground was particularly hot in one spot I stepped, and I wondered if I\\u2019d burned or melted my shoe.</p>\\n<p>Going from being unable to see through the smoke ten feet ahead of me to having the building there was a shock, as if it was lunging forward at us, rather than the other way around.</p>\\n<p>We passed through the window, Gordon perching in it to help me and Lillian up.\\xa0 I let Lillian go first, looking up at the fighting on the roof.\\xa0 Discrete groups, shouts, ongoing fighting, and a ape-like Warbeast standing between two groups, threatening both.</p>\\n<p>We really weren\\u2019t on their radar.</p>\\n<p>I took Gordon\\u2019s hand, and he hauled me inside.</p>\\n<p>Fray\\u2019s group, Mauer, and Percy made their way inside.\\xa0 The soldiers gathered with their backs to the wall.\\xa0 There wasn\\u2019t enough room immediately inside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll take that,\\u201d Fray said, to Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAw.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fray took the octopus.\\xa0 It crawled up to her shoulder and wrapped itself loosely around her neck like a scarf.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe books,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Fray looked at the stitched girl.\\xa0 \\u201cI suppose it\\u2019s time.\\xa0 Give the books back, Wendy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wendy approached.\\xa0 She handed me the backpack.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs to the other part of our deal,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this?\\u201d Mauer asked.</p>\\n<p>Fray set her eyes on Percy.</p>\\n<p>Boots tramped on the floor above us.\\xa0 Everyone looked, worrying we were about to face soldiers.\\xa0 A gun fired, a body fell.</p>\\n<p>More boots stomped on floorboards.\\xa0 Nobody came downstairs.</p>\\n<p>Mary was staring at Percy, her jaw set.</p>\\n<p><em>The other part of the deal</em>.</p>\\n<p>It would be an advantage, a win for the Academy, for us, a hit to the enemy, a benefit to <em>Mary</em> in a way, even.</p>\\n<p>All I had to do was let the lie to Mary continue.</p>\\n<p>Less than an hour ago, Lillian had suggested I was like an abusive husband.\\xa0 Manipulating, coddling, baiting people closer and then pushing them away.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure if this was bait or a push.</p>\\n<p>My finger touched the ring at my thumb.\\xa0 There was a faint \\u2018x\\u2019 on the knuckle.\\xa0 I\\u2019d written it to remind myself of something.\\xa0 Damn it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s awkward to admit, and I know this will cause friction,\\u201d Fray said, \\u201cBut-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Right, had to focus on the matter at hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Fray stopped short.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs looked at me.</p>\\n<p>My breath was frozen in my throat.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t bring myself to breathe, let alone speak.</p>\\n<p>But\\u2026</p>\\n<p>When I swallowed, it was a difficult swallow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI lied to you, Mary,\\u201d I said, my voice soft.\\xa0 I stared down Percy.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout Percy.\\xa0 There was no command phrase, he didn\\u2019t abandon you, he <em>did</em> intend you to lead.\\xa0 When he confessed his sins to you earlier, he was lying too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary stared at me, then looked at Percy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe cares, Mary.\\xa0 I know we might lose you by me admitting it, but- he cares enough to let you hate him, if it means you\\u2019re happier in the end, with us.\\xa0 Assuming I understood that right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy straightened a little, as if he\\u2019d withered in the time since he\\u2019d been rejected by \\u2018his girl\\u2019.\\xa0 He lowered his head in a short nod.\\xa0 \\u201cYou did.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I glanced at her.</p>\\n<p>Her expression was flat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were going to sell out my acquaintance?\\u201d Mauer asked Fray.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe never formally agreed on that.\\xa0 It came up, and I planned to discuss it here, before we parted ways.\\xa0 Keeping in mind they don\\u2019t have much leverage anymore, beyond Helen\\u2019s promise of mutually assured destruction.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen held up the canister.</p>\\n<p>The Brechwell Beast roared outside.\\xa0 It was closer than it had been.</p>\\n<p>The two were talking, but all of my focus was on Mary.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d confessed a grave lie that I\\u2019d kept for a year and a half, and she wasn\\u2019t giving me anything at all.</p>\\n<p>No anger, no tears, no outrage.</p>\\n<p>Was she stepping away?\\xa0 Figuring out how to leave?\\xa0 Or, worse, was she <em>staying</em>, while attacking me in the worst way possible, by shutting me out and denying any and all connection between us?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon\\u2019s right, Sy,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re really terrible at being honest.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I don\\u2019t know what that means!\\xa0 </em>I screamed, internally.</p>\\n<p>Externally, I didn\\u2019t move an inch or make a sound.</p>\\n<p>Mauer drew his gun.\\xa0 Percy reached for one as well.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t need to go this far,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cSylvester confessed the lie, there\\u2019s no reason to hold to that part of the deal, am I right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKill him,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cPercy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d\\xa0 Percy asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou heard what he said, he-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI heard,\\u201d Mary said, voice cold.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat he just said makes more sense than what you both were saying, back in the meeting room back there, the story I heard in the past.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen- this is about the <em>children</em>?\\xa0 The work I do?\\xa0 It bothers you so much?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary shook her head.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 You shaped me, honed me into a tool, a weapon.\\xa0 You could kill a thousand children a year and it wouldn\\u2019t bother me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen why?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 There was a note of anguish in his voice. \\u201cYou want me to <em>die</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt bothers <em>her</em>,\\u201d Mary said, pointing at Lillian.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd she\\u2019s important to me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m assuming you can\\u2019t be convinced otherwise?\\u201d Mauer asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Mauer nodded.\\xa0 His sonorous voice carried, even as he spoke to himself, \\u201cThat\\u2019s problematic.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d Percy said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re important to me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mauer turned, and with the <em>crack</em> of a pistol shot, he put a bullet through an anguished Percy\\u2019s head.</p>\\n<p>Percy\\u2019s body crumpled to the floor.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe could have found another option,\\u201d Fray said, looking down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like to <em>go</em>,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a loss, but one I\\u2019m willing to live with if it means leaving the city before a small army closes in on us.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll owe me something in compensation for <em>expediting </em>matters.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs you wish,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 She turned to the rest of us.\\xa0 \\u201cAnother day.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnother day,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She turned her back to us, taking Warren\\u2019s hand as help to make it through the broken window.</p>\\n<p><em>Letting them go\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>Helen held the grenade, making motions as if she was gauging her ability to accurately throw it through the window at the small army massed outside.</p>\\n<p>Gordon reached out, putting a hand on her wrist.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\u201d she asked, sounding mournful.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCats and cockroaches,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cSome would survive, and it would be the most exceptional ones.\\xa0 Not worth it.\\xa0 Besides, they could have done the same to us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He held her wrist firm while he took the pin from his pocket and put it through the slot.\\xa0 He took the weapon from Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t stop us from sending everything we can after them,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFor all the good it\\u2019ll do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can try,\\u201d Gordon said, nodding.\\xa0 He drew in a deep breath, then exhaled.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ll have to see how-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary, standing beside Gordon, tilted her head to one side, until it rested against Gordon\\u2019s shoulder.\\xa0 Her arm reached around his waist.\\xa0 Her eyes were fixed on Percy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026How bad it is up there.\\xa0 Are you wanting to stay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI like being like this, but the mission comes first.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou doing that for me, you didn\\u2019t-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re my friend,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She smiled a little.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay.\\xa0 I feel better than I have in a long time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re sure-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm-hmm,\\u201d Mary said, nodding, her head rubbing against Gordon\\u2019s shoulder.\\xa0 Just being like this, she was closer than she\\u2019d been getting to him for a while.\\xa0 Gordon seemed to be taking it in stride.\\xa0 She spoke, \\u201cThank you, everyone.\\xa0 Sy especially.\\xa0 I appreciate this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re <em>absolutely</em> sure you\\u2019re okay-\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI will stab the next person to ask if I\\u2019m okay,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d I asked, without missing a beat.</p>\\n<p>She moved her head off of Gordon\\u2019s shoulder, turning my way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait,\\u201d I said, \\u201chold on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She approached me, drawing a knife.</p>\\n<p>She was a few feet away when she stopped.</p>\\n<p>Looking up at the stairs.</p>\\n<p>My first thought was that the enemy had circled back or come down and found us.</p>\\n<p>Worse.</p>\\n<p>Two young individuals stood on the staircase, twelve and thirteen, going by appearance alone.\\xa0 I knew better.</p>\\n<p>One had red hair, parted to one side, wearing a white collared shirt only, despite the cold weather, with dark brown slacks.\\xa0 He had a folded umbrella in one hand.\\xa0 He had freckles on his face, and his eyes- the eyes were intense, amber colored, more like that of a wolf than a person.</p>\\n<p>Those eyes were the most alive part of him.\\xa0 Helen, even in the earliest days, was better at looking like a proper human than he was.</p>\\n<p>Beside Ashton was a familiar face, dressed wrong.\\xa0 The hair was still long, but it was combed straight back.\\xa0 The glasses had changed, and were oval, slender, more like reading glasses than anything else.\\xa0 His shirt had a high collar, not folded, with a ribbon around it, and he wore a coat with a hood, but carried no bag and held no book.\\xa0 He <em>held</em> himself differently.</p>\\n<p>His eyes, as he looked at us, showed no glimmer of familiarity.\\xa0 Recognition, yes, but not in the way it counted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou let them go?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/11/26/tooth-and-nail-7-15/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Gordon touched Lillian\\u2019s shoulder, then touched his wrist.\\xa0 Lillian retrieved her watch from her pocket and popped it open to show Gordon.\\xa0 When I craned my head to see, she turned it so the rest of us could see.</p>\\n<p>Fifteen minutes.</p>\\n<p>Genevieve Fray\\u2019s contingent was at one end of the room.\\xa0 Fray was still dressed up, staring a hole into the ground while her mind searched for answers.\\xa0 Warren was wearing his suit, Avis wore a strappy evening dress with grafted wings on her back, and the stitched girl, Whitney or Winnie or whatever it was, was wearing simpler clothes with an apron.\\xa0 The clothes were clean and tidy, and her hair looked nice, combed into a side braid that helped hide how dry the hair was.</p>\\n<p>A gulf separated her group from the rest of us, Mauer\\u2019s people, a number of soldiers, three or four civilians, Percy, and the doctor with the cat-like warbeast.\\xa0 Four paces of empty space between us and them.\\xa0 The people who had been standing there were making noise out in the hallway.\\xa0 I could hear the sound of guns being prepared, orders given, and a discussion of strategy, though I couldn\\u2019t make out particulars.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLambs,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI did promise I would talk with you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mauer spoke from the other end of the room, his voice low, \\u201cGiven the circumstances, we should overlook old promises and focus on our immediate future.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBe patient,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cLambs, a word?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We started to cross the gap between the rest of the room and Fray.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI took countermeasures before coming here,\\u201d Mauer commented.\\xa0 \\u201cPolitics are something I understand.\\xa0 I expect them to take me alive, where possible.\\xa0 You?\\xa0 I\\u2019m not so sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou could be shot on sight,\\u201d Avis said, \\u201cOr killed by accident.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be the reason I\\u2019m talking to Fray and looking to cooperate and see if her strategy is still intact,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 He had a dangerous look in his eye.\\xa0 \\u201cBut if she wants me to be patient, then I can give her a few minutes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We reached Fray\\u2019s group.\\xa0 There was a table set against the wall, with a teapot, cups, and candlesticks on the top.\\xa0 I pushed a candlestick out of the way and hopped up onto the table.\\xa0 It gave me a good view of the whole room.</p>\\n<p>Gordon leaned against the table beside me, Mary beside him.\\xa0 Lillian stood by the table\\u2019s end, at my right shoulder, Helen just a little further away.\\xa0 Hubris was under my dangling feet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe books, give,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cContingent on us actually having a <em>talk</em>,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen talk,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Fray nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cI received a note from a little birdy-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoggie,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She reached down and scratched Hubris\\u2019 head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t sure if you were wholly aware it was them, but I suspected.\\xa0 I was confused for a moment that it seemed to think you were here already, and it didn\\u2019t help that I was preoccupied with Cynthia.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWere we responsible for <em>that</em> confusion too?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry to disappoint you, but it was a question of ideology,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow so?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia started on the bottom, at one of the lowest points a human being can occupy, orphaned, alone, barely more than an animal.\\xa0 She fought her way to the place she holds now in the world, and she plans to keep on going.\\xa0 I believe she wants to <em>supplant </em>the Crown, even in a token manner.\\xa0 To be the new ruler or a major power when the Crown is ejected from the western Crown States.\\xa0 She doesn\\u2019t like my plan because giving <em>everyone</em> the power to study Academy sciences takes away from her exclusive power.\\xa0 Raise everyone else up, and she is effectively less powerful.\\xa0 She would rather control that power, utilize some of the best and brightest minds she can collect, and be well situated to take power as it becomes available.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUntil the Crown brings all the force it can muster to bear,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI underestimated her hunger for that taste of true authority, however transient it might end up being.\\xa0 I\\u2019d hoped rational argument would sway her, and I was proven wrong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wanted to jab at Fray, just to see how she reacted.\\xa0 If I commented on how poor her \\u2018rational\\u2019 argument might be, if my estimation of her was right, then it would sting, and she might show me a glimmer of what she was <em>really</em> thinking.</p>\\n<p>Instead, I frowned and only said, \\u201cThat night I burned her alive, I didn\\u2019t just hurt her chances in politics.\\xa0 The Lambs killed some of those best and brightest minds.\\xa0 No wonder she was upset with me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fray nodded her head in agreement.\\xa0 \\u201cTelling you more would be unfair and rude, when she was at least kind enough to hear me out.\\xa0 I think you can draw the appropriate conclusions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat you\\u2019re doing,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cGiving everyone access, you\\u2019re going to cause complete and utter chaos.\\xa0 There are rules the Academy won\\u2019t break that novice students will.\\xa0 Uncontrolled growth, <em>real</em> monsters, <em>real</em> weapons of war.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was on track for a professorship,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI got close, close enough that I heard the stories.\\xa0 I promise you, Lillian, there are people crossing those lines every single day, in various places around the world.\\xa0 One or two of the people you\\u2019ve gone after at the Academy\\u2019s behest have been among them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can back this,\\u201d Avis said, her voice soft.\\xa0 \\u201cA lot of the messages about the worst crisis situations crossed my desk.\\xa0 For every one the Lambs saw, there were four more within two days of train travel from Radham Academy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a fallacy,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cJust because people are crossing the line, that doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s okay if you increase the problem a hundredfold.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTenfold at best, but in talking to the others, the expectation seems to be a much more conservative doubling or tripling in the number of madmen and dangerous minds,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cOnly a select portion of the population have the means, motive, inclination, and ability to truly take advantage of what I would be putting out there.\\xa0 Not so much the Academy couldn\\u2019t respond, but enough to keep them and the likes of <em>you</em> busy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got Dog and Catcher, very likely Petey and the Wry Man, all on your side.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve been working to strip the Academy\\u2019s ability to respond to an upswing in the number of problem elements.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ll bounce back.\\xa0 It does mean they\\u2019ll have a hard time controlling the spread of the books at the outset.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m seeing what you\\u2019re doing,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay, let\\u2019s say that the numbers do double.\\xa0 Very conservative.\\xa0 But you told everyone here that the two factions would be attacking one last time, playing all the leftover cards they have left to play, to distract the Academy and apply pressure to them.\\xa0 That alone would occupy the resources that would control the spread of the book.\\xa0 But you\\u2019re also denying them those resources, getting Dog and Catcher and some of the others on your side.\\xa0 If you actually turned Dog and Catcher and some of the others against the Academy, or used information they\\u2019ve given you to lash out at key targets\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fray\\u2019s expression wasn\\u2019t giving up many tells.\\xa0 She seemed amused, insofar as her anxiety seemed to be allowing her to enjoy herself.</p>\\n<p><em>Yeah, let\\u2019s not puff you up and make you feel too happy and in control,</em> I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026You\\u2019re being disingenuous,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s more to this.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t intend to push them over.\\xa0 You want to break their back on your knee.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to hurt the Academy,\\u201d Fray told me.\\xa0 \\u201cSlow them down, give the rest of us some time to gain ground.\\xa0 Yes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen say it straight,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou trying to mislead us here makes me think you\\u2019re bending the truth when you give Lillian your expectations.\\xa0 Forget the others.\\xa0 What do <em>you</em> think the numbers will be like?\\xa0 How many dangerous minds are going to go too far with your books?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.\\xa0 I saw her shoot me a glance, and I suspected it was a <em>grateful</em> look.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d backed her where and when it counted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore than a fivefold increase in what you\\u2019re dealing with now,\\u201d Fray admitted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd how many people are going to die?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s no telling, it\\u2019s too variable,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you\\u2019ve heard of the cockroaches and cats principle?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled.</p>\\n<p>Gordon put it succinctly, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve discussed it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cIf you\\u2019re talking about cockroaches and cats, what you\\u2019re doing is a <em>very bad thing</em>!\\xa0 You\\u2019re talking about killing nine in ten people?\\xa0 Nineteen in twenty?\\xa0 People only survive because of sheer numbers?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs you can see, the medic of the group is opposed to what you\\u2019re doing,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd the rest of you?\\u201d Fray asked, very casually.</p>\\n<p>It was Mary who spoke up, \\u201cIf you can\\u2019t convince her, then you aren\\u2019t going to budge the rest of us.\\xa0 The Lambs stick together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fray nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cI see.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a pause.\\xa0 An explosion outside made the entire room jump.\\xa0 Too close to the deadline.</p>\\n<p>Fray turned to Warren, murmuring in his ear.\\xa0 I caught the essential bits, enough to piece it together after a second of thought.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Go check on Cynthia.\\xa0 Let me know if she\\u2019s getting ready to go or waiting</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren nodded, then left the room.</p>\\n<p>Fray composed herself, taking a second before turning to look us over.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s time to have a full-fledged debate on the merits of one course or another.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDisingenuous again,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are a lot of courses, a lot of decisions to be made.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t say there were only two courses,\\u201d Fray said, sounding annoyed, \\u201cMy point was that we\\u2019re short on time.\\xa0 I expect only fifteen minutes, if the news about the train being early wasn\\u2019t Lamb trickery.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She gave us a look as she said those last words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not,\\u201d Gordon said, firmly.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s less than ten minutes, not fifteen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He put his hands in his pockets as he spoke.\\xa0 I could see his thumb move.\\xa0 Not a true gesture, but damn close to the movement of a \\u2018<em>lie</em>\\u2018 gesture.</p>\\n<p>Giving her less time to work with, more pressure.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe would have shown up twenty minutes before the <em>real</em> deadline if it was, after we\\u2019d let you stew and worry for a while, and after we\\u2019d complicated your communications with Dog, Catcher and the others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs you tried to do with the Ghosts,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 She sighed.\\xa0 \\u201cYou did force us to sacrifice a large share of them, so Petey could maintain his cover.\\xa0 The release of the Brechwell Beast was much the same.\\xa0 I believe you when you say the deadline is real.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hear actual anxiety in your voice,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA tightness?\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think I hear it too, but I\\u2019m not that good with my new ears yet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren returned.\\xa0 He rejoined us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs she leaving yet?\\u201d\\xa0 Fray asked.</p>\\n<p>He changed the angle of his head a fraction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSoon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf all else fails, we might have to let her be the vanguard, and simply follow in her wake,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cKnowing her, it might prove difficult.\\xa0 She\\u2019s as liable to be as dangerous to us as the enemy forces are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren nodded again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAvis, we\\u2019ll need you to deliver the signal soon,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 She looked at us.\\xa0 \\u201cCatcher\\u2019s note said you had deduced that I plan to turn the forces of Brechwell against one another.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m flattered you think I could convince that many people.\\xa0 I\\u2019m afraid I didn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen I think you\\u2019re kind of an idiot for getting into this situation,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p><em>Provoke, push, test boundaries.\\xa0 </em>I\\u2019d passed up a chance earlier, because it was too hard, too harsh.\\xa0 This was a softer touch.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d expected to gauge her response to the casual insult, in hopes of gleaning some insight into her mental state.\\xa0 Fray didn\\u2019t betray anything, however, and it was <em>Warren</em> who seemed to take offense at the slight against Fray.</p>\\n<p>Worth remembering.\\xa0 Maybe I could write it down.\\xa0 My memories seemed to slip most between when I went to sleep and when I woke up.\\xa0 Since the girls insisted on sleeping with me, I couldn\\u2019t stay up and achieve a balance of recall and alertness.\\xa0 I wouldn\\u2019t be able to trust my brain to hold onto the little strategic details like Warren\\u2019s defensiveness of his savior.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do have a plan,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt achieves very similar ends, but without the need for me to target and convince however many soldiers, officers, and major figures I would need to organize a true mutiny.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFantastic,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you made a miscalculation, you\\u2019ve lost Cynthia\\u2019s help.\\xa0 You\\u2019re worried, because what you <em>did</em> have planned doesn\\u2019t necessarily work that well without her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll manage,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe <em>real </em>question is if you\\u2019re coming with us.\\xa0 It doesn\\u2019t have to be permanent.\\xa0 Follow along, I\\u2019ll give you the books, and we can have a more in-depth conversation in the aftermath of Brechwell\\u2019s fall.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t respond.\\xa0 My mind was taking in new information, ticking over possibilities.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think that would be dangerous,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we came with you, how much would it delay our return to the Academy?\\xa0 Would we be assumed to be one of the turncoat special projects?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s for you to decide,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 She stood straighter.\\xa0 \\u201cI suppose you\\u2019ll have to make do.\\xa0 Decide what you will, I need to focus on the matter at hand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Not a mutiny, but similar in execution.\\xa0 What\\u2019s she planning?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Fray had started to walk away, Warren, Avis and the stitched girl following.\\xa0 She paused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI said it was dangerous, I didn\\u2019t say <em>no</em>.\\xa0 If the other Lambs agree, maybe I could propose a deal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTime is short,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat deal?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll come with you, hear you out, have a <em>serious</em> discussion with no time limit<em>, </em>but\\u2026\\u201d Mary dropped her voice, \\u201cPercy dies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My breath caught in my throat.\\xa0 I almost sputtered.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t the only Lamb reacting with shock.\\xa0 All eyes were on Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd,\\u201d Mary continued, meeting Lillian\\u2019s eyes, \\u201cYou promise to excise all portions of your work that deal with the biology of <em>children</em>.\\xa0 The ratios, the specific formulas, growth charts, scales, proportions\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll of it,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cA concrete loss of both an ally and resources, a loss in <em>time</em> to ensure the books are properly edited, in exchange for a discussion where there is no guarantee I\\u2019d be able to convince you all?\\xa0 What makes you think I\\u2019d accept?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary opened her mouth to speak, paused, and glanced at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester briefed you on me,\\u201d Fray concluded.\\xa0 \\u201cI see.\\xa0 I want to ask why you want me to kill your creator, but there\\u2019s no time.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll take your proposal under consideration.\\xa0 Excuse me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Like that, she was gone.</p>\\n<p>I blinked a few times.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester is a bad influence on you,\\u201d Gordon commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cSorry, to throw that out there, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou need to cut ties formally,\\u201d Gordon guessed.</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>Lillian walked past me, reaching out to give Mary a little hug, before taking Mary\\u2019s hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s actually considering it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cPercy is a known element, he\\u2019s one-note, only effective right now because of the ability to incorporate the work of others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said she wanted to convince others,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought we could offer her a way to convince <em>us</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was smart,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou hit the mark.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>But Percy isn\\u2019t as guilty as you think he is.\\xa0 By letting you sign a deal paid for in his blood, I can never tell you the whole truth</em>.\\xa0 <em>You\\u2019d never forgive me.</em></p>\\n<p>Well, eventually, she might, but a theoretical five-year grudge was a long time in respect to our short lifespans.</p>\\n<p>Something to worry about later.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was surprised you seemed to drop out of that conversation,\\u201d Gordon observed.\\xa0 He was watching the people on the other side of the room, who were watching <em>us\\xa0</em> while they talked with Fray.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThinking,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cTrying to decipher what she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo tell.\\xa0 Thinking aloud is a good thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot a mutiny, but similar.\\xa0 She said she couldn\\u2019t convince <em>that many</em> people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Turn that around.\\xa0 What\\u2019s the bare minimum she needs, in order to turn the tide of the battle?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBare minimum?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cFive hundred people?\\xa0 Once they start shooting, they don\\u2019t know who is friendly and who isn\\u2019t, it throws everything into disarray.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFewer,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFewer.\\xa0 Didn\\u2019t <em>one</em> person just risk derailing this entire thing Fray was trying to accomplish?\\xa0 Cynthia walked away.\\xa0 She\\u2019s waiting to execute her own plan.\\xa0 Fray doesn\\u2019t know what to expect.\\xa0 What if\\u2026 what if Fray only talked to two or three people?\\xa0 And the secret experiments, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I trailed off, thinking.\\xa0 <em>Experiments.\\xa0 Why?\\xa0 They\\u2019re the ones who provide information, they execute critical missions, they wipe out stragglers\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>I was staring off into space the same way Fray had been, sitting a matter of feet from where she\\u2019d been standing, and smiled at the realization.\\xa0 The difference between her situation and mine, however, was that I was asking a question which had a very real answer.\\xa0 Fray had had to invent an answer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCommanding officers?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re the only people here with enough clout.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\xa0 But if you give orders and the people you\\u2019re ordering balk, then you lose that clout.\\xa0 You need to <em>convince</em> them\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Weapons of rhetoric.\\xa0 How to make people act the way they wouldn\\u2019t normally?\\xa0 Rage?\\xa0 Easy but not applicable here.\\xa0 Revulsion?\\xa0 Took time to sell a seeming ally as truly repulsive and deserving of acts beyond the pale.\\xa0 Terror?\\xa0 No, not quite, and I couldn\\u2019t imagine a way of creating that sort of effect.\\xa0 Grief?\\xa0 Mauer had tried it, using the deaths of children to turn the people of Radham against the Academy.</em></p>\\n<p>More complex emotions, then.\\xa0 <em>Outrage, cornered-rat feeling, horror, empathy, desperation, devastation, disappointment\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p><em>\\u2026Betrayal.</em></p>\\n<p>I looked up, meeting Gordon\\u2019s eyes.</p>\\n<p><em>Betrayal, panic.\\xa0 </em>Hadn\\u2019t I just been thinking recently about how I kept going back to fire and destruction?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have an idea,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I watched Avis leave the room.\\xa0 Ready to give the signal.</p>\\n<p>I would\\u2019ve liked to follow behind and interrupt Avis before she could follow through, just to see the look on Fray\\u2019s face, but it would have been too obvious.</p>\\n<p>All of the tension in the Academy\\u2019s ranks, it was building up to a crescendo.\\xa0 The people on the wall, guns in hand, cold, waiting for a battle to start, they were coiled like snakes, ready to strike.</p>\\n<p>Their eyes faced forward, but when the attack came from the sides, from allied ranks, it would be pandemonium.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust the commanding officers and sufficient chaos, so the rank and file look to the leader,\\u201d I said, my voice low.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd all you need to convince the commanding officers is to assure them that the blame can be pointed at the man who is nominally in charge.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho everyone hates,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow do you create sufficient chaos?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWithout Dog and Catcher-\\u201d I started.</p>\\n<p>Fray cut me off, from the other end of the room.\\xa0 \\u201cLambs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We turned our full attention to her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m trying to convince these men that you\\u2019re trustworthy enough to have behind us,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a hard argument to make when I\\u2019m not sure myself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPercy convinced me to hold back and treat you gently,\\u201d Mauer said, \\u201cHearing your response to him, I\\u2019m wondering if I shouldn\\u2019t just have my soldiers shoot you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Some of the men shifted their grips on their guns.</p>\\n<p>I could see the look on Percy\\u2019s face.\\xa0 The man looked troubled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe doesn\\u2019t seem convinced.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSometimes we have to sacrifice a friendship in the name of being a true friend,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p>Percy scowled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis would be easier if you agreed to come,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd our deal?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019d rather remain here and try to convince the Academy you were acting in <em>their</em> interest and not mine, feel free,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cOtherwise, I might leave this up to the Reverend Mauer.\\xa0 No deal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not a Reverend any more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>That is a problem</em>, I mused.\\xa0 If there was treachery afoot, and if any experiments did find themselves in question, people would wonder about <em>us</em>.\\xa0 We were badly situated for that.</p>\\n<p>She was genuinely nervous, now, and it came through in how ruthlessly she was throwing her weight around to remove uncertainties.\\xa0 Fray was a perfectionist, she overthought her plans and covered every base, until she was capable of managing any crisis that came up.\\xa0 But when two came up at the same time, the loose ends of the Lambs and the issue of Cynthia acting on her own, then she couldn\\u2019t be <em>sure</em> she had an escape route or sufficient distraction to escape.\\xa0 Too many angles to watch.</p>\\n<p>That wouldn\\u2019t do, not for her.</p>\\n<p>No, for this to be a true success, she needed to walk through a battlefield and disappear.\\xa0 That could only happen if she had a measure of control over every side present.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you think?\\u201d Gordon murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOption one is to reassure her that the Lambs aren\\u2019t a threat.\\xa0 Join her, give up power and the little advantage we hold,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOption two?\\u201d Mary asked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe make her <em>more</em> unsure,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI like option two more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLast chance,\\u201d Fray declared.\\xa0 \\u201cCome with us, or-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s a problem with that,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p><em>\\u201cI thought you\\u2019d say, not demonstrate</em>,\\u201d Gordon hissed in my ear.</p>\\n<p>Fray spoke, \\u201cMauer, you can tell your men-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe disarmed one of the bombs,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She stopped.</p>\\n<p>I saw her eyes fix onto a point in space, as she turned over the possibilities in her mind.</p>\\n<p><em>She didn\\u2019t detonate every bomb in the city when she paved the way for the Brechwell Beast.</em></p>\\n<p><em>She had the</em> <em>experiments patrolling the city at night, perfect for setting up more bombs.\\xa0 Explosions in friendly ranks, from bombs placed in the tops of attics like the one we entered, detonating through the rooftops, multiple commanders shouting that it\\u2019s friendly mortar fire, maybe even shouting about fire from once-friendly teams, the insecurity of new teams joining, unfamiliar faces, and the intelligence gathering bodies turning tail and giving false info or helping Fray navigate her way through, while all the smoke and debris blocks the view of the street\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p><em>Pandemonium.\\xa0 The man at the top gets blamed for not having control of an uncontrollable situation</em>.</p>\\n<p>Fray looked up, meeting my eyes.</p>\\n<p>Searching for the lie.</p>\\n<p><em>But if one bomb doesn\\u2019t explode, she can\\u2019t predict the situation</em>.\\xa0 <em>The tide of the fight can\\u2019t be predicted.\\xa0 One side could be free to open fire on you.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWarren,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cFind Avis.\\xa0 Stop her from giving the signal.\\xa0 <em>Run.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren charged out of the room.\\xa0 The man with the cat warbeast leaned close to Fray, and got one word out before she indicated for him to go too.\\xa0 He and his cat fled the room.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMauer,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 Her eyes didn\\u2019t leave me.\\xa0 \\u201cIf he doesn\\u2019t say <em>which</em> bomb the Lambs disarmed-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to have to come to us for a way out,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I could see her thinking her way through the options.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t get a chance to finish her train of thought.</p>\\n<p>Nearby explosions rocked the building.\\xa0 Guns fired.\\xa0 I could see the concern on the faces of the others.</p>\\n<p>Had Avis given the signal already?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be Cynthia, charging for freedom,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>Then, one by one, other explosions sounded.\\xa0 I could hear the tumble and crumble of falling masonry.\\xa0 Shouts, gunfire, distant but so unanimous that it <em>had</em> to be the forces arranged at the perimeter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be your bombs,\\u201d Gordon observed, dryly.</p>\\n<p>I cleared my throat.\\xa0 \\u201cNow, please, give me the damn books, Miss Fray.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

included.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 He removed the stopper from the vial and downed it.\\xa0 He grimaced.\\xa0 Lillian and Mary did much the same.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d the boy said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s just for a little while.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>His eye moved over to Percy\\u2019s body.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did you hear?\\u201d\\xa0 Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you tell me what happened, first?\\u201d the boy asked, calm.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll see if it matches up to what we saw and heard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was confident, wary.\\xa0 Jamie had always hung in the background, quiet, nose in his books.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s confidence was a different sort.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cFeel up to taking a stab at explaining?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The words caught in my throat as I stared at the boy.</p>\\n<p>Anything else, I could have managed.\\xa0 I could have found the words, braved my way through, been clever, whatever needed to happen.</p>\\n<p>But he was here, staring at me with <em>Jamie\\u2019s</em> eyes, no familiarity, loaded to bear with accusation.</p>\\n<p><em>That</em>, I couldn\\u2019t deal with.\\xa0 It penetrated every defense I had to hit me right where it hurt most.\\xa0 A part of my mind and feelings I hadn\\u2019t figured out how to patch up the missing pieces, fix the pieces that weren\\u2019t working with, or even muster the feelings I needed to cope with it at all.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGuess not,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMight be for the best,\\u201d the boy said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been reading the books, trying to get caught up.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019d believe what Sy said.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot being sure about Sy?\\xa0 Eighty percent of what you need to learn, when it comes to Sy,\\u201d Gordon said, a light smile on his face.\\xa0 \\u201cRealizing you have to take that leap anyway?\\xa0 That\\u2019s another ten percent.\\xa0 The rest is crammed into the remaining ten percent.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The boy smiled a little.\\xa0 Too similar.\\xa0 I looked away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cHi, Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll try explaining?\\xa0 Because I\\u2019m probably the worst liar here, I think?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be great.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s good,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA while back, Fray reached out to us, too, back-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDame Cicely\\u2019s,\\u201d the boy said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s in the books.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.\\xa0 She fidgeted nervously with the strap of her satchel.\\xa0 \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t take that offer.\\xa0 But she reached out to Dog and Catcher and some others.\\xa0 They switched sides.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The boy\\u2019s eyes narrowed.\\xa0 He looked up at the ceiling.\\xa0 \\u201cDog and Catcher told us to wait here for you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid they say anything else?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d the boy said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey said, \\u2018it\\u2019s a shame we have to say goodbye so soon after saying hello for the first time\\u2019.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re leaving,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe found them out, they can\\u2019t stay, so they\\u2019re going to do what they have to do and then disappear.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt makes sense,\\u201d the boy said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe tone, the wording.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He said it like it was a prompt to keep going.</p>\\n<p>Lillian fidgeted more.\\xa0 She glanced at me, then looked away, the eye contact equivalent of touching a hot pan handle.\\xa0 \\u201cWe realized we were in a bad situation, that what\\u2019s happening up there was about to happen.\\xa0 No way to avoid it, unless we left the area and abandoned the mission. \\xa0 We debated whether or not to take her offer to join, and we decided not to.\\xa0 But the fact that she\\u2019d <em>asked,</em> it meant we could get close.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The boy nodded.</p>\\n<p>Lillian continued, \\u201cBeing there was better than being <em>here</em>, especially when we weren\\u2019t sure how she would get bullets to start flying and bombs exploding.\\xa0 Being there in the other building meant we could talk.\\xa0 Mary could talk to Percy, we could talk to Fray, try to guide things\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe got them to kill Percy, at Mary\\u2019s request, and we got information, coming from there to here with each side holding the other at gunpoint, in a manner of speaking.\\xa0 We let them go because there was nothing we could do against their numbers and the kind of force they could bring to bear,\\u201d Gordon finished.\\xa0 \\u201cThey left us behind because Fray wants to keep an open dialogue.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The boy looked between each of us, then looked back at Ashton.\\xa0 Ashton was giving Hubris a a pat on the head.\\xa0 He looked at his companion, and very softly said, \\u201cIt makes sense?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The boy in Jamie\\u2019s skin nodded in response.\\xa0 He was agreeing, but still didn\\u2019t look <em>sure</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know it looks bad,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut there weren\\u2019t any options that were <em>great</em>, once we realized what was happening.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d the boy said.\\xa0 \\u201cI believe her, and I know what you mean, about the options.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve read the books.\\xa0 The ones I had, that is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>One syllable, that was better than nothing at all.</p>\\n<p>I took the backpack, and I held it out.</p>\\n<p>He crossed the distance, and he took the bag from me.\\xa0 He checked the weight, then handed it back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep it for now?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 When my expression was one of confusion, he said, \\u201cI\\u2019m tender.\\xa0 Too many days in the chair.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I took the bag, and slung it over my shoulders, stepping back.\\xa0 Lillian touched my upper arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike I said, I read the books,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve got this mental picture of each of you, all from words on the page.\\xa0 Months and years of writing and notes.\\xa0 Mentally, I can sort it, the dates, I can pull all the details together into something that should be\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gestured, unable to find the word.</p>\\n<p>That was odd.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree-dimensional?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>He smiled, a soft, easy expression.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you.\\xa0 I haven\\u2019t met any of you, and it feels <em>flat</em> in my head, even if I try to pull it all into a shape.\\xa0 I know the particulars, how the Lambs operate, how each of you operate, the hand-signs, the details of past missions, but it\\u2019s all still images, broken up.\\xa0 I know exactly what you mean, about the issues you run into during a mission, except in a very page-turning, pen-on-paper way.\\xa0 I understand there aren\\u2019t many great options, sometimes.\\xa0 That we scrape by when things get bad.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll pick things up,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s good to have you both with us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon extended a hand.\\xa0 The boy shook it, then pulled Gordon into an awkward sort of half-hug.</p>\\n<p>Then he hugged Mary, Helen, and Lillian in that order.</p>\\n<p>I was the last one he approached.</p>\\n<p>In the background, Helen was greeting Ashton.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s so sad!\\xa0 They gave you red hair!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen!\\u201d Mary rebuked her, while keeping one eye on my imminent exchange with the new boy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEveryone says that a man can\\u2019t be truly handsome if he has red hair!\\xa0 And freckles too!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t say that to his face, Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Oblivious to the ongoing conversation behind him, <em>he</em> stood a short distance from me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAshton doesn\\u2019t mind,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t mind,\\u201d Ashton said.</p>\\n<p>My view was partially blocked by the boy who stood in front of me, but I saw Helen throw her arms around Ashton, hugging him.\\xa0 He stayed there, arms limp at his side, as she rocked him back and forth.\\xa0 She said something I guessed to be \\u2018little brother\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>I returned my focus to the boy.\\xa0 Everyone that wasn\\u2019t Helen or Ashton seemed to be watching us.\\xa0 More pressure.</p>\\n<p>There were a hundred things that were going through my head, things I could say and every single one of them had bad implications.</p>\\n<p>Whatever.\\xa0 I would try one.\\xa0 Starting simple.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs there something I can call you?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I flinched.\\xa0 My eyes found the ground and I couldn\\u2019t bring myself to look away from it.\\xa0 Not even his feet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d he said, realizing.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s the name they gave me.\\xa0 I think they would be annoyed if I used a different one.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t respond to that.</p>\\n<p>He would have to be Jamie.\\xa0 Just like there were other Sylvesters in the world.\\xa0 A different person with the same name.\\xa0 He just so happened to have the same face, voice, and expressions.</p>\\n<p>It was hard to breathe, like I somehow had the weight of ten bags of books pressing down on my chest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid they keep, find, rebuild <em>anything</em>?\\u201d I managed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot the things you\\u2019re asking about, Sy,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey gave me lessons, while digging for the key things.\\xa0 How to walk again, how to speak, how to read, how to get dressed.\\xa0 When it got too hard, they focused the lessons on re-teaching it from scratch, hoping that I\\u2019d be able to dredge up those memories if I could meet them halfway.\\xa0 Some I did, others I\\u2026 learned how to do all over again.\\xa0 There are gaps, simple things I\\u2019m still re-learning, but they thought I was ready enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s why they didn\\u2019t want you to see us?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause you might have met us halfway to rebuild memories?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey thought it would muddy the waters.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked up, meeting Jamie\\u2019s eyes, \\u201cThen there\\u2019s a chance that, if you have an appointment after this, having met us again\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I realized what I was saying.\\xa0 That weight on my chest wasn\\u2019t going away.\\xa0 I faltered, falling silent again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think, if that chance existed, they wouldn\\u2019t have let me out to see you.\\xa0 They\\u2019re more focused on other things.\\xa0 Skills, background knowledge.\\xa0 How efficiently knowledge can be pulled from the tanks when the slate is clean.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could still hear the muffled violence and noise outside, fire, destruction, screaming, unheard orders to do this or do that, all while men died.\\xa0 It felt like\\xa0 a pretty good match to what I was feeling inside of my chest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to tell me about him,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay?\\xa0 About the first Jamie?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I exhaled, a long shuddering breath.</p>\\n<p>Okay.</p>\\n<p>Somehow, the fact that he\\u2019d asked that question, it made this bearable.\\xa0 Meeting halfway.</p>\\n<p>I extended a hand.\\xa0 I felt Jamie\\u2019s hand in mine as he shook it.</p>\\n<p>That done, I stepped around him, putting him behind me.\\xa0 I approached Ashton, who Helen was now hugging from behind.\\xa0 The heel of one hand wiped tears out of one eye.\\xa0 The heel of the other hand wiped at the other.</p>\\n<p>Ashton.\\xa0 He stared at me with those amber-yellow eyes.</p>\\n<p>My voice didn\\u2019t come out at full strength or even half-strength as I spoke, \\u201cHi Ashton.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been wanting to meet you for a really long time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi\\u2026 Sylvester?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re sad,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I felt like my voice would catch if I spoke out loud, so I just nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can make you happy again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo you can\\u2019t, dum-dum,\\u201d I said, my voice still faint and hoarse.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m immune to you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe too,\\u201d Helen said, still hugging Ashton from behind, rocking him slightly from side to side.\\xa0 \\u201cBut that\\u2019s because I\\u2019m not human.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I extended a hand.\\xa0 Ashton took it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLike this.\\xa0 Firmer.\\xa0 Grip harder.\\xa0 Keep your wrist straight, not floppy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It took three tries before it was right.\\xa0 On that one firm shake, as was proper between men, I pulled him closer, into a one-armed hug, a little more graceful than Jamie\\u2019s had been with Gordon.\\xa0 Helen let him go just in time.</p>\\n<p>He received it with the same enthusiasm and effectiveness as a wet rope.</p>\\n<p>I released him, backing away and stepping to the side, turning around to look at the Lambs as a whole.\\xa0 Helen reached out to pat down Ashton\\u2019s hair where it was sticking up, post-hug.\\xa0 Then she wrapped her arms around him, one cheek pressed against the side of his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s so new,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cLike a newborn calf who\\u2019s learning to stand, or a chick fresh out of the egg.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s doing a lot of the learning-from-scratch I\\u2019m doing,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe had some of the same lessons.\\xa0 They sent him with me because they thought he\\u2019d learn better in the field than in a sterile room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll make do,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSpeaking of\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s next?\\u201d Mary asked, more to finish Gordon\\u2019s question than to ask it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe could hunker down, keep our heads down, and wait this out,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p><em>Please no</em><em>.\\xa0 Not with Jamie here.\\xa0 Too difficult</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr we could go after Fray,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat.\\xa0 Great.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s do that.\\xa0 She said the North road.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know where that is, but we can figure it out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe road, I\\u2019ve seen the city\\u2019s map, I know the layout.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I felt a momentary dissonance.\\xa0 How could I forget we had that resource, when I\\u2019d been having trouble remembering we <em>didn\\u2019t </em>when he wasn\\u2019t here?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, alright, that\\u2019s great, of course,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>Speaking too quickly.\\xa0 Calm down.\\xa0</em> \\u201cWe\\u2019ll have to catch up to her, anticipating her route, we\\xa0<em>still</em> have to figure out a way to deal with the small army that is keeping her company, and we need to get away alive afterward.\\xa0 But that\\u2019s not too hard.\\xa0 The Lambs have done worse.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Not</em> easy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re in a warzone.\\xa0 The rooftops aren\\u2019t free to roam on.\\xa0 We\\u2019d have to take the streets.\\xa0 Keeping in mind she made a few shortcuts with those bombs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t tell you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot off the top of my head.\\xa0 General direction, maybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen it doesn\\u2019t work,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf she\\u2019s more familiar with the shortcuts than we are, then we\\u2019re not going to catch up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can figure it out on the way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy heart doesn\\u2019t feel great, Hubris was nudging my hand earlier.\\xa0 If we were <em>sure</em>, I\\u2019d go for it, push just a little while longer, but we aren\\u2019t sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Damn it, no.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want to stay cooped up here, feeling like I\\u2019ve got a weight on my chest and someone\\u2019s hand around my throat, pushing my Adam\\u2019s apple in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s more problematic than that,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe other experiments turned coat, they\\u2019re leaving.\\xa0 In the wake of all of this, we\\u2019re going to come under scrutiny.\\xa0 If we don\\u2019t have actual <em>results,</em> something a little bit better than Percy\\u2019s corpse, then that\\u2019s going to hurt us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat bird has flown the coop,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ll manage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, my voice firm now.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 Not like that, not like <em>this</em>.\\xa0 We\\u2019re not giving up like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think we can catch Fray?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Then I thought again.\\xa0 \\u201cYes.\\xa0 It depends.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEverything that\\u2019s going on up there,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe should split up.\\xa0 Two groups.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary spoke, \\u201cSy, I understand if you need space, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Listen</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been too forceful, in saying it, like I was telling her to shut up.\\xa0 I was letting emotion seep into my words, fighting too hard to avoid being sad, speechless, useless.\\xa0 I wanted to <em>do</em> something.\\xa0 \\u201cListen to me, treat this as part of the mission, <em>then</em> decide if I\\u2019m doing it for ulterior reasons.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, Sy,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo groups.\\xa0 We need to balance the groups.\\xa0 Group one, Ashton, Gordon, Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou sure?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 The quickest on the draw, at least while Mary was still slightly preoccupied with Percy\\u2019s death.\\xa0 \\u201cYou-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He saw me start to react.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cListening,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy group, Mary, Jamie, Lillian.\\xa0 You\\u2019re up to climbing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were nods.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not athletic, but I\\u2019ve been exercising, trying to keep the scars flexible, so the sessions in the chair are easier,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m pretty sure I can climb.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was another person in Jamie\\u2019s body.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t remember Jamie ever putting in extra effort to exercise, nor did he like talking about the scars.</p>\\n<p><em>Had </em>he, I reminded myself.\\xa0 Past tense.</p>\\n<p>The books on my back felt like a dead weight, devoid of personality, or even familiarity.\\xa0 There was no association anymore.\\xa0 The thirteen year old boy that stood a few feet away was a constant reminder and yet the furthest thing from a comforting presence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d been staring off into space, thinking too hard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re listening,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon, you and Helen are babysitting Ashton.\\xa0 Get him to the allied command.\\xa0 He\\u2019s going to stretch his legs, practice in the field for the first time.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s see how good of a manipulator he is.\\xa0 We\\u2019re ending this conflict.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEasier said than done,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBullets are flying, we don\\u2019t know what the battlefield up there is like.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can get across fairly easily,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe got up and made it this far, but there\\u2019s a hole in the roof up there, and we needed the help of Dog and Catcher to get from the roof to the safer part of the top floor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShow us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Just like that, we were making our way upstairs.\\xa0 The Lambs, greater in number to what had been originally intended.\\xa0 Minus one Evette, plus one Sylvester and a Mary.</p>\\n<p>And a dog.</p>\\n<p>The second floor was empty.\\xa0 A living room, a kitchen, filled with dust and black smoke, to the point that our footfalls were swiping away stretches of soot and powder.</p>\\n<p>The roof had been blasted open.\\xa0 The attic-level floor was just as dirty, with floorboards scorched black, blackened lumber still smouldering, lying scattered here and there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat side is harder to climb.\\xa0 My group will take it.\\xa0 You guys, go the opposite way.\\xa0 Keep going until you find someone in charge, at least two people at the highest points up the ladder who\\u2019re directing the armies are in Fray\\u2019s pocket, perpetuating this stupid civil war.\\xa0 Get control over that situation.\\xa0 It shouldn\\u2019t be hard, once you find them \\u2013 I doubt they want their own people getting shot any more than is necessary.\\xa0 Fray\\u2019s superweapon moles are going to be running by now, there shouldn\\u2019t be too much interference.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd then?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnce that\\u2019s settled, catch up with us,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ll see how well this works.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood luck.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a mock salute.\\xa0 Helen, meanwhile, had Ashton climb on her back, arms around her neck, while she prepared to climb.</p>\\n<p>When I turned to look at the slope of wreckage my team had to scale to get to the rooftop proper, I realized Jamie was staring at me.</p>\\n<p><em>Focus on the mission</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>If I focus hard enough to block everything out, and my effectiveness is going to skyrocket</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re sure it\\u2019s safe?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot sure, but we weren\\u2019t getting shot at.\\xa0 The focus seems to be along different flanks.\\xa0 Two pairs of major groups limited in movement by the destroyed rooftops, focusing on each other,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded, turning to stare out at what mostly amounted to a ring, loosely circling Fray\\u2019s building.\\xa0 I could see smoke here and there, and damage elsewhere.\\xa0 Muzzles flashed and fires periodically sprung up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t fast going, but I was fixated on the task.\\xa0 I checked every handhold and foothold as I scaled the blackened rubble.\\xa0 Some was still hot or warm to the touch.\\xa0 Other parts of it were slick with a mingling of damp and the film on the burned wood.</p>\\n<p>Once I was firmly on the rooftop, I stood straight, surveying the battlefield and the city beyond, squinting to try and make out what I could of the city at large.\\xa0 Rain streamed down through my hair and down my face.\\xa0 Refreshing and cold.\\xa0 Very, very cold.</p>\\n<p>The Brechwell Beast was close.</p>\\n<p>The others finished climbing up.\\xa0 Mary and I both gave Lillian a hand.\\xa0 Mary helped Jamie.</p>\\n<p>We ran as well as we were able, heads down, making sure to keep our balance where we could, skirting around a hole in the roof.</p>\\n<p>The nearest group of soldiers were aiming guns at us by the time I was able to see them.</p>\\n<p>Badge in hand, I held up my hands, slowing to a walk.</p>\\n<p>I could see the confusion on some of the soldier\\u2019s faces.\\xa0 I could see bodies strewn on the rooftop behind them, the furthest point from their front line.\\xa0 This was only the rear guard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTake me to your commander,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho the hell are you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t in the mood for this.\\xa0 I extended the badge in their direction.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m the only person here who knows <em>exactly</em> what\\u2019s going on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He took the badge, squinting at it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhile you\\u2019ve been shooting, the people you were supposed to be watching for got away.\\xa0 That building down there is empty now.\\xa0 Partially your fault, partially <em>ours</em>, but I want to remedy that.\\xa0 Take us to the person in charge.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay put,\\u201d he said, before turning to the other men.\\xa0 \\u201cWatch them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He took my badge away with him.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t like that.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t like standing still.\\xa0 I was very aware of the people behind me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d I said. \\u201cCan you help the wounded?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou stay put,\\u201d one of the soldiers said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd stay quiet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I closed my eyes.</p>\\n<p>That last part.\\xa0 The \\u2018stay quiet\\u2019.\\xa0 I appreciated that.</p>\\n<p>It meant I didn\\u2019t have to talk.\\xa0 Didn\\u2019t have to explain.</p>\\n<p>Mary and Lillian were huddled together, both wearing raincoats.\\xa0 They were talking.\\xa0 Saying a lot that I wasn\\u2019t privy to.</p>\\n<p>I doubted they had ever been closer.\\xa0 Mary doing what she\\u2019d done, for Lillian\\u2026</p>\\n<p>Even the fact that Mary had put her head on Gordon\\u2019s shoulder, that was something.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been gravitating towards him, a stiff arm\\u2019s-length relationship, she hadn\\u2019t <em>let</em> herself get close.</p>\\n<p>And then, all of a sudden, with Percy gone, she\\u2019d let down that guard.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d <em>decided</em>.\\xa0 Closure, something that had been agonizing her put to rest.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Jamie, who was staring off in the direction the others had gone, standing straight, hands in his pockets.\\xa0 Water had beaded his spectacles to the point I doubted he could see through them, but they were the reading type, easy enough to look over, with a change in the angle of his head.\\xa0 His hood was up, but his hair was still getting damp at the very ends of the very front.</p>\\n<p>Minutes passed.\\xa0 I was glad for the quiet.\\xa0 I was disappointed to see the soldier that had ordered us to stay quiet stepping away.</p>\\n<p>Well, perhaps not the worst thing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich way to the North Road?\\u201d I asked, breaking the silence.</p>\\n<p>There were no barked orders or threats.\\xa0 The other men were too cold, stressed, and scared to be bothered, it seemed.</p>\\n<p>Jamie glanced at me.\\xa0 Then he turned, taking in the city, and pointed.\\xa0 His finger traced a line, and I matched that line to the curve of one street.\\xa0 Now that I looked, it was twice as wide as the others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy, are you sure she went that way?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cFray could have deceived us, said one thing, while planning another.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen under that much stress?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 At most, she\\u2019s expecting us to expect that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s gone quiet,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I looked at him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe gunfire from that end.\\xa0 It\\u2019s faltering.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlready?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s Ashton\\u2019s specialty,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes that mean you\\u2019re going to adjust how you operate again?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, with a heavy heart.\\xa0 \\u201cNo need, not yet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou,\\u201d a soldier spoke behind me.</p>\\n<p>Mary and Lillian stood.\\xa0 Jamie and I turned.</p>\\n<p>It was the officer we\\u2019d spoken to earlier.\\xa0 He was with another man, blond, young, and wearing a very ornate outfit with less decoration on the breast.\\xa0 Less medals, less accomplishments.</p>\\n<p>The most hated man in Brechwell?</p>\\n<p>I took my badge back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes this man serve under anyone but you?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>The blond man raised his eyebrows.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen he helped instigate this infighting,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I saw the man\\u2019s expression change, and in that flicker of surprise, I knew I was right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe <em>what?</em>\\u201d the Headmaster General asked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy colleagues are already rounding up one or two of the others.\\xa0 We\\u2019re about to find out half of the superweapons are gone, if not more,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWorking with the enemy.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll explain in time.\\xa0 For now, I would recommend arresting him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Headmaster General looked at the man, who was turning red, visible even in the rain and the gloom.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLies,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t flinch, only waited.</p>\\n<p>Everyone wanted something, everyone had a weakness.\\xa0 I\\u2019d identified <em>Brechwell\\u2019s </em>weakness fairly soon after visiting.\\xa0 Which reminded me\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe helped goad the friendly fire, he helped enemy forces slip through and operate unnoticed, and I wouldn\\u2019t be surprised if he helped let the people through when the Academy was set on fire, or changed what was stored where, to help the flames spread,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe fighting has stopped,\\u201d Jamie said, just behind me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can hear there aren\\u2019t as many bullets being fired, and the explosions are slowing down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou lose nothing by arresting him now,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cQuestion him later, after facts have come to light.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll find he\\u2019s trying to make you look bad.\\xa0 You can blame us if we\\u2019re wrong, and take the credit if we\\u2019re right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man\\u2019s face was getting redder still.\\xa0 For all that people seemed to hate him, the Headmaster General seemed to be holding his composure.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cArrest him,\\u201d he ordered the men.</p>\\n<p>There wasn\\u2019t a fight.\\xa0 Face red, glaring, the man was quickly seized by four lesser officers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope you\\u2019re right,\\u201d the Headmaster General said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s another part to this.\\xa0 The allied forces and reinforcements are coming from the southwest, primarily?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe enemy is gone, they\\u2019re making a run for it.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s make life harder for them, or see if we can\\u2019t reveal some more of your traitors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave the men in the towers direct the Brechwell Beast along the North Road.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He stared at me, analyzing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf people in the towers shoot to change or confuse its course, then you know they\\u2019re on her side.\\xa0 You can\\u2019t have people like that at your Academy while you rebuild,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The Headmaster General nodded.\\xa0 He leaned close to one of the remaining officers, whispering orders, and then sent the man scampering off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m staying with you, until this is all resolved,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s as resolved as it will get,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe pick up the pieces, now, and pay mind to the aftermath.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t fast, the transmission of orders, or the initial movement of the Beast.\\xa0 Despite his promise to stay with us, the General stepped away to coordinate the passing on of messages.</p>\\n<p>Jamie pointed the way, figuring out the routes Fray might have taken, the places she could be, assuming she was making a beeline for freedom.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis won\\u2019t stop her,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cA surprise attack by the Brechwell Beast?\\xa0 It won\\u2019t remove her from the picture, she\\u2019s too canny.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHer?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 But she has a small army with her.\\xa0 Can <em>all</em> of them get to cover?\\xa0 There\\u2019s got to be an inverse to the cats and cockroaches principle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have one,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou need one,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAlways count on <em>some</em> degree of incompetence, in a sufficiently large group.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Brechwell Beast was moving.\\xa0 Picking up speed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s on the North Road,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>It had been quiet too long, my focus elsewhere.\\xa0 The sound of his voice made my heart leap, then fall three times as far as it had risen.</p>\\n<p>I had never missed my best friend more.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLowering its head,\\u201d the General said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt spotted something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It took three seconds.\\xa0 One attack.</p>\\n<p>Then the Beast continued on its way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re done,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNothing more we can accomplish here.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s go find the others.\\xa0 You can break the news to them, Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe news?\\u201d he asked, eyebrows raised.</p>\\n<p>My heart was heavy.\\xa0 \\u201cI know.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve figured it out, why they would go for Ashton and not Evette.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, yes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRedundancy,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cTwo social manipulators, two people who can fight.\\xa0 Why?\\xa0 Think about it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m thinking about it, but, they don\\u2019t expect any of us to die?\\xa0 Or are they- they\\u2019re not canceling a project?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could hear the alarm in her voice.\\xa0 I could see the relief as I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>A few \\u2018pops\\u2019 of gunfire suggested that things hadn\\u2019t entirely settled down in Brechwell.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re going to split up the Lambs.\\xa0 Or at least prepare for it to happen soon,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/11/19/tooth-and-nail-7-12/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>I could feel the soreness from the previous night as I ascended a ladder for the whateverth time.\\xa0 Up roughly four stories, shoes and hands slipping on wet, cold metal rungs.\\xa0 Each time, there was that precarious moment where I had to transfer over onto the roof, letting go of the ladder and putting my weight firmly on a slanted surface.</p>\\n<p>Gently slanted, but all the same, it didn\\u2019t leave much room for maneuvering or catching myself.</p>\\n<p>Eyes were focused on me as I stepped onto the roof.\\xa0 Men and boys in uniform, some only a couple of years older than me, some middle-aged, were giving me the once-over, smirking, and murmuring to their buddies.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d been getting those looks and smirks for a while yet.\\xa0 Approaching this perimeter, we\\u2019d ended up practically swimming in soldiers and cadets, along with other civilians who were making their belated evacuation from the area.\\xa0 It had been hard to make headway and harder still to talk about sensitive matters, and the irritation of those two things was compounded by the smug and condescending attention we\\u2019d gotten.</p>\\n<p>They were frustrated, stupid military cadets who\\u2019d had it drilled into their head that society was all about <em>hierarchies</em>, and they saw an easier target in us, a way to relieve tension and stress.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNice gun,\\u201d one commented.</p>\\n<p>I touched the rifle I\\u2019d slung over my back, and declined to respond.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGuy your size, you\\u2019re going to shoot that thing and the recoil will send you flying off the roof.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The soldiers in the area broke into laughter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen they said we\\u2019d have more people coming to help today, I thought the help would be <em>bigger</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>More laughter.</p>\\n<p>Gordon got off the ladder behind me, offering a hand to Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA girl with a rifle, now!\\u201d the comedian commented.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you know which way to hold that thing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That was worth a chuckle from the gallery.\\xa0 Kind of sad, really.\\xa0 He had the ear of everyone nearby, and that was all he could do?\\xa0 A wittier person could have had them laughing uproariously.</p>\\n<p>Mary gave me a sidelong glance.\\xa0 I kept my mouth closed, standing at ease as we waited for Helen and Lillian.\\xa0 She took my lead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey just keep coming.\\xa0 Look at that!\\xa0 Hello beautiful!\\xa0 You brought your dog?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Light chuckles, this time.\\xa0 Bored soldiers, amused at an odd scene of children visiting the\\u2026 I wasn\\u2019t even sure what to call it.\\xa0 The inverse of the trenches.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood boy,\\u201d Helen murmured, as she put Hubris down.\\xa0 She glanced down at Lillian.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on here?\\u201d a man asked.\\xa0 He stalked toward us, moving with surprising ease on the rooftop.\\xa0 He had an officer\\u2019s coat and two medals on one side of his jacket, a helmet tucked under one arm, clearly not yet worn as his black hair was oiled and slicked back.\\xa0 Spectacles were perched on his nose.</p>\\n<p>Not high ranked.\\xa0 A half-step above a captain?\\xa0 I could remember when the ranks had been neat and ordered, but special cases came and went, sub-ratings and capabilities, like Academy training and a core understanding of the types and dangers of superweapons, or the ability to manage stitched.\\xa0 In a place like Brechwell, I imagined it was worse.\\xa0 Teaching officers and non-teaching officers, to complicate things further.</p>\\n<p>Rather than answer the man, Gordon withdrew a badge from the coat of his raincoat, and handed it to the man.</p>\\n<p>I was willing to let him take point here.\\xa0 It conveyed a better picture, as fun as it might be to toy with phrasing and really drive the point home.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d the man murmured, taking the badge and opening it up.\\xa0 It was a little bit of silver with a leather flap to back it, and the latest version had writing inlaid in the leather, visible if the metal was lifted up.\\xa0 I had no idea how Gordon\\u2019s was legible \\u2013 mine had so much wear and tear that most of the lettering had flaked off.</p>\\n<p>We waited patiently.\\xa0 The joker and the other soldiers had fallen silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you look over there,\\u201d the officer pointed.\\xa0 \\u201cThe autonomous weapons are gathered over there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see them,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI trust your accommodations were suitable?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, thank you,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf there\\u2019s anything you need, I can relay your requests to the Major.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe may take you up on that,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere can we find you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m looking after several groups.\\xa0 Ask anyone here, they\\u2019ll know where to find me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, sir,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Navigation across the roof was treacherous, as groups were now camped out.\\xa0 The little rises where the roof extended over windows were flatter than the rest, and served as points to congregate, with sandbags and weapon emplacements set down, and soldiers clustering there, so close together that knees and shoulders touched.\\xa0 In other places, men with guns and binoculars were sitting on the roof\\u2019s peak, normally the easiest ground to tread on.</p>\\n<p>It struck me that the way the city was laid out made it easy to set a perimeter around a given location.\\xa0 Pick any point in the city, and the constantly curving and looping streets allowed a circle to be established, with relatively few gaps.</p>\\n<p>There <em>were</em> gaps here.\\xa0 Fray\\u2019s destruction had opened several, and I could see the distant shapes of people and emplacements on distant rooftops, covering those gaps.\\xa0 Less effective than a 12-metre wall with gunmen perched on top might be.</p>\\n<p>With the streets being wider hereabouts, there was more room for Fray\\u2019s group to move around if and when they stepped out of the building, but less cover.\\xa0 Some of those streets had scorch marks and craters.\\xa0 There had been artillery fire in the night.\\xa0 Some had been close to the building.</p>\\n<p>Scaring her people, keeping them off balance.\\xa0 It was good.\\xa0 A night without sleep, staring out windows and looking for signals from their double agents in our midst that something was going to happen, rattled by periodic artillery fire, wondering if <em>that</em> was the blast that preceded an attack, knocked down a wall, or wiped out a group of defenders.</p>\\n<p>I imagined Fray was very calm and collected throughout, but I had to wonder about Cynthia, who\\u2019d seemed shorter on temper, and about Mauer, who was a soldier, intimately familiar with these situations and this kind of pressure.</p>\\n<p>A crack and explosion made me think someone had fired an artillery shell.\\xa0 Instead, as I looked to the source, I saw the Brechwell Beast.\\xa0 I looked at its routes.\\xa0 To get to Fray, it would have to travel for two minutes down one path, decide to turn down one path instead of continuing forward through a hole in a series of houses, turn right, and decide to turn left instead of taking the more convenient \\u2018forward\\u2019 path.</p>\\n<p>I was willing to bet it was designed to go forward when it had a choice.\\xa0 Were there other aspects to it?\\xa0 It couldn\\u2019t be solely limited to the city.\\xa0 If they sought to bring it to bear in a confrontation outside of the city, how did they pilot it?\\xa0 Were there ways it could be exploited?</p>\\n<p>Gordon raised a hand.\\xa0 <em>Stop.</em></p>\\n<p>We all, Hubris included, came to a stop.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is our best and possibly last chance to talk without being overheard,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I looked back, then further down the length of rooftop.\\xa0 It was true; there was a wider gap than before, between the soldiers and artillery emplacement about seventy-five paces behind us and the group of Academy weapons about seventy-five paces ahead of us.\\xa0 Provided we didn\\u2019t raise our voice, there wasn\\u2019t much chance we\\u2019d be overheard.</p>\\n<p>I saw Dog and Catcher among the Academy weapons and mentally revised my estimate.</p>\\n<p>I raised my hand in a pair of signals I was pretty sure Catcher didn\\u2019t know.\\xa0 <em>Subtle \\u2013 careful \\u2013 speak.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Watch your words</em>.</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had a chance to think.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve got eyes on the situation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There are squads of soldiers stationed every fifty paces, except for here, and any enemy that attacks <em>this</em> part of the wall is going to be sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Dog, Catcher, the Engineer, the Wry Man, others I didn\\u2019t recognize.\\xa0 No shortage of weapons who could and would extract said apologies from errant enemies.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFrom my guess, we used the attic windows to access the roof,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think anyone is up to carrying sandbags and mortars up ladders.\\xa0 If we\\u2019re going to get to Fray, that means going down through the house, crossing the open plaza with two hundred eyes on us.\\xa0 From there, depending on where we exited from, there is another expanse of open space with even more eyes on us before we can reach her place, <em>or</em> we have to get around a row of houses on the way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we get <em>seen</em>, it reflects badly on us,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cProblematic, whatever route we take.\\xa0 But I want to get in there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich is another thing we need to think about, the route we take\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ve said your piece, Lillian and you have very different ideas on what the ramifications might be.\\xa0 Now, keep in mind\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hand signs.\\xa0 <em>Subtle.\\xa0 Careful.\\xa0 Speak.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are we thinking?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to talk to Percy,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 Her eyes were focused on Fray\\u2019s building.\\xa0 \\u201cI want to ask him things, <em>why</em>, and how much of what he told me was true.\\xa0 I want closure, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy reasons are bad.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not in tune with the mission.\\xa0 It\\u2019s for <em>me</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not a bad thing,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is when we\\u2019re here, and there\\u2019s this much going on,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe closure I want\\u2026 I\\u2019m not sure it isn\\u2019t me sticking a knife between Percy\\u2019s ribs.\\xa0 But I\\u2019m not sure it <em>is</em>, either.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be a poetic end,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cTo be killed by your own creation.\\xa0 There\\u2019s probably a Latin term for it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Jamie would know</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay, Mary doesn\\u2019t think we should do this.\\xa0 Does that mean we start thinking about other approaches?\\xa0 Arguments that could convince Mary or Lillian?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPercy\\xa0 killed the mice to make ghosts,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cTime and again, he preys on the vulnerable.\\xa0 The Mary before Mary, rendered into fodder for experimentation by\\u2026 it would have had to be Cynthia\\u2019s group.\\xa0 Sometimes it feels pathological.\\xa0 The way he preys on children.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t know your feelings on the subject were so strong,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t make eye contact with the others, because admitting to a more personal vendetta against someone, a <em>justification,</em> it felt wrong, awkward, doubly so because I was speaking it aloud.\\xa0 I crouched, straddling the peak of the roof, one hand fidgeting at my knee.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry, Mary, to say all that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, Sy.\\xa0 It\\u2019s fine.\\xa0 I want you to say it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t think it was fine, but I didn\\u2019t say so.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s a <em>fox</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I ran my finger down the outside of my raincoat, collecting water droplets, and drew out the symbol on my knee.\\xa0 There wasn\\u2019t enough moisture, so it barely worked.\\xa0 A series of blobs and lines instead of a proper triangle with two little triangles for ears.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we move forward with my plan, what I\\u2019m arguing for, it doesn\\u2019t rule out working out how to remove Percy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>At my knee, my hand made a gesture.\\xa0 <em>Speak</em>.</p>\\n<p>I looked up, and the others were looking down at me.\\xa0 No signs to ask for clarification.\\xa0 I trusted they understood what I was saying.</p>\\n<p><em>We talk to Fray, and we make a deal, where Percy gets removed from the picture, in exchange for our help.</em></p>\\n<p>I ventured, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how that works for you, Mary.\\xa0 I know there\\u2019s the emotional component.\\xa0 He was-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe <em>is</em> my father,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy maker.\\xa0 Everything I am, just about everything and every skill I\\u2019m proud of, he gave me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A knife had appeared in her hand, blade resting between two fingers, handle extended back over her knuckles and the back of her hand.\\xa0\\xa0 She rolled it along her fingers until it fell off the side, let it fall, and caught the pommel.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re running out of time,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe discussion with Fray won\\u2019t be short, and things get more complicated when the reinforcements arrive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>When the new Lamb arrives</em>.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d spent so long so committed to the Lambs, living and dead.\\xa0 Now, as I thought about the new member joining, I couldn\\u2019t be sure where I stood.\\xa0 I felt more disassociated than attached.\\xa0 An unfamiliar feeling not unlike nervousness had settled in my chest and it felt very ugly and very negative.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe plan on the most basic level has to happen,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhatever we\\u2019re doing, we <em>need</em> to get in there.\\xa0 We get close, we do our thing with Fray, I have ideas on how we get out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I signaled the half truth, my fidgeting hand at my knee.</p>\\n<p><em>I need those books back.\\xa0 Mary needs to talk to Percy.\\xa0 </em></p>\\n<p>An artillery shell fired, distant.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t hit the building, instead hitting the street.\\xa0 Only a few nearby windows were intact or mostly intact, and they shattered with the force of the explosion.\\xa0 A plume of dust and smoke was kicked up, only to get beaten down by the rain.</p>\\n<p>I watched it, studying.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe might have to decide on a plan as we act.\\xa0 Come to a decision <em>there</em>.\\xa0 Decide on our own,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t like that,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat includes making a decision on Percy,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf anyone doesn\\u2019t want to move forward, if Mary wants to spare Percy, then we retreat here.\\xa0 Pretend we never left.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Mary said, but she said it in a way that sounded like she was actually considering it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to lose you,\\u201d I said, not looking at her.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to lose Lillian.\\xa0 I swear to you, on my membership in the Lambs, that I\\u2019m not going to manipulate you when it comes down to the decision.\\xa0 We get close, then we decide on a course of action.\\xa0 But we can\\u2019t stay here, we can\\u2019t just sit and wait and let things unfold.\\xa0 That serves nobody and no-one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI agree,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m on the fence about this, I need to know more before we make a call.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian was only shaking her head, a small gesture, nervous.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know you have commitments to the Academy,\\u201d Gordon said, his voice soft.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 And to the people,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cTo my <em>family</em>.\\xa0 I might only see them once or twice a year, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon signaled.\\xa0 Stop.</p>\\n<p>Lillian shut her mouth.</p>\\n<p>He shifted the signal to <em>careful</em>.\\xa0 <em>Listen</em>.</p>\\n<p>The gesture for <em>listen</em> was loose, fingers unfolding to indicate the general area.\\xa0 Listening ears.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t do this,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease believe me.\\xa0 It would be\\u2026 so horrible.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fray\\u2019s release of the books, made out to be an apocalyptic event.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you want to stay behind?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo!\\xa0 I want- I want to\\u2026 I <em>need</em> to know that the Lambs are who I thought they were.\\xa0 That they understand, and when it matters, they take me at my word, about the very things I\\u2019ve studied.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that because what you studied is right and real, Lil, or is it propaganda?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>She whirled on me, as upset as I\\u2019d ever seen her.\\xa0 \\u201cYou <em>just</em> promised, Sy.\\xa0 You wouldn\\u2019t manipulate me.\\xa0 <em>That\\u2019s</em> manipulation.\\xa0 What you just did.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, very calm.\\xa0 \\u201cManipulation would be pointing out how you getting upset right now is telling, and that you\\u2019re more insecure than you\\u2019re letting on.\\xa0 My promise was in regards to when we were there, deciding.\\xa0 At the pivotal moment.\\xa0 Not here.\\xa0 Here I\\u2019m going to argue my case.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d she said, and her voice was terse.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m fond of you, I\\u2019m fond of every one of the Lambs.\\xa0 But I have parents to think about, I have aunts, uncles, and cousins.\\xa0 I have <em>dreams,</em> and if you want to risk <em>everything </em>so you can make a grand dramatic play, then I\\u2019m saying <em>no</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Another artillery shell came down.\\xa0 It was on the far side of the building.\\xa0 I heard something crack and crumble, but the soldiers around the perimeter didn\\u2019t act like it was anything special.\\xa0 A close call.</p>\\n<p>There were no underground tunnels, supposedly.\\xa0 Fray couldn\\u2019t fly.\\xa0 A literal army surrounded her.\\xa0 I imagined the Academy forces saw it as an easy victory, a bird in the hand.\\xa0 They could let the train come with the monsters, and use only the expendable assets to eliminate the enemy.\\xa0 Only stitched and superweapons.</p>\\n<p>It had to be eleven thirty or thereabouts.\\xa0 An hour and a half, and the reinforcements would arrive.\\xa0 Those huddled men taking cover under canvas and by sandbag were probably discussing their strategy now.\\xa0 So easy to do.\\xa0 The way they <em>mingled</em>, sending men over this way and that under the premise of getting and sharing information, latrine breaks and grabbing quick bites to eat, they could be communicating a greater plan.</p>\\n<p>One signal, and there would be slaughter.\\xa0 Fray would play her gambit, and if I was right, the army here would turn on itself.\\xa0 Mortar shots fired at rooftops.\\xa0 A coordinated strike, removing the major players.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not about the play or doing anything fancy,\\u201d I said, as my ears stopped ringing from the recent explosions.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI heard what you said before.\\xa0 I know you\\u2019ve got justifications.\\xa0 But Sy, you\\u2019re smart enough that you\\u2019re going to come up with perfect, convincing reasons to do something you want to do, and you\\u2019re going to come up with perfect, convincing reasons <em>not</em> to do something you want to do.\\xa0 When Fray or Mauer or whoever else come into the picture, you get caught up in their gravitational pull, because they give you the ability to make your mark, to make bigger, clearer actions and bigger, clearer justifications to <em>do </em>those things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo, what?\\xa0 Does that make everything I say invalid?\\xa0 I\\u2019ll always have good-sounding reasons to do something or not do something?\\xa0 My rationale doesn\\u2019t matter?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt breaks down to what Gordon was trying to get at last night.\\xa0 The root of the issue.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to play twenty questions again, are we?\\xa0 Because the way you guys play, <em>Gordon</em> plays, is to ask the same question twenty times.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to grill you.\\xa0 That\\u2019s not what I\\u2019m getting at.\\xa0 I just think\\u2026 we\\u2019re walking into the lion\\u2019s den, and I don\\u2019t know how we\\u2019re getting in or out, or if I like the Lambs going there when I know I won\\u2019t like what I hear.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know how we\\u2019re getting in,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen\\u2026 wait, what time is it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHold on,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She reached into a pocket, and pulled out a pocket watch without a chain.\\xa0 \\u201cEleven forty.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, Helen, run a quick errand.\\xa0 Tell the nearest artillery team to drop a shell between the ensconced building entrance down there, and the shop under us here.\\xa0 Then further out, same thing, but between the building entrance and Fray\\u2019s building.\\xa0 You see what I mean?\\xa0 \\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey shoot at eleven-fifty, eleven-fifty-two, as fast as they can load a shell and fire again, then do it in reverse, at twelve-twenty and twelve twenty-two.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Then she was off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCover of smoke and debris?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cA lot of ground to cover.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can make it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf Fray delays us\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe won\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re sure?\\xa0 Because-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe won\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cTrust me.\\xa0 She won\\u2019t have a choice in the matter.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon frowned at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrust me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cAs much as I trust anyone.\\xa0 But I\\u2019m an old man, Sy.\\xa0 Trusting you isn\\u2019t good for a weak heart like mine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t joke,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He gave me a slight smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know what you\\u2019re doing,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cTen minutes, you scheduled us to leave.\\xa0 You\\u2019re setting a time limit, putting pressure on me.\\xa0 I pay attention, Sy.\\xa0 I\\u2019m a good student.\\xa0 It\\u2019s why I\\u2019m here!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not what I\\u2019m doing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow that she points it out, it sounds like she\\u2019s right on the mark,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p><em>Not you too!</em></p>\\n<p>Before I could open my mouth, Lillian was on me.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s like you\\u2019re an abusive husband, you act mean, you tease, you taunt, you manipulate, then you start saying and doing all the right things, you lure me back in, you make me let my guard down-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Husband</em> is a little bit forward, I think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo!\\xa0 No jokes, no teasing, no manipulation.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry I\\u2019m not cooperating, and this apology is for Gordon and Mary and Hubris and Helen who isn\\u2019t here, but no.\\xa0 You\\u2019re not going to budge me.\\xa0 The only way to win against Sy for sure is to not play his games.\\xa0 I\\u2019m staying right here.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not coming, and if you leave, I\\u2019m going straight to the people in charge and telling them what\\u2019s happening.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed.</p>\\n<p>Lillian folded her arms.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven if it kills us?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you do this, if you\\u2019re really considering this, you\\u2019re dead to me,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I could see from her expression that that wasn\\u2019t true in the slightest.\\xa0 That it killed her to say.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d I said, and I dropped my voice to a whisper, stepping closer.\\xa0 I reached out to pull her hands free and take them in mine, and she refused to give them to me.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s going to make this happen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot with our help,\\u201d Lillian whispered to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI saw their setup,\\u201d I said, \\u201cOkay?\\xa0 Where their stuff is.\\xa0 I know where the labs are, <em>you</em> know what\\u2019s flammable.\\xa0 No grand plays, nothing fancy, we get over there, Mary gets to confront Percy, I get to hunt for the books, we burn them out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>All lies.</p>\\n<p>With all the strength I could muster, I pulled one of Lillian\\u2019s hands away from her arm.\\xa0 I clasped her wrist, and put my hand in hers, palm up.</p>\\n<p>I signaled.\\xa0 <em>Ruse</em>.</p>\\n<p>Her eyes narrowed.</p>\\n<p>I looked over my shoulder at Gordon and Mary.\\xa0 They\\u2019d seen the gesture.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t trust you,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re doing this,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have long.\\xa0 Come on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen was already on her way back.</p>\\n<p>I had Lillian\\u2019s wrist.\\xa0 I pulled her behind me.</p>\\n<p>In through the access window that let us into the attic of the building.</p>\\n<p>The hatch leading from the attic to the building below was locked.\\xa0 I got my lockpicks out, but Mary pushed me aside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrust me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t a hard lock to open.\\xa0 Less than a minute\\u2019s time.\\xa0 The hatches were common to every attic in the area, and the <em>real</em> purpose was to delay invaders, they could afford to be cheap.</p>\\n<p>The building was a set of offices, smelling strongly of cigarette smoke and firewood.\\xa0 We were quickly down the stairs to the third floor, then the second.</p>\\n<p>I stopped.\\xa0 The others, intent on continuing down to the first, bumped into me.\\xa0 I stopped them.</p>\\n<p>I raised a finger to my lips, and led the others to the window.\\xa0 Still pulling Lillian behind me, I crouched there.</p>\\n<p>My fingers tapped Lillian\\u2019s pocket.\\xa0 She withdrew her pocket watch.</p>\\n<p>Two minutes until.</p>\\n<p>Crouching, hands over my ears, I waited, the others with me.</p>\\n<p>The explosion rocked the building, knocking me on my ass.\\xa0 Gordon\\u2019s hand kept the bayonet blade of my rifle from stabbing Mary.\\xa0 They helped support me.\\xa0 I watched the plume of smoke, then looked to either side, studying the surroundings.</p>\\n<p>The next explosion came before the debris from the first had cleared.\\xa0 Easier to bear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s-\\u201d Gordon started.</p>\\n<p>I put a finger out, shushing him.</p>\\n<p>The retaliation from the rebels came shortly after.\\xa0 A band of stitched, carrying heavy rifles.\\xa0 The rifles of the people at the perimeter and the rifles of the stitched didn\\u2019t quite reach each other, with intervening buildings and everything else.\\xa0 They were firing at people on the rooftops.</p>\\n<p><em>How does this work?</em></p>\\n<p>A horn, as it turned out.\\xa0 It blared from above.</p>\\n<p><em>And who?</em></p>\\n<p>My heart sank as I saw.\\xa0 Dog and Catcher reached the ground level in record time.\\xa0 They plowed into the group of stitched.</p>\\n<p>One stitched ran back toward Fray\\u2019s building, dropping the weapon and disappearing into the smoke.</p>\\n<p>I held up my fingers, counting.</p>\\n<p>One.\\xa0 Two.\\xa0 Three.\\xa0 Four\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy?\\u201d Gordon asked, noting the fingers.</p>\\n<p>Eight.\\xa0 Nine.\\xa0 Ten.\\xa0 Eleven\\u2026</p>\\n<p>Twenty seconds in all passed before Catcher returned, his quarry in his mancatcher\\u2019s grasp.\\xa0 The smoke was clearing, and as it did, he picked up the pace, running for cover, snapping the stitched\\u2019s neck and tearing head from shoulders with a movement of the mancatcher.</p>\\n<p>He passed out of our field of vision.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou expected that,\\u201d Gordon said, voice quiet.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t understand,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t the plan to cross over and wing it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI suspected we were being watched or listened to.\\xa0 I wanted them to think we were coming.\\xa0 Fray\\u2019s mole, if she had any, would want to pass on information about us sabotaging her, blowing up labs, the fact our group was split.\\xa0 The trick was to give them a reason and an opportunity.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at each of the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf they didn\\u2019t have a mole, nothing lost, we talk it through and schedule another crossing.\\xa0 If they <em>did</em>, then maybe something like that happens.\\xa0 A signal, asking for a reason to go down to ground level.\\xa0 Dog and Catcher signal they\\u2019re going down, dispatch expendable troops, and relay a message, while they think we\\u2019re not

Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, I couldn\\u2019t tell through the back of your head.\\xa0 Can you wake Sy up?\\xa0 Make sure he gets out of bed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I winced, but played at being asleep.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI will.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I peeked and saw the door starting to close.\\xa0 It stopped.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian stirred, the arm and leg that were draped over me pulling away.\\xa0 As she turned over, she made the covers pull away from me.\\xa0 I tugged them sharply back into place, which inadvertently pulled her closer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUrm- Yes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you doing okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know we can get a little focused on the mission, on other things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know you\\u2019re pointing at me,\\u201d I mumbled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, you\\u2019re awake.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want to lose sight of the details, Lillian.\\xa0 I thought I\\u2019d ask.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m a detail?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a Lamb.\\xa0 Details come part and parcel.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a pause.\\xa0 Lillian shifted position, but didn\\u2019t get up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m okay.\\xa0 Thank you for asking, Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright.\\xa0 We\\u2019re eating downstairs.\\xa0 There are a lot of soldiers in the building, so you might want to get dressed before coming down.\\xa0 Are you good to wear yesterday\\u2019s clothes, or should I send Mary with-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m okay, Gordon.\\xa0 I brought clothes for today.\\xa0 Thank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>The door shut.</p>\\n<p>I turned over, until I was on my back.\\xa0 I looked at the back of Lillian\\u2019s head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe cares about you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike you\\u2019re a little sister, sort of.\\xa0 He likes Mary, or <em>could</em> like Mary if he let himself, but he thinks it\\u2019s wrong to do anything when he might not have much time left.\\xa0 Mary, meanwhile, isn\\u2019t making any direct moves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary likes you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary likes Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian turned over.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe, but she likes you too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her face was just a couple of inches from mine, one arm folded under her head.\\xa0 She was sharing the same pillow as me, and her arm being where it was meant her head didn\\u2019t slide off the end.\\xa0 Her hair wasn\\u2019t even shoulder length when left loose, but it was bound in a ponytail for sleeping, which made it seem shorter, and hairs had come free in the night, laying across her temple and cheek.</p>\\n<p>It reminded me of Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe might.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like Mary,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you and she did-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was already shaking my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy not?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think she was made to follow orders, she clung to someone and obeyed them and conformed herself to them,\\u201d I said, my voice quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo Percy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 To Percy.\\xa0 I think\\u2026 she\\u2019s courting herself, in a way, if that makes sense?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian shook her head, face pressing momentarily against the pillow, \\u201cI don\\u2019t get it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s still figuring herself out, after, what, nearly two years?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpring of the year before last.\\xa0 Yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd when she first got here, she was insecure, she was dangerous, and I spent some time steering her in the right directions, watching her, coaxing her out of her shell.\\xa0 Controlling her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re worried that if she gets close to you, it\\u2019s going to be moving backward?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Smart girl.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think Gordon is better for Mary and Mary is better for Gordon than I am for Mary or Mary for me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat makes sense,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah?\\xa0 Because I\\u2019m not sure I didn\\u2019t get words mixed around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt did.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m a little worried about what happens when and if she talks with Percy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t be,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s my friend, she\\u2019s close to us.\\xa0 She understands.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope you\\u2019re right,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t say it, but I suspected Lillian didn\\u2019t know just what Mary might find out if she talked to Percy.</p>\\n<p>Lillian gave me a half-smile.\\xa0 \\u201cIf that\\u2019s your reasoning about them, and if it won\\u2019t bother you, I\\u2019m on your side.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll back you in this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I yawned, hand over my mouth, then settled my head back on the pillow.</p>\\n<p>It was cold outside, warm under the covers, and a part of me didn\\u2019t want to face what the day had in store.\\xa0 A second part of me was a little worried about how much the <em>third</em> part of me wanted to meet the day head on.</p>\\n<p>Mary had a way of looking imperious or hawkish, almost as if her expression was on the verge of being an angry one, but it never actually contorted with the actual emotion.\\xa0 When she felt the need to soften the expression, Mary had a way of becoming more ladylike.\\xa0 It was rare that her back wasn\\u2019t straight, her eyes focused forward.\\xa0 Wavy brown hair pulled back and tied into place with ribbons seemed somehow fitting.\\xa0 Something elemental and natural bound into a set form.\\xa0 Get too close, and it was starched collars, hems and lace that I\\u2019d joked could cut a man.\\xa0 Beneath that was razor wire and hidden blades.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was more of a mouse than a hawk in demeanor.\\xa0 Not as visually arresting, nervous, but warmer.\\xa0 When she had her hair cut, I suspected at least some thought went into what was easiest to manage, so she could spend less time getting up in the morning.\\xa0 She\\u2019d grown it longer in recent months, despite having more access to the hairdresser, and I imagined it was the influence of the other girls, a growing awareness of herself.\\xa0 Straight brown hair curled out at the end.\\xa0 She bloomed late, but where Helen was a flower tended by another, the inner workings almost entirely separate, and where Mary\\u2019s inner and outer self image were inexorably intertwined and carefully honed, I imagined that Lillian was becoming a real <em>girl, </em>but it was on her terms, only permitted when it didn\\u2019t interfere with other work.\\xa0 It would be a slow, halting progression.</p>\\n<p>I could see her as an adult woman, <em>respectable, </em>but not fashionable.\\xa0 Always a few steps behind the times, or too inclined to fall back on staples and safe bets, with only a few allowances to real femininity, like her hair was becoming now.</p>\\n<p>She had an expiry date too.\\xa0 Not an official one, not one that would see her dead before twenty-two, but there would be a time when her studies would take priority, and she would be yanked from us.\\xa0 That woman I was imagining would watch from a distance as the last of the Lambs died.</p>\\n<p>I pulled away, pinched the covers down between us to trap the air and warmth on her side, and slipped out from my side of the bed.\\xa0 I stretched.</p>\\n<p>My luggage was in the corner.\\xa0 I opened the clasps and hauled it open, before collecting the clothes for the day.\\xa0 I draped each article of clothing over the open top of the luggage as I picked it out.</p>\\n<p>Yesterday\\u2019s clothes had gone to pieces.\\xa0 I picked the long-sleeved shirt, green-and-black checkered vest, dark slacks and wool socks, picking each with the thickest fabric in mind, and pulled out boots with straps at the top.\\xa0 I pulled off my pyjama top.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not looking,\\u201d Lillian announced.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood.\\xa0 Because naughty girls who peek will find out I have no shame, and I\\u2019m not above wagging it in front of your face.\\xa0 You can live with <em>that</em> mental image every time you look at me for the next few weeks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt- Sy, no!\\u201d she protested.\\xa0 She had her hands firmly over her eyes.</p>\\n<p>I dressed quickly, gathered my things, and made sure I had my pockets full of everything I might need.\\xa0 Badge, knife, pen, chalk, string, razor wire, knife and sheath for my boot, needles, and lockpicks.\\xa0 Not that I was very good with the picks.</p>\\n<p>Mary had influenced <em>us</em> too.\\xa0 Being prepared.\\xa0 Getting used to having everything we might need.</p>\\n<p>I hauled the window open, and looked out on the city.</p>\\n<p>Raining hard.\\xa0 I could see the hump of the Brechwell Beast\\u2019s back as it meandered down a street about a mile away.\\xa0 For it to be visible above the rooftops, it had either grown a size, or it was treading on rubble of a fallen structure.</p>\\n<p>Looking in the direction of Fray\\u2019s headquarters, I could see the irregular outlines of people or temporary constructions on the rooftops.\\xa0 Warbeasts, possibly sandbags, crowds.</p>\\n<p>The Beast hadn\\u2019t attacked Fray in the night.</p>\\n<p>I stuck my head out as far as I could manage, and let the runoff from the eaves above the window run over my head.\\xa0 I flipped over backward and let it spatter inconsistently across my face.</p>\\n<p>Climbing back inside, I shut the window and ran my fingers through my now-wet hair to comb out the worst of the tangles and pillow-hair.\\xa0 There was a tiny bit of grit from the runoff, but it hardly mattered.\\xa0 I pulled on a flat brimmed cap.</p>\\n<p>Lillian, lying there with hands over her eyes, looked so warm and dry, still covered by the blankets, enjoying exclusive use of the one pillow.\\xa0 The part of me that wanted to avoid the day called out, told me to cover my head so I didn\\u2019t soak the pillow and crawl beneath those covers once more.</p>\\n<p>But that part of me was getting smaller, my brain was starting to get up to speed with the challenges I was sure we were going to face, idle thoughts buzzing in the back of my mind, and I knew it wasn\\u2019t really an option.</p>\\n<p>Last night was the closest thing to a moment of weakness that I was allowed.\\xa0 I could have climbed under the covers and tried to hide from the world, I could have confessed insecurities and the others would probably have listened.\\xa0 We could have changed course or made excuses or delayed the day, and I might have been able to spend the day warm in bed, in the company of the Lambs.\\xa0 But the day after?\\xa0 The day after that?\\xa0 No.</p>\\n<p>It would weaken me, rather than strengthen me.\\xa0 Set me too far back.\\xa0 Set <em>us</em> too far back.</p>\\n<p>There was a mission.\\xa0 An enemy to be outsmarted, problems to solve, mysteries to see to their conclusion.\\xa0 It excited me.</p>\\n<p>A new Lamb to meet.</p>\\n<p>Not excitement as much as dread, there.</p>\\n<p>Lillian probably faced very similar dilemmas every single morning she was to accompany us, but I doubted the prospect of outsmarting someone like Fray or Mauer really drove her to get up and keep fighting forward.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou should hurry, as soon as I\\u2019m out the door,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to be the one keeping the Lambs waiting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m up earlier than any of you, every single day, Sy,\\u201d she told me, sounding annoyed.\\xa0 I was willing to bet the idea of being the slowpoke genuinely annoyed her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGotta tell you, Lil, <em>this</em> is not the day to start being lazy, wow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be ready!\\xa0 Just give me some privacy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause if you delay us, we\\u2019re totally going to secretly judge you, except for me, I\\u2019ll openly-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She reached over to the nightstand, picked up the first available item, a candlestick holder sans candlestick, and threw it in my general direction.\\xa0 It banged against the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLeave!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I touched the brim of my cap, bowing a little, saw her reach for the next available object, and hurried through, closing the door behind me.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was right.\\xa0 Soldiers were swarming the place.\\xa0 Many were young men, and some who weren\\u2019t hurrying from one place to another were here, in earshot of Lillian\\u2019s shout, giving me knowing grins and quirked eyebrows.\\xa0 Except I wasn\\u2019t exactly sure what they were being so smug or knowing about.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure I liked the idea of boys only three to five years older than me milling around and going about their business with Lillian alone in the other room.</p>\\n<p>I waited with my back to the door, both hands behind me on the knob and one foot tapping, for what must have been several minutes.\\xa0 I was about to poke my head inside and tell Lillian to hurry when the door opened, the doorknob slipping from my fingers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh!\\u201d she said, in surprise.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll set?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm.\\xa0 Bathroom,\\u201d she said, looking around the hallway.\\xa0 One of the young men across from us pointed.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t- don\\u2019t wait outside the bathroom door, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure how to respond to that, so I didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 I gave one glance to the young soldiers and headed downstairs.</p>\\n<p>The group had collected in one corner of the already small kitchen, Gordon and Mary sitting side by side in the windowsill, and Helen standing in one corner beside them.</p>\\n<p>Before I was even halfway down the stairs, Gordon used one toe to nudge a plate of mystery meat, eggs, and green stuff across the table.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou beat Lillian down here,\\u201d he commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLies and slander.\\xa0 Oh, you meant I\\u2019m first.\\xa0 Yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re in a better mood than yesterday,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cKeep that mood going.\\xa0 Eat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave her a mock salute, then grabbed a knife and fork and set to work on the plate, standing rather than sitting down.\\xa0 Soldiers were passing through behind me, and being on my feet made it easier to step out of the way.</p>\\n<p>Hubris put his paws up on the wall, head poking up between Mary and Gordon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTouch my right shoe, then Gordon\\u2019s left knee, then sniff the door, and bring me the umbrella,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Bemused, I watched as the dog went through the motions.\\xa0 Nose touched to Mary\\u2019s shoe, then Gordon\\u2019s knee, before it hopped down from the wall, rounded the table to touch nose to the door, pausing.\\xa0 It eased an umbrella out of the rack by the door and carried it over to Mary, being careful not to strike me in the back of the knees with the pointed end.</p>\\n<p>Mary took the umbrella, reached down to the windowsill beside her and picked up a bit of mystery meat, biting off a bit, then tossing the remainder to Hubris.</p>\\n<p>Lillian came downstairs, and before Gordon could toe the second plate in her direction, I reached out to pull it across the table.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSleep okay?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Lillian said, not making eye contact.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI slept okay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWoke up in the middle of the night, thought something was going on outside with the Brechwell Beast.\\xa0 Turned my thoughts over again and again and tried to figure out what I was hearing.\\xa0 Nope.\\xa0 Lillian snores.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs if,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cTry harder, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe does.\\xa0 You do,\\u201d Mary said, agreeing with me, then turning her focus to Lillian to restate it.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ve shared a room and had our sleepovers between missions.\\xa0 They\\u2019re <em>little</em> snores.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I grinned.\\xa0 \\u201cBut she snores.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian frowned, not sure how to process that.\\xa0 She turned and kicked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOw!\\xa0 Stop that, you brute.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re going to kick me, at least kick Mary too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary is <em>nice</em> about things like that,\\u201d Lillian sniffed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSince we\\u2019re all obviously aware of what\\u2019s going on and you\\u2019ve all talked about it, I feel the need to chime in.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know where you guys have gotten the idea I need this, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou mean where you start acting like you\\u2019ve just had an appointment but it\\u2019s only sleep deprivation?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOk, I\\u2019ll rephrase-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you saying you don\\u2019t like it?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 I put down my knife and fork, palms up, weighing, trying to find the words.</p>\\n<p>After a few seconds, I frowned and picked up the utensils, focusing on the food.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe likes it,\\u201d Helen decided.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s complicated,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think it\\u2019s very simple,\\u201d she told me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think I liked it better when you talked less.\\xa0 It\\u2019s complicated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon spoke up, \\u201cI\\u2019m more inclined to go with Sy than with Helen on this one.\\xa0 Complicated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I picked up my plate, three-quarters eaten, and carried it over to the sink.\\xa0 I stuck out my tongue at Helen, who was standing beside the sink, back to the wall.</p>\\n<p>She stuck out her tongue, kept it out, and moved her head closer to mine.\\xa0 I caught her tongue in between index finger and thumb.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSaw that coming.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMugh ah bahr,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>Her tongue continued to extend.\\xa0 I held the tip, but the middle section reached out, looping over my bent finger.\\xa0 I twisted my hand out of the way, but she was persistent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAaggh,\\u201d she said, when we\\u2019d reached a stalemate.\\xa0 Her hand went up and pressed against my forehead, coming away with a bit of grit on one fingertip.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I said, not letting go.\\xa0 \\u201cNo more licking.\\xa0 I know you got a taste of me last night.\\xa0 But we don\\u2019t do that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled and nodded.</p>\\n<p>I let her withdraw her tongue into her mouth and wiped my fingers off on my vest, heading back toward my seat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWash.\\xa0 Hands,\\u201d Lillian ordered me.</p>\\n<p>I grimaced.\\xa0 I grimaced again as I noticed the soap was the gritty bar kind of soap.\\xa0 The kind that left skin raw.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGetting back to the topic of the complicated, I don\\u2019t think we can put it off.\\xa0 We need to talk strategy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was focused on the sink rather than the group behind me, but I could imagine the tone of the room changing, a shift in the gravity, the attitudes, even the thought processes.</p>\\n<p>My own thoughts began changing in direction and focus.\\xa0 Plans of attack, where things stood, who was involved\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI took Hubris out first thing.\\xa0 Went by the train station.\\xa0 State of the city, the train schedules changed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My thoughts were momentarily derailed.\\xa0 I turned around, hands still soapy, and rather than rinse them, just wiped them on the dishcloth.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s a reason this is worth mentioning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEarly afternoon.\\xa0 From a strategic point of view, this is a good thing for the Academy, a bad thing for Fray.\\xa0 The weapons, soldiers, and reinforcements from Radham come en-masse.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat time is it now?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAn hour before noon.\\xa0 I thought you needed the extra sleep, and I figured you\\u2019d be awake half the night anyway.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did, and I would\\u2019ve been,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Now that I had a timeline in my head, the world was starting to make sense.\\xa0 \\u201cPerimeter still stands, Brechwell Beast didn\\u2019t attack Fray\\u2019s area.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s pinned down.\\xa0 But you think a large body of the people who have her pinned down are traitors?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I raised my hand, counting off on my fingers.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s the number one possibility.\\xa0 Number two is that she has someone pulling strings for her.\\xa0 She\\u2019s here because she\\u2019s working with whoever runs Brechwell.\\xa0 Who we suspect to be an incompetent ass.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe say that a little quieter,\\u201d Mary suggested.</p>\\n<p>I looked back over my shoulder.\\xa0 The soldiers were talking to their captain.\\xa0 \\u201cPshh.\\xa0 They know better than we do.\\xa0 But maybe we should talk outside, if Lillian\\u2019s done?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It took us a minute to get our things together.\\xa0 Mary deposited the umbrella by the door, and Helen had boots to pull on, while Gordon was quick to get his things on, stepping into another room before returning with the rifles we\\u2019d claimed earlier.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFeel confident?\\u201d he asked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow many bullets?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy pockets are full.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen gimme,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cGive me a minute to practice shooting, I\\u2019ll be able to hit the mark every time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t inspire confidence,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>But I still got the third rifle.\\xa0 Gordon took one, and Mary took another.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re restricting travel through the city.\\xa0 Be prepared to get stopped,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I checked my pocket.\\xa0 I had the badge.</p>\\n<p>We stepped out into the rain.\\xa0 It was less crowded outdoors, the streets largely vacant.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were saying, Sy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRemind me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoint one, she\\u2019s confident because she has the strength on her side.\\xa0 Point two-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cConnections.\\xa0 Hard to buy, knowing what I know.\\xa0 Third tool for major engagements is resources.\\xa0 Wealth?\\xa0 How much money do you need to buy your way out of <em>that</em>?\\xa0 Things others want that could earn leverage?\\xa0 I don\\u2019t see it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStrength, connections, resources,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFour, devices.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been thinking hard, trying not to overlook anything like we overlooked the water in, uh-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKensford,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s a vector or a complication like that, not here.\\xa0 Which leads to devices part B.\\xa0 Weapons, chemicals, bombs, traps.\\xa0 Does she have a weapon so strong that it threatens to wipe out the opposition here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not impossible,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA weapon of her <em>own</em>?\\xa0 Not taken from either group?\\xa0 She needs to show strength to properly unite them under her banner.\\xa0 Keep in mind she\\u2019s only had about a year, she\\u2019s been focused on other things, setting this up, preparing the books she plans to distribute.\\xa0 Now it\\u2019s possible those books are an outright lie, but I don\\u2019t think they are.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think she has a weapon, and I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019d be as confident as she is, because she knows about cockroaches and cats.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo weapon can guarantee a slaughter of every last enemy,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe more varied the opposition, the more survivors you\\u2019ll see.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCats?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have to see the pictures.\\xa0 When they talk about it with the younger children, they use pictures of little cats, some black, some white, some calico\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Point being,</em>\\u201d I interrupted, \\u201cwe\\u2019ve got all sorts of super soldiers and regular soldiers and people in different positions around the city.\\xa0 There\\u2019s no device she can deploy or plague or parasite she could pack it with that is going to wipe us out so thoroughly that she\\u2019ll feel confident just strolling out of Brechwell.\\xa0 A weapon?\\xa0 No.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs there an option after four?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIdeology.\\xa0 Change minds, you change the paradigm.\\xa0 She tried that on me last night.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid it work?\\u201d\\xa0 Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI haven\\u2019t raised the subject, but you seemed to be considering it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was running away, not running <em>to</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNow?\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 Even with the horrors that might be perpetrated, the ones Lillian talked about, I think I might rather live in a world where Fray\\u2019s books got out and the Academy couldn\\u2019t quite stop it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That seemed to startle Lillian, who was walking to my left.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLike I told Fray, I\\u2019m not loyal to the Academy.\\xa0 I\\u2019m loyal to the <em>Lambs.\\xa0 </em>What the Academy is doing with us, it\\u2019s a lazy, unhurried approach.\\xa0 Raise a generation of brains and abilities, put them to use, figure out their limits, discard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a little harsh,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey didn\\u2019t save him,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t need to say who \\u2018him\\u2019 was.</p>\\n<p>As long as I kept my eyes on the ground, my hood blocked off my view of the other Lambs.\\xa0 \\u201cThe key to a good con is to rush the victim.\\xa0 Deny them the ability to think clearly.\\xa0 Apply the right kind of pressure and deny a man a chance to truly think, and you can fleece the Lord King of the Crown Empire of his crown.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHells bells, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said, lowering his voice.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t say something like that in public.\\xa0 We can talk about betraying the Crown all you want, and we can explain our way out of that, but if you talk like <em>that</em>\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cRight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou want to con the Academy?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cApply pressure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not just that.\\xa0 Pressure isn\\u2019t always bad.\\xa0 You know this, Mary, you live by it.\\xa0 In contests and records of strength, speed, in development of new and innovative biological sciences, we see accident, luck, or effort raise the bar.\\xa0 The rest of the world realizes that it\\u2019s possible to go that one step further.\\xa0 They work harder, they hone their ability, they study the particulars\\u2026 and the rest of the world catches up.\\xa0 What was impossible or world news one year becomes the norm a few years later.\\xa0 The world moves, and people push themselves harder to keep up with that new normal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I paused, inviting question, response, commentary.\\xa0 The Lambs were quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy is lazy, lackadaisical.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not really <em>trying</em>, so much as it\\u2019s maintaining a natural, lazy sort of momentum.\\xa0 Now imagine a world where the books are out there.\\xa0 What does the Academy do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWar, hunt for Fray,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, more basic.\\xa0 What behavior does it default to in a pinch?\\xa0 What does it crave?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cControl,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve harped on it enough in the past.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey want control, but they\\u2019re dealing with something subtle.\\xa0 It\\u2019s all in the background, all indirect.\\xa0 The nature of war changes, and the books <em>punctuate</em> that,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I was getting more excited and emphatic as I spoke.\\xa0 \\u201cHow do you fight that threat?\\xa0 How <em>have</em> they been fighting it, with the Ghosts?\\xa0 Same sort of problem.\\xa0 Background, hard to nail down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBadly?\\u201d Helen suggested.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot disagreeing,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut they\\u2019ve been keeping up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy doesn\\u2019t lose,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cRemember?\\xa0 A perpetual stalemate is pretty good for the Academy\\u2019s enemies.\\xa0 You could even make the argument that it\\u2019s hurting the Academy over time, because of how those Ghosts are created.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d reminded <em>myself</em> of the other side of the coin.</p>\\n<p>The mice.\\xa0 Not just the ones of Radham.\\xa0 The little ones who couldn\\u2019t fend for themselves.\\xa0 The survivors.</p>\\n<p>I kept talking anyway, \\u201cThink about it.\\xa0 How have they been fighting the Ghosts?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPetey,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Engineer.\\xa0 The Wry Man.\\xa0 Dog, Catcher.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe talents they\\u2019re using, the tools.\\xa0 Tracking, talent, infiltration, versatility, they\\u2019re <em>brain</em> tools.\\xa0 Problem solving tools.\\xa0 Put the books out there for everyone to have,\\u201d I said, \\u201cand the world is plunged into a situation where wars aren\\u2019t won on battlefields so much as they\\u2019re won in shadows and behind closed doors.\\xa0 The Lambs stop being side projects that are kept on a shelf and brought out for special cases, we stop being <em>secondary</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs it worth the cost?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI really don\\u2019t.\\xa0 Makes me wonder if Fray doesn\\u2019t want to recruit us more than she\\u2019s letting on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething to think about when and if we go to see her,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhich means we\\u2019ve got to decide on a plan of action, and we\\u2019re going to have to make our move, sometime in the next hour, if we\\u2019re going to do it before the rest of the forces approach and collapse on her.\\xa0 Before\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He trailed off.</p>\\n<p><em>Before the new Lamb arrives</em>.</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 That little niggle about the time constraint had been sitting in the back of my mind.\\xa0 An echo of my recent argument about the value of pressure, and it was complicated further by-</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe problem,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cIs we\\u2019ve got to do it while that region of the city is surrounded by \\u2018allied\\u2019 forces.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Yeah.\\xa0 that.</em></p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/11/24/tooth-and-nail-7-14/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>As before, Warren served as the escort.\\xa0 The musclebound man wore a suit that hadn\\u2019t been put together by a true craftsman.\\xa0 I could see, here and there, how the suit jacket pulled and where there was a bit of clumsiness at the seams.\\xa0 It was good work, all the same, but whoever had done it probably wasn\\u2019t a seamstress.</p>\\n<p>Our destination wasn\\u2019t the same room I\\u2019d gone to the previous night.\\xa0 We passed down a hallway, and there were people in the rebellion\\u2019s make-shift uniform, predominantly men, sitting and standing on either side of the long hallway.\\xa0 Groups of humans, groups of stitched, and plague men stood apart, one or two paces separating each from the other.\\xa0 The stitched had a smell when they congregated in numbers or were in bad shape, and both were the case here.</p>\\n<p>They waited at the ready for real conflict to unfold.</p>\\n<p>A hand touched mine, grabbing and nearly taking hold before I slipped mine free.\\xa0 My first instinct was to think it was one of the soldiers we were passing.\\xa0 I looked and saw that it was Lillian\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>I gestured.\\xa0 <em>Question.</em>\\xa0 Why?</p>\\n<p><em>Fear.\\xa0 Me.</em>\\xa0 Scared.</p>\\n<p>I saw a few curious looks from nearby soldiers, and wondered if they might see it as us plotting something.\\xa0 I leaned closer to Lillian, and I murmured in her ear.\\xa0 Ironic that it was very possibly less suspicious than the gestures.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to look strong, stand straight, look confident.\\xa0 We shouldn\\u2019t hold hands.\\xa0 That looks weird, and weird is something they\\u2019ll notice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She gave me the slightest of nods, averting her eyes.</p>\\n<p>I could see her trying to pull herself together, but the tension was etched into her expression.\\xa0 When she saw a movement, her head turned all at once, eyebrows going up and together in concern.\\xa0 She realized it was just a man changing position, and that heightened tension didn\\u2019t fade, it only climbed and built up into something.</p>\\n<p>I suppressed a sigh and reached out for her hand, squeezing it.</p>\\n<p>It was our first serious mission since we\\u2019d lost Jamie.\\xa0 The loss hadn\\u2019t even occurred in the field, but now we were in a dangerous situation, there were other things going on, and Lillian wasn\\u2019t coping.</p>\\n<p>Working to help her was at least helping <em>me</em> feel more centered.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Mary, and I could see how tense she was.\\xa0 I reached out to touch her arm, and she flinched.</p>\\n<p>Then she saw me and relaxed.\\xa0 She managed a smile.\\xa0 I let my hand fall.</p>\\n<p>Warren opened the door, inviting us to step into the back room.</p>\\n<p>The room I had been in before had been for larger gatherings, a space large enough to dance in, or to set up a stage and have room for audience.\\xa0 This room was something closer to a large dining room, and tables had been placed against tall windows with curtains on either side, the table legs making the curtains poke out.</p>\\n<p>The tables weren\\u2019t long enough to cover the entire window, and the top two or three feet of each window was left exposed.\\xa0 The light from outside was meager, the sky already overcast, rain pounding down, and periodically, one of the lights from the towers moved over the building, too diffuse in daylight to be distinct.\\xa0 It still made the room just a little bit brighter, now and again.</p>\\n<p>Fray and Avis were at one end of the room, Fray leaning back against a table, hands gripping the edges, while Cynthia stabbed a finger in her direction, it sounded heated.\\xa0 Fray was dressed similar to how she had been dressed last night, with a knee-length dress, stockings, and a shorter coat.\\xa0 The only changes she\\u2019d made were to tie her hair back and to don a belt that had equipment hanging from it.\\xa0 An octopus was out of water, set on the table just a half-foot from her hand.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia, by contrast, had foregone the dress and stockings for a tight-fitting jacket, sweater, and what might have been riding slacks, tight against the leg.\\xa0 She had a gun at one hip, a short sword at the other, and a long rifle slung over her back.\\xa0 She looked like an entirely different person, even though her face was still that same eerie, ill-fitting mask, her hair covering much of it.</p>\\n<p>Fray looked at the Lambs as we entered, and she seemed almost <em>relieved</em> to see us.</p>\\n<p>She held up a finger.\\xa0 <em>Wait</em>.</p>\\n<p>I realized I was interpreting that as a gesture, when it was a common shorthand.</p>\\n<p>It made sense to take control of the situation by making a visitor wait.\\xa0 Professors and barons of business did it all time.\\xa0 Fray would\\u2019ve been right to do it here, even acknowledging how little time there was.</p>\\n<p>But she wasn\\u2019t doing it for that reason.\\xa0 She really couldn\\u2019t abandon the ongoing discussion with Cynthia.</p>\\n<p>I turned my eyes away from that scene.\\xa0 There were other players who posed more immediate danger, people who might take advantage of Fray\\u2019s distraction.</p>\\n<p>As was the case with Cynthia, many had changed clothes with a purpose.\\xa0 The gigantic fellow with the birthing saw, I was having trouble placing his name, he was wearing a military outfit now, and he\\u2019d gathered with others of his ilk.\\xa0 There was a man with short hair and very thick glasses who stood by his cat-like warbeast.\\xa0 The warbeast\\u2019s head was at just the right height for his hand to settle on while it sat beside him.\\xa0 He\\u2019d traded out his coat for one of the rebellion\\u2019s black jackets, not quite long enough to be a lab coat.\\xa0 I saw a man covered in scars, in a very different way from the plague men, and a burly woman with things crawling just beneath her skin, glowering at anyone nearby, wearing men\\u2019s clothing.</p>\\n<p>Those unique cases out of the way, there were another half-dozen people who passed for human.\\xa0 Men, all of them, they had to be generals or squad leaders.</p>\\n<p>Among the ordinary men were Mauer and Percy.\\xa0 The pair were the same as they had been last night, in the most general sense, a worn down old academic in nicer looking clothes, and a soldier with a deceptively fresh face and military clothes that had seen some use.</p>\\n<p>That said, both had dressed as if they expected to see conflict.\\xa0 Mauer wore his jacket, having had pulled it over the one arm, with a chain across the lapels keeping it in place, where it simply hung over the mutated arm.\\xa0 He had an exorcist rifle, and unless I was missing something, he hadn\\u2019t burdened himself with vials and medical tools like some had.</p>\\n<p>Percy wore his long coat, and he did have a gun at his hip, a long-barreled pistol, the holster attached to the two belts he wore to hold all of the myriad pouches and tools.</p>\\n<p>Mary stepped forward, coming to stand beside me, and I could see the movement of her throat as she swallowed.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s hand went out, resting on Mary\\u2019s shoulder.</p>\\n<p>As a group, we approached the pair.</p>\\n<p>The me of a year ago might have tried to talk to Mauer, regardless of the circumstance.\\xa0 I recognized how important this was, however, and held my tongue.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMr. Percy,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy girl,\\u201d the long-haired academic responded.</p>\\n<p>I shivered a little at the choice of words.\\xa0 From the look of it, the effect was far more profound for Mary.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d known Mary for long enough to know all of the tells, and even I couldn\\u2019t get a good read on her, seeing her now.\\xa0 It worried me that I wasn\\u2019t exactly sure what she would say or do.</p>\\n<p>The conversation had already aborted, in the messiest use of the word.\\xa0 Neither seemed able or willing to speak, and none of the bystanders, Lamb or Shepherd, were interjecting.\\xa0 I was glad.\\xa0 If Mauer jumped in, the conversation would likely be his, with the pair on the periphery.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re well, Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m\\u2026 overall, I\\u2019m well.\\xa0 Right now?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She seemed to flounder for words.</p>\\n<p>The tells were for anger, excitement, impatience, insecurity.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what to feel right now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpeaking for myself, I\\u2019m glad to see you.\\xa0 When I first joined Cynthia\\u2019s group, they told me the Academy\\u2019s group had eliminated all of my, ah, children.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMisinformation or lies?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know, Sylvester,\\u201d Percy said.\\xa0 He looked at Cynthia.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve wondered which it was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou worked for her before, but now you\\u2019re on opposing sides?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>She sounded younger than she was, as she asked the question.</p>\\n<p><em>Mental note, Sylvester: her mental and emotional guards are down.\\xa0 Mary is vulnerable.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s not go that far,\\u201d Percy said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe were on opposing sides, but a big part of the meetings over the past half-week have been about mending the fences.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe hope,\\u201d Mauer commented.\\xa0 His attention had passed to Cynthia as well, and I was guessing he was viewing the situation with forward-looking eyes, where Percy had been looking to past events.</p>\\n<p><em>My</em> eyes were on the present.</p>\\n<p>If I had to guess, Fray seemed anxious.\\xa0 That crimson-painted smile of hers seemed a little too relentless in the face of Cynthia\\u2019s fury to be anything but fake, and her lower eyelids were raised, her focus fully on the discussion as she picked her words, speaking to Cynthia with purpose.</p>\\n<p>That anxiety was very interesting and it was very worrisome for the Lambs as well.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lambs did a very good job of executing some of the more educated members of Cynthia\\u2019s contingent,\\u201d Percy observed.\\xa0 \\u201cThat night in Whitney?\\xa0 Or is that so commonplace you don\\u2019t remember?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI remember,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe remember.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a comment to be made about Mary possibly forgetting that she was part of a <em>we</em>, even for a moment.\\xa0 That comment was not to be spoken out loud.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMilitary leaders took over, resources were shuffled around, projects were canceled, until more academic minds gathered to share resources and ensure the work on projects could continue.\\xa0 Cynthia returned, saw the way things had changed, and adapted, as she does so marvelously,\\u201d Percy said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe took control over the military group, hand picked a few key minds and personalities to bring to her side, and left the rest of us to continue to fend for ourselves.\\xa0 When we created something worth using, we sold it to her side.\\xa0 Those of us who were still willing to deal with her after the insults and dismissiveness her people had directed our way, that is\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI expected more hard feelings,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cLike I said, we\\u2019re mending fences.\\xa0 For the sake of bigger things, I\\u2019m willing to leave the past in the past.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Which isn\\u2019t to say there aren\\u2019t or weren\\u2019t hard feelings</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe schism over our ultimate goals and a competition for resources broke us.\\xa0 Fray intends to mend us,\\u201d Percy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd Cynthia doesn\\u2019t agree?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>Mauer smiled.\\xa0 The thumb of his good hand was tapping arrhythmically against his leg, something I might have taken for a signal or code if I didn\\u2019t know better.\\xa0 His face didn\\u2019t betray the anxiety.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll say this: for someone so adaptable and clever, she\\u2019s proving remarkably stubborn in the here and now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He turned to look at us, then gave Helen a double take.\\xa0 \\u201cThe little girl I nearly shot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not sure where we stand, me and the Lambs.\\xa0 You\\u2019re enemies in our midst, but we\\u2019re being civil.\\xa0 In my case, because Fray and Percy have demanded it of me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m always civil,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cMostly always.\\xa0 Sometimes I get excited, but even when I\\u2019m twisting people apart or stalking or killing them, I try to be polite.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s important,\\u201d Mauer responded.\\xa0 \\u201cSelf control.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>Percy tilted his head.\\xa0 \\u201cHave you decided how you\\u2019re feeling, Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She put her tongue between her lips to wet them where they had dried.\\xa0 Cleaned of the smoke and the touch of dust from when we\\u2019d sprinted through the dust cloud, the lips had more color.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve always been good at doing the job.\\xa0 Focusing on a task.\\xa0 Do that.\\xa0 Have certain enemies, have certain allies.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve never-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She stopped.</p>\\n<p>Percy didn\\u2019t interject.\\xa0 I realized I was holding my breath, and let it out.</p>\\n<p>She abandoned the sentence she\\u2019d cut short, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what to feel.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know that I trained you to be as focused and goal-oriented as you are, yes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAfter making the initial headway, training each of you, I started to think about the next part of the plan, and I wondered if I had overdone it.\\xa0 If I\\u2019d made you too narrow, incapable of operating outside of the bounds I\\u2019d defined.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think I am,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think you are either,\\u201d Percy said, glancing at each of the Lambs before looking back at her.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I did have a time where I worried if you\\u2019d be well-rounded enough for the leadership of my next generation of children.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>The first of the lies I told her.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd I failed?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 I caught the hint of hurt in her voice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 No, not at all.\\xa0 I was a novice then, you were still learning, still innovating and developing your own techniques with the tools I had given you.\\xa0 I put that worry behind me very quickly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you decided, in the end, that I was nothing more than a tool?\\xa0 To discard me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Again, the hurt.</p>\\n<p>I could see the realization hit him.\\xa0 His eyes met mine for the duration of a lightning\\u2019s strike.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI regret leaving you behind,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI very nearly got captured before Cynthia stepped in, and then I was told you were gone.\\xa0 I did mourn.\\xa0 You were a major part of a pivotal and lengthy chapter in my life.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t a lie, but it wasn\\u2019t the truth.\\xa0 He could see and I could see that Mary wanted more.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou made promises to me,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>My heart pounded.\\xa0 I was the rabbit in the snow with a predator looking on.\\xa0 Calling any attention to myself at all with movement or sound could see that predator lashing out.</p>\\n<p>Would he disrupt the uneasy truce in this room and simply tell her the truth?\\xa0 That he had intended to keep his promises?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnce, I meant to keep them,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou were too clever, I was too arrogant.\\xa0 I remembered stories about mistakes made fifty and a hundred years ago, when the Academies were newer and more callow, and I let those stories influence my judgment.\\xa0 What use did my work have for me, once you had blossomed into your true self?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart was beating <em>faster</em>, hearing his explanation.\\xa0 He was helping me.\\xa0 Supporting my lies.</p>\\n<p>To have an answer that sounded that good, was it truth?</p>\\n<p>No.\\xa0 Not the truth.</p>\\n<p>But a fear that he had harbored, made out to be fact, maybe.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo you would have had me kill my parents and kill myself, lost like all of the others?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Yes,</em>\\u201d he said, and the emotion he injected into that one word was real, but likely to be something else entirely.\\xa0 Pain, perhaps.\\xa0 His words were insistent, driven, as if he was hammering in each point as he might a physical nail, \\u201cWhen I made you, when I gave you that drive and that focus you just described to me, I made you in <em>my</em> image.\\xa0 To be too focused, to feel as though there is <em>one thing</em> to do, <em>one thing</em> to focus on, <em>one thing</em> that answers the question?\\xa0 That is my struggle as much as it is yours.\\xa0 The clones were designed with a purpose in mind, and I thought that if I only stuck to that plan and that purpose, I could see my way forward.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s expression had changed.\\xa0 The tells of anger and anxiety had faded.\\xa0 Her hawk-like eyes were focused on him and his every word.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven,\\u201d he said, \\u201cTo the point of sacrificing you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you for saying so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it means anything, I\\u2019ve come to regret the decision.\\xa0 Working for Cynthia, staying out of sight and out of the way of Dog or Catcher\\u2019s noses, cooped up in my lab, I had time to think.\\xa0 To see how short-sighted I was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI appreciate that,\\u201d Mary said, with very little emotion.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me, please,\\u201d he said, \\u201cHave they treated you well?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He looked at me as he said it.</p>\\n<p>I could imagine him communicating with me through that glance.\\xa0 The short exchange we\\u2019d had about Mary, about the lies we\\u2019d both told, with no specifics given.</p>\\n<p>He might as well have said it to my face:<em> I\\u2019ve lied for your sake, if you haven\\u2019t looked after her\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey have,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She looked at Gordon and then raised a hand, overlaying his where he\\u2019d left it on her arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m glad.\\xa0 When I worried about your aptitude as a leader, I remember thinking about how you hadn\\u2019t bonded with your brothers.\\xa0 You always seemed very lonely, dear Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t while I had you,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>There was no affection in the words.\\xa0 A simple stated fact.</p>\\n<p>The lingering threads of the puppeteer had been cut.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhile you grow, you\\u2019ll need to change your diet,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have a team working with me,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSupplements?\\xa0 The builder\\u2019s acids, the concentration-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwenty percent.\\xa0 Type F.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cC,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cC.\\xa0 Tell them.\\xa0 Twenty-five percent should do it.\\xa0 You grew quickly in the early stages, you\\u2019re growing a little bit faster even now.\\xa0 The Type C should include a good calcium mix, and it will keep byproducts from accumulating in your joints.\\xa0 Without it, you\\u2019ll find yourself with arthritic symptoms.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll remember,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll hit a wall before too long.\\xa0 Rapid growth, tissue regeneration, byproducts from the non-human cells, organ failure, cancers-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know I have an expiration date,\\u201d Mary said, her voice quiet.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s fingers tightened on Mary\\u2019s arm.\\xa0 I found I couldn\\u2019t look at anyone in particular, my focus destroyed by recurrent visions of Jamie, the reality of expiration dates.</p>\\n<p>His face was taut with concern and repressed emotion as he spoke, sounding as if he were twenty feet away rather than five.\\xa0 \\u201cI was callow and stupid, starting out.\\xa0 Arrogant and narrow-minded.\\xa0 I thought a few years less of having to care for infants was worth a vastly shortened lifespan in my creations, that there was no point, because you weren\\u2019t to serve any use after a certain point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I had grown slower, I might not have met the Lambs,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr found where I belonged.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy didn\\u2019t respond to that.\\xa0 He moved his hands, as if he were going to put them into pockets, realized he was wearing a different coat, and folded his arms instead.\\xa0 He swallowed, cleared his throat, and nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy friend seems to be speechless, as that might be the next best thing to forgiveness he will ever get,\\u201d Mauer said, smiling, \\u201cI\\u2019ll ask the question he would ask: are the Lambs going to join Fray?\\xa0 I imagine he might like to have you over for tea, if nothing else.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI-\\u201d Mary started.\\xa0 She glanced at me.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 My feelings are\\u2026 mixed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI abandoned you,\\u201d Percy said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s understandable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 Then she shook her head, \\u201cNot that, not only that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat, then?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe children,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Percy\\u2019s eyebrows came together.\\xa0 \\u201cWhich?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s just it,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s so many.\\xa0 The ones you kidnapped and cloned, the ones you raised and used as weapons, myself included, now the Ghosts?\\xa0 Always children.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes that bother you?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 \\u201cOr does it bother you because it bothers <em>them?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The statement \\u2018I didn\\u2019t design you with a conscience\\u2019 was so implicit in the question that he might as well have said it out loud.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut it\\u2019s not about me.\\xa0 I\\u2019m trying to understand you, Mr. Percy, and I don\\u2019t know if I understand <em>this</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cI won\\u2019t sway you from this topic any more than you could be distracted from your duties, I don\\u2019t think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnswer the question, please,\\u201d Mary said, that last word applying only a veneer of civility to the demand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t a question, it was a statement, with-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy children, Mr. Percy?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause they\\u2019re the easiest to <em>use</em>, Mary.\\xa0 They\\u2019re the most malleable, the easiest to shape.\\xa0 That\\u2019s the pat answer, isn\\u2019t it?\\xa0 You have only to look at the Lambs to know this is a maxim the <em>Academy</em> believes in, too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the not-pat answer?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 Her voice was firm.\\xa0 She still wasn\\u2019t relenting.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I\\u2019m a little bit poetic in how I phrase this, you\\u2019ll have to blame the Reverend,\\u201d Percy said.\\xa0 He looked <em>sad</em>, even as he joked, \\u201cIn wartime, children suffer the most.\\xa0 I think a part of me knew that, that it was most efficient to get that out of the way, perhaps?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s right at all,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s demented.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Percy smiled a sad smile.\\xa0 \\u201cThen we\\u2019ll go back to the first answer, as pat as it might be.\\xa0 I took very few Academy classes, and the ratios and numbers involving children and childhood were fresh in my mind when I started work.\\xa0 Narrow minded as I am, I didn\\u2019t think to change course.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYet you said you spent time in Cynthia\\u2019s service, regretting past choices.\\xa0 Now, with the Ghosts, you\\u2019re making the same choices again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, dear Mary,\\u201d the puppeteer said.\\xa0 He reached out, to put a hand on her face, and she stepped back out of the way.\\xa0 He recovered, and he said, \\u201cFor what it\\u2019s worth, I made the new ones dumb.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t want to become attached to them, only to lose them.\\xa0 I learned that much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 As she was wont to do, she\\u2019d shifted to a more imperious stance and tone, the <em>young lady, </em>the Mothmont girl.\\xa0 \\u201cWith all due respect, Mr. Percy, I don\\u2019t believe we\\u2019ll be joining you for tea, whatever happens.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could see the hurt on his face.\\xa0 Even with that hurt, he managed to respond with decorum, \\u201cThen I wish you the best.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary turned to Gordon, and the two of them turned away, with Lillian and Helen following.</p>\\n<p>I was the last to step away.\\xa0 Percy\\u2019s eyes bored into mine.</p>\\n<p>I might never know all of his reasons for why he\\u2019d done what he had, but I could guess as to some.</p>\\n<p>I gave him a nod.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t move.</p>\\n<p>I hurried to join the others.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia and Fray were still embroiled in their private discussion, the rest of the room standing well clear, but for the men I took to be Cynthia\\u2019s lieutenants.\\xa0 This had gone well beyond the point where a delay was comfortable.\\xa0 The attack was imminent, and we hadn\\u2019t had a chance to talk yet.</p>\\n<p>We were counting on Fray for an escape route and options, and when she looked as troubled as she did, it left me feeling anxious too.</p>\\n<p><em>Trouble</em>, I signaled Gordon, as he looked back to see where I\\u2019d gone to.\\xa0 I caught up with the others.</p>\\n<p><em>We-go away-talk-question.</em>\\xa0 Should we break away, plan?</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.\\xa0 We wouldn\\u2019t get a chance, anyway.</p>\\n<p>Helen stood in front of the man with the birthing saw.\\xa0 She seemed to bounce on the spot as she said, \\u201cHi!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He glowered down at her.</p>\\n<p>A chair clattered to the ground.\\xa0 The room was tense enough that more than a few hands went to guns, though only one or two were drawn from holsters.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia had pushed it over.</p>\\n<p>She pulled herself together, standing straighter.\\xa0 One hand went to the front of her jacket, fixing it at the collar.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, everyone else, for your time.\\xa0 I appreciate your efforts and the sentiment.\\xa0 I would wish you luck as well, but it wouldn\\u2019t be sincere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked from her to Fray.\\xa0 Fray\\u2019s eyes were on the ground.\\xa0 I knew that look, though I\\u2019d never seen it.\\xa0 I\\u2019d worn it on my own face when I\\u2019d been up to my neck in trains of thought and permutations and complications.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re leaving,\\u201d Cynthia said.</p>\\n<p>Mauer chuckled.\\xa0 Every set of eyes in the room went to him.\\xa0 \\u201cRetreating to your room like a child?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Cynthia said, her voice low and dangerous.\\xa0 \\u201cNot to my room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re surrounded,\\u201d Percy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been fighting through warzones since I was old enough to walk.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve fought my share of monsters, experiment and human alike,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t plan to die.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She gestured a wave of one hand, and her people joined her.\\xa0 A little under half of the people in the room migrated in her direction, following in her wake as she made her way through the door.\\xa0 The man with the birthing saw walked past the Lambs, followed by his \\u2018brothers\\u2019, putting a hand on Helen\\u2019s head as he passed her.\\xa0 He had to duck low as he reached the door, lest he smash his collarbone on the frame.</p>\\n<p>The room was nearly silent, though we could hear Cynthia barking orders to her people in the hallway.\\xa0 A significant share would be hers.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Fray, and she hadn\\u2019t come out of that state of focus, her mind going a mile a minute, yet to find a way out.</p>\\n<p><em>Not part of the plan, huh</em>?\\xa0 I wondered.</p>\\n<p><a

massacre,\\u201d Mary said, counting on her fingers, \\u201cShe wants a victory, to get out alive and do that thing with the books, she expects us to make an approach and discuss, and maybe to convince us?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot victory,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe wants to prove she\\u2019s the person with the answers, ideally by swaying people to her side with her rhetoric.\\xa0 But yes.\\xa0 That\\u2019s where she is, her attention is split, even if she had it mostly in hand, she\\u2019s going to be stressed and distracted, trying to coordinate.\\xa0 Now she got a short phrase or a note from Catcher, she\\u2019s expecting us to be there, and we\\u2019re not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019ll adapt,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich requires time, attention, focus!\\u201d I said, poking my finger against the glass-littered windowsill to punctuate the three words.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere are the Lambs right now?\\xa0 Are they elsewhere in the building?\\xa0 Is security good enough?\\xa0 What does she need to do to ensure we don\\u2019t derail everything?\\xa0 From now until we show up, <em>if</em> we show up, she\\u2019s going to have to second guess everything against <em>us</em> interfering.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEverything you said was just to throw Dog and Catcher off?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr whoever the mole was.\\xa0 Half truths,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cCatcher might have noted something about the Lambs using labs and facilities in the building to start a fire and disrupt her group.\\xa0 Is it another ruse, is it possible I got enough info in my visit?\\xa0 Right now, I imagine he\\u2019s signaling to Fray.\\xa0 Either a light or gestures that can be seen with binoculars.\\xa0 A simple, crude system, or he wouldn\\u2019t have to go down to deliver a note in person.\\xa0 He\\u2019d let the people on the wall fill those stitched with bullets.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s assume you\\u2019re right-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re running out of time.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve been arguing, we aren\\u2019t any closer-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet me stop you there,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFirst off, Lillian, sorry.\\xa0 I had to take a hard stance, or your stubbornness would have derailed our shot at ferreting out the mole.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She was frowning at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon.\\xa0 We have two options.\\xa0 Option one, we use the next hour to figure out the key figures in this and we remove them.\\xa0 Shake the box of bugs here, on the perimeter, see what stands out.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think Fray has been talking to each and every person here at this Academy.\\xa0 She would have had to have targeted a few key people, teachers or commanding officers, people who resent the man at the top or who are jaded from the war, much like Mauer, and she turned them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s predicated on a lot of assumptions, Sy,\\u201d Mary told me.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing guaranteeing you\\u2019re even right about the mutiny.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrue,\\u201d I said, \\u201cAnd we\\u2019d be working against the other experiments.\\xa0 Assuming they can hear us, they\\u2019d be trying to stop us.\\xa0 If things come down to a he-said, he-said with us and Catcher, I don\\u2019t think people are going to listen to the kids.\\xa0 It\\u2019s how things work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s option two?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe signal another drop, we cross over, and we confront Fray,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIdeally, we do it as close to the deadline as possible.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cClose to the deadline?\\xa0 When the signal is given?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe just talked about it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat did you call me out on?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTime constraints,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFray created her own time constraint.\\xa0 She wants us to come in.\\xa0 She knows reinforcements are coming in by train.\\xa0 Maybe they\\u2019re hers, maybe not, but the time window is small.\\xa0 Now, assuming I\\u2019m right, I\\u2019ve got her number, my estimation of the situation is on target, soldier turning against soldier, traps going off, whatever else, the safest place for us to be isn\\u2019t <em>here</em>.\\xa0 The safest place is <em>there</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I pointed at Fray\\u2019s building.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf your estimation is <em>wrong</em>, that\\u2019s the most dangerous place to be.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf she has absolutely no plan, no escape route, no options?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah, worst place to be.\\xa0 But a war is about to erupt here, it\\u2019s tense enough that Helen\\u2019s hair is standing on end-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-and honestly, the best options available to us are to either be as far away from this as possible, or turn to the smartest person in the area and do what they\\u2019re doing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s predicated on us joining them,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not joining them,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot while you\\u2019re against it.\\xa0 But I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019re capable of stopping them, either.\\xa0 We might need to play along just a bit-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d she said, in a way that sounded very far from agreement.\\xa0 \\u201cI see your angle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo angle,\\u201d I said, looking at the building again.\\xa0 \\u201cI swear.\\xa0 But we need to get close.\\xa0 For a lot of reasons.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>Mary spoke up, \\u201cIf what Sy said about me getting to make the final decision on Percy is right, then I want to go.\\xa0 It makes sense, and I think we can do more there than here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, smiling a bit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t feel confident making a decision,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI believe you, I trust you, but we\\u2019re just charging in?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou love charging in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith no plan in mind?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen I\\u2019ll break the tie,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>A few of us turned to her in surprise.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re usually content to go with the flow,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUsually,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I couldn\\u2019t sleep normally last night.\\xa0 I felt funny.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh no,\\u201d Gordon said, hand going to his face.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen <em>Helen</em> says that\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was a squirmy, warm feeling, all nestled in my belly, and I kept drifting in and out, thinking about the people we saw.\\xa0 The man with the birthing saw.\\xa0 I want to hold him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHold him?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 She\\u2019d gone a little pale.</p>\\n<p>Helen had a smile on her face, warm, like a little girl looking at her new sibling.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd Genevieve Fray, and the others.\\xa0 I wanted to hug them and break them, open them and wrap them around me and me around them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I murmured, \\u201cThis is the point where I\\u2019d normally tell you to stop.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh?\\u201d Helen asked.\\xa0 \\u201cNormally?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut I think it\\u2019s dangerous to cut you short and move forward blind.\\xa0 Finish talking,\\u201d I said, knowing I was going to regret it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wanted to know what the inside of their skin feels like, kind of?\\xa0 If I could make a cut and slide my hands between the skin and the meat, and feel all of them with all of me, while they writhed?\\xa0 I suppose I\\u2019d have to break them first, like I said, and it would have to be multiple cuts, if-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGetting off track.\\xa0 Try again.\\xa0 Focus.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI had <em>really</em> interesting dreams,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s steer things back to what you were <em>feeling.\\xa0 </em>You want to go inside?\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Early, in my first interactions with Helen, I\\u2019d made the mistake of assuming that she didn\\u2019t <em>feel</em>.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t the case.\\xa0 Helen had an emotional spectrum, but it didn\\u2019t translate to what we felt.\\xa0 Priorities were different, the goals and construction of it were different, and it was only with practice and training that she and Ibott had crafted an end result that could be seen as analogous to a human\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>In this case, she was describing a more engineered end result, one where her killer instinct and her first flickerings of feeling for others had mingled into another sort of emotion or drive.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, hum.\\xa0 I want to feel that <em>want</em> again.\\xa0 Even if we don\\u2019t hurt them, it felt more <em>more</em> than most things I feel, I want to try it, so I can understand it better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m already dreading having to write this down for the paperwork for Ibott,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m going to have to ask follow-up questions and I really don\\u2019t want to ask follow-up questions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was sad, sleeping in a bed all alone,\\u201d Helen mused, talking more to herself than to us.\\xa0 She turned to Mary so suddenly that Mary startled a little.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought about going to your room and crawling under the covers with you, Mary, since Lillian was with Sy.\\xa0 To hold you, and not feel like there was so much dead, empty darkness around me.\\xa0 But I didn\\u2019t want to disturb your sleep, so I decided not to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI appreciate that,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t, uh, feel that way about me?\\xa0 Wanting to feel the inside of my skin?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen shook her head.\\xa0 \\u201cSilly Mary.\\xa0 Doing that would probably <em>kill you</em>.\\xa0 I like you, I don\\u2019t want you to die.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSilly Mary,\\u201d I echoed Helen.\\xa0 Mary shot me an offended look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re warmer and less empty feeling than a bed and covers are.\\xa0 That\\u2019s why I wanted to go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cCan someone change the topic?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think that empty what you\\u2019re describing is loneliness, Helen,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas it?\\xa0 Is it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe mission is important,\\u201d Helen said, eyes wide, very serious, sounding like a small child espousing what they saw as an absolute truth.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to get in the way of that, no matter how big and, um, swirly my feelings feel.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood Helen,\\u201d I said, reaching out to give her a pat on the head.</p>\\n<p>She beamed at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s one more person wanting to go in,\\u201d Gordon said, as if the prior conversation hadn\\u2019t happened.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you three are that certain, then I\\u2019m willing to go along with this.\\xa0 Delaying and arguing is going to put us in as much risk as anything else, at this point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt feels like whatever we do is the wrong choice,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrust me,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t ask that lightly.\\xa0 I remember losing Jamie.\\xa0 I know what we\\u2019re doing is dangerous, and I wouldn\\u2019t ask if I didn\\u2019t think it was worth it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian pursed her lips.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we can stop whatever she\\u2019s engineered from happening, but if we\\u2019re going to, it\\u2019s going to be with <em>us</em> there,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe more likely result is that we go there, we talk with her, we borrow her plans and safeguards to survive whatever happens next, and we go our separate ways, with us having convinced her that the Lambs <em>might</em> change sides.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t answer for a long minute.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomeone needs to go ask for them to drop more artillery shells,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d agreed.\\xa0 We were on track.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHubris can go,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019ll deliver a note.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon had paper, I had a pen.\\xa0 He scribbled down instructions, consulting Lillian\\u2019s pocket watch.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTake this to the officer we talked to earlier,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThen come find us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hubris made a sound low in his throat, a huff of response, then ran off, twice as fast as any of us could travel.</p>\\n<p>We were left in silence.</p>\\n<p>Bells started to sound, one or two distant knells, before stopping.</p>\\n<p>Not a signal.\\xa0 There was no gunfire, no sound of any device going off, no chaos.\\xa0 Even the Brechwell Beast was quiet for the moment.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably the Beast entering a new area,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI wonder if she coordinated that.\\xa0 If the people in the tower are helping to steer and bait it, then she might want the Beast further away if reinforcements come.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Another awkward silence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat you said before, about me acting like an abusive husband,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy, no, I was angry, I was-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight.\\xa0 You were right.\\xa0 Partially,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, I don\\u2019t want you to think like that.\\xa0 That\\u2019s not right, it\\u2019s not what I meant.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope you know I\\u2019d die for you,\\u201d I said, meeting her eyes.</p>\\n<p>Her mouth opened, but she didn\\u2019t manage words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny of you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not saying that in order to manipulate or serve some complicated goal, I\\u2019m saying it because it\\u2019s true.\\xa0 You\\u2019re important to me.\\xa0 If I hurt you, genuinely hurt you, I want to know.\\xa0 I might poke fun or tease and mislead or lie or be an utter bastard, but I do it for you, for all of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou are what you are, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe never had any illusions.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve never harbored any hard feelings.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I chanced a glance at Mary.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t speak, but she offered me a small smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t want this,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou acting different, feeling guilty.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou wanted it, you pushed me to face it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to hear you say you\\u2019re going to die for me,\\u201d she said, insistent.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s messed up!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou became a Lamb,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou earned your place with us.\\xa0 I know you have a family, and that\\u2019s something the rest of us don\\u2019t have, but you\\u2019re one of us.\\xa0 If it comes down to it, I\\u2019d lay my life on the line.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\xa0 You\\u2019re saying I\\u2019m lying?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m saying I hear you,\\u201d he said, eyes on the road.\\xa0 He reached for Lillian\\u2019s pocket watch and checked the time.\\xa0 \\u201cBut that\\u2019s not allowed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI get to decide, Gordon, not you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow do you think we\\u2019d feel, if you traded your life for ours?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re going to trade yourself for us, then it\\u2019s only allowed if you get a two for one deal.\\xa0 Same goes for you, Mary.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll do it too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe too,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cThough Ibott would probably kill you, so maybe it should be three to one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave her another pat on the head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr if the mission is on the line?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t overcomplicate it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought you were okay with the teasing,\\u201d I told Lillian.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI am, mostly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was told you liked the teasing, even, by two different sources.\\xa0 That you acted different when there wasn\\u2019t any.\\xa0 I paid attention, tested the hypothesis, and it seemed right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, Lillian?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you <em>have</em> to talk about this, let\\u2019s do it when the others aren\\u2019t around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey know, you know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Of course.\\xa0 So long as we\\u2019re okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re okay,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Her head turned as Gordon reached for her pocket watch again.\\xa0 I reached out and took hold of her hair and gave it a light tug.</p>\\n<p>She hit me.\\xa0 But when I saw her face in profile, she was smiling.</p>\\n<p>Looking at her, Helen, and Mary, all I could think was, <em>girls are so weird.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cBe ready,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>My hands went over my ears.\\xa0 I crouched, using the wall for cover.</p>\\n<p>I felt a touch at my rear end, and wondered for a moment if Helen was in a dangerous mood, or if it was Lillian feeling me up for some perplexing reason, or-</p>\\n<p>Hubris, nosing around.\\xa0 He licked me as I turned around.\\xa0 Why did I keep getting licked?</p>\\n<p>Gordon got Hubris\\u2019 attention, and covered the dog\\u2019s ears.</p>\\n<p>Any moment now.</p>\\n<p>Any moment, then there was no going back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow long do we have, once we\\u2019re there?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 Gordon wasn\\u2019t covering his own ears.\\xa0 I supposed he figured he was resilient enough to deal with the noise of the blast.\\xa0 I pulled a hand away to listen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBefore the final scheduled blasts?\\xa0 Thirty minutes, if we decide we need to leave.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Eyes closed, ears covered once more, I waited.</p>\\n<p>I felt a hand on my shoulder.</p>\\n<p>Movement from Hubris brushing against my backside was the second indication something was wrong.</p>\\n<p>I twisted around, and I came face to face with Catcher, or as close to face to face as was possible, when he was twice as tall as I was, the two of us crouching.</p>\\n<p>His rag-wrapped hand was pressing Hubris down, pinning the struggling dog against the ground.\\xa0 His polearm was extended toward Gordon.</p>\\n<p>It made sense he\\u2019d find us.\\xa0 Even ignoring his exemplary tracking abilities and enhanced senses, he would have been able to follow Hubris.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat gave us away?\\u201d he asked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou specifically?\\xa0 Fray did.\\xa0 Once I start assuming the most inconvenient result, my guesses get a lot more acccurate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Catcher nodded, taking that in stride.\\xa0 Mary had her weapons drawn, but wasn\\u2019t using them.\\xa0 The scene was a still tableau, about to be broken by an artillery shell.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet us go,\\u201d I said, calm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWithout knowing what you\\u2019re planning?\\xa0 I heard some of what you said.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know if I like any of it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wondered momentarily if he\\u2019d heard what Helen had said.\\xa0 The half-second I spent briefly entertaining that thought was a window of opportunity for Gordon to speak.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCatcher,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cNothing good comes from this.\\xa0 If you attack the Lambs here, you get hurt, we get hurt, maybe we die now, at your hands, maybe one side or the other wins, and we get assumed to be on the wrong end of things, and we get executed.\\xa0 But that\\u2019s bullshit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Not quite the argument I would\\u2019ve made in Gordon\\u2019s shoes.\\xa0 Still, I let him continue without me chipping in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re friends, Catcher.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI always liked you, Gordon,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cDog too.\\xa0 I heard what Sylvester said earlier, about how we\\u2019re all trying to survive.\\xa0 I wondered if it was a trick of his, but it sounded genuine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re closer to being one of us than the common-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The artillery shell came down, close.\\xa0 I fell over, senses momentarily obliterated.</p>\\n<p><em>Don\\u2019t attack, don\\u2019t fight</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>I managed to start seeing straight again, and focused on the scene.\\xa0 Catcher hadn\\u2019t flinched, he still had Hubris, and Gordon was still crouched a few feet away, the length of the pole between him and our old friend.</p>\\n<p>Mary hadn\\u2019t attacked either.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet us go,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you believe in what she\\u2019s doing, then trust her to convince <em>us.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t believe in what she\\u2019s doing,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve only done this because I\\u2019m so very tired.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>In the words, the way he spoke, if I listened beyond the shrill noise in my ears, I could hear that fatigue.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t have the stalk and the manhunt be the beginning, middle, and end of my existence,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhatever I\\u2019ll do, it won\\u2019t live up to what I was created to do, but I won\\u2019t be able to go peacefully if I don\\u2019t at least try and fail at another course.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd Dog?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 I could barely hear him with my ears suffering as they were.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe same.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s your course.\\xa0 Let us choose ours,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet us go, before the dust settles.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The second shell came down.\\xa0 Not as violent as the first, being further away, but it rattled the senses once again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-lost Jamie, I thought you would break,\\u201d Catcher was saying, as I started being able to piece together words once again.</p>\\n<p>The mention of the name made me cringe as much as the last shell had.\\xa0 He understood that it was a true <em>loss</em>.\\xa0 That our Jamie was gone.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t have to ask, or evade, or insinuate.\\xa0 He understood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought you might be on the same course as I was.\\xa0 Exhausted.\\xa0 That you\\u2019d end up reaching your limit.\\xa0 Maybe you would have, if they hadn\\u2019t given you the time to grieve and find yourselves.\\xa0 But I reached my limit first, in the end.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d Gordon replied.</p>\\n<p>I was itching to just turn and go, but that wasn\\u2019t a reality.\\xa0 If the dust cleared, we wouldn\\u2019t get a third shot, I was pretty sure.\\xa0 The pattern would be too obvious.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was the futility of the Ghost hunts,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cA chore, find one group, another would spring up.\\xa0 One time I went, and she was waiting.\\xa0 The leash had already loosened, because she\\u2019d leashed everyone else with the same chemical.\\xa0 She offered to free me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCatcher,\\u201d I said, not sure if I was speaking at the right volume.\\xa0 My mind was racing, trying to piece together his psychology, his motivations, and figure out the best possible argument.</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t trying to deter us or hurt us.\\xa0 He was justifying himself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCatcher,\\u201d I said, again, more firmly.\\xa0 \\u201cWe understand.\\xa0 I understood without you needing to explain.\\xa0 When all of this has settled down, we\\u2019ll find you, and we\\u2019ll play cards and share a meal, maybe a drink.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He met my eyes with his own rheumy cataract-white ones.\\xa0 Old scars, but the eyes were sharper than they looked to the untrained eye.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHolding us here is going to push us away, maybe get us killed,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet us go, so we can find you later.\\xa0 So it can be like old times.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019ll never be like old times, Sy,\\u201d Catcher said, voice soft.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s the problem.\\xa0 Time runs out.\\xa0 It\\u2019s gone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He let go of Hubris.\\xa0 The dog snarled, tensing, and Gordon made a small sound.\\xa0 Hubris relaxed in an instant.</p>\\n<p>The polearm moved away from Gordon.</p>\\n<p>Without wasting an instant, we turned.\\xa0 Gordon went from a crouch to hurdling the window, Hubris under one arm, into the dwindling smoke, rain and dust without even checking if the coast was clear.\\xa0 Mary was right after him, then Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were right,\\u201d Catcher said, behind me.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout what comes next.\\xa0 That it\\u2019s a massacre.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLive,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s what I\\u2019m trying to do, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could see, looking at it, that the smoke was too thin.\\xa0 If anyone was looking, and there were an awful lot of eyes to be looking, the shadows of our movement would be visible.</p>\\n<p>I reached for Lillian\\u2019s hand and pulled her after me.\\xa0 If she hesitated, it might be too late.</p>\\n<p>Into the road.\\xa0 An open area with soldiers on two sides that might reflexively shoot if they spotted us.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t breathe, couldn\\u2019t see clearly, and my heart was hammering.\\xa0 A blind run, where I could get shot at any moment.</p>\\n<p>The smoke was thinning out too fast.</p>\\n<p>I heard a gunshot, and I heard the impact, very close by.</p>\\n<p>Lillian didn\\u2019t falter.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t hurdle over any dead Lambs.</p>\\n<p>Then, behind me, I heard the horn.</p>\\n<p>It cried out, a warning, that superweapons were on the field.\\xa0 <em>Hold your fire</em>.</p>\\n<p>Encouraged, I pressed on, tugging Lillian behind me.</p>\\n<p>The smoke and rain made it too hard to see a short distance ahead of me.\\xa0 I almost ran into the door, but Mary caught me, before reaching out to grab Lillian.</p>\\n<p>Gordon banged on the door.</p>\\n<p>Long seconds passed.</p>\\n<p>It cracked open, and we passed inside.</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/cat-out-of-the-bag-2-3/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>We entered the Academy.\\xa0 The road divided, with a loop moving around to the emergency entrance for the Hedge, and the main road continuing straight beneath a massive arch.\\xa0 I noted that double guard had been stationed between the emergency entrance and the archway.\\xa0 The men in uniform gave us wary glances, but Hayle, still trailing well behind our group, gave them a wave, and they let us through.</p>\\n<p>The way in was a gate with heavy doors.\\xa0 They were paneled with wood, but I knew from past experience and observation that the wood covered heavy steel.\\xa0 They were heavy, they were massive, and the idea was that they would stand up to a bomb blast if need be.\\xa0 If things came down to it, the Academy doubled as a fortress.</p>\\n<p>Pity about the town, but the Academy was built to stand tall through virtually any scenario.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t get much of a chance to talk,\\u201d I remarked to Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t think they wanted us to talk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can see that,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I thought about how Hayle had stressed that I shouldn\\u2019t play fast and loose with this particular job.\\xa0 Had he wanted to assert his own degree of control over Mary?\\xa0 How would he have done it?</p>\\n<p>Well, keeping us separated was a way.\\xa0 I\\u2019d promised that she wouldn\\u2019t have to be alone, and Hayle had forced me to break that promise, in a minor way.\\xa0 By showing my face I\\u2019d done what I could to convince her I was trying, but now it was time to follow through.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI remember overhearing you talk about how you hadn\\u2019t expected to deal with us,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou thought it would be Dog and Catcher, or one of the other experiments.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 We researched what we could, but things were hard to find.\\xa0 We didn\\u2019t want to tip anyone off,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She pulled her hand away from mine and adjusted her sweater, tugging at the side of her skirt, and very pointedly didn\\u2019t put her hand in mine again.</p>\\n<p>My mind raced through three immediate possibilities as to <em>why she\\u2019d </em>done that.\\xa0 She craved to belong somewhere; had she imprinted on the Academy, and was she now conscious of the Academy watching her expression and interaction with me?\\xa0\\xa0 That meant Hayle had won, in a way.\\xa0 She was his as much as she was mine.</p>\\n<p>Or had I made her uncomfortable, reminding her of the past and her past affiliations?\\xa0 That meant my grip was slipping, but it could be recouped.</p>\\n<p>Finally, it could be discomfort.\\xa0 Was she adopting a passive role?\\xa0 Subordinate, loyal, following my lead explicitly.\\xa0 If that was the case, then I had to be especially gentle.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm,\\u201d I said, calm and quiet, as if I\\u2019d been thinking about something else altogether.\\xa0 Then, not betraying my racing thoughts, I asked, \\u201cWhat was the plan to deal with them?\\xa0 Can I ask?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe had ideas.\\xa0 Stockpiles of weapons, traps.\\xa0 It\\u2019s hard, with the school being what it is, there aren\\u2019t many hiding places with that many people running around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you had things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMostly on the roof and in certain places in the basement.\\xa0 I had a stock of hair coloring and skunk musk, so I could go from brunette to blonde, throw them off the scent and then disappear into the crowd.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a myth,\\u201d I pointed out.\\xa0 \\u201cThe skunk urine.\\xa0 Perpetuated by the Academy.\\xa0 It only makes it easier for Dog to track you.\\xa0 Doesn\\u2019t slow him down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>One hand behind my back, I made a \\u2018come hither\\u2019 gesture.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 There was a pause.\\xa0 I noticed Gordon\\u2019s approach.\\xa0 Mary noted him coming up to walk on my right before she said, \\u201cIs it bad that that really bothers me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled, making a sound that was half-exhalation and half-laugh, raising my hand behind my back, a \\u2018stop\\u2019 gesture.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 That would drive me <em>nuts</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy more than most,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s one of the three best ways to put him in a foul mood, when a scheme of his doesn\\u2019t come together, past, present, or planned.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cScheme,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cUsing that word makes me think I should grow up to have a fishhook mustache I curl with my fingers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think that\\u2019s accurate,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>If it were Jamie, I would have jabbed him, started a light tussle, but it wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Gordon would make me look bad, and he would do it without trying.</p>\\n<p>Mary managed a proper smile for the first time today.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat are the other two ways to get to him?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon snickered, and there was something in the sound that betrayed his \\u2018nice boy\\u2019 image, hinting at the guy he really was.\\xa0 In a way, it was more honest, showing that side of himself, but it wasn\\u2019t gentle or nice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to give me something to get something,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWill I, now?\\u201d she asked, easily falling into the stride of the conversation. \\u201cI\\u2019ll have to keep that in mind.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>One day, not now but <em>soon</em>, I imagined he\\u2019d hone that hidden edge to a razor point.\\xa0 Used right, he could draw girls to him, good looks, build, and \\u2018knight in shining armor\\u2019 image to get their initial interest, then hinting at the secret beneath the surface to hook them.</p>\\n<p>Mary was too wary for the hook to set, barb and all, but she was intrigued enough to let walls down.\\xa0 Her shoulders were less tense now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re the hero of the Lambs.\\xa0 The vanguard,\\u201d Mary observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m nothing special,\\u201d he said, looking beyond me to give her a one-sided smirk that betrayed the lie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy said you were.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid he?\\xa0 Well, then it <em>must</em> be true,\\u201d Gordon said, softening the sarcasm with with a smile.\\xa0 Mary smiled back.\\xa0 \\u201cWhich direction are we going, again?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBowels, I\\u2019d think,\\u201d I said, pointing.\\xa0 I turned, starting to walk backward, raising my voice and pointing.\\xa0 \\u201cBowels?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hayle, just in earshot, nodded and pointed in the same direction.</p>\\n<p>We turned left.\\xa0 Claret hall was only a little ways to our right, bordered by other main buildings, the Rows, and various roads.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBowels,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cHaven\\u2019t heard that one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStudents call them the dungeons, the tunnels, or the pit.\\xa0 The official name is \\u2018Labs, comma, recessed\\u2019,\\xa0 Gorger\\u2019s home.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI heard about the dungeons and the tunnels,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She paused.\\xa0 \\u201cGorger.\\xa0 We didn\\u2019t have a plan for him.\\xa0 What could we even do, except scatter, run, and stick to the public eye?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d I said, noncommittal.\\xa0 \\u201cLet your guard down, he hits you like a freight train.\\xa0 Can\\u2019t hurt him with anything short of a proper cannon, and I doubt even <em>we</em> could contrive to get him to stand in the way of one for long enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m a little surprised it\\u2019s even a consideration,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ve clearly thought about it, weighed options, and decided you\\u2019d lose?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWrong on four counts,\\u201d I said, right off the back of her question.</p>\\n<p>I saw her pause, raising a hand to count on fingertips, rephrasing her question in her head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI haven\\u2019t given a lot of thought to that particular problem, so that stuff and everything that follows is off the top of my head.\\xa0 Gorger doesn\\u2019t get out much, so he\\u2019s one of the ones we see the <em>least</em> of, next to the Hangman.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHangman?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>I plowed on past the question, \\u201cSecond, I didn\\u2019t weigh options, I turned my thoughts to strategy-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cScheming,\\u201d Gordon said, sounding bored.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-and plotted-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSchemed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-the best way of doing things.\\xa0 <em>Third</em><em>ly</em>-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have to ignore him when he gets like this,\\u201d Gordon commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a loss, thank you very much.\\xa0 I think the cannon would be a failure, but that\\u2019s hardly the only way to do it.\\xa0 I\\u2019m betting a victory of sorts could be managed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThough he\\u2019s harder to ignore than I\\u2019d like,\\u201d Gordon remarked.\\xa0 \\u201cI agree with him there.\\xa0 I think we\\u2019d win.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s only three, and you\\u2019ve run out of points to argue,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cDid you say four to get me to pay attention?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>Because you\\u2019re insecure and you\\u2019re more likely to fixate on a proper number, which can be more easily proven or disproven.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 I thought I caught a roll of the eyes as she glanced away, looking over the Academy.\\xa0 The trees grew wild in between buildings, and there were places where the branches meshed with the branches that jutted out of buildings.\\xa0 There were more stitched at this end of the Academy, and more general experiments.\\xa0 It <em>was</em> interesting to look at.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPause for emphasis,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 Mary snapped her head around to look at him.\\xa0 He was smirking.\\xa0 \\u201cThen Sy\\u2019s reveal.\\xa0 There <em>was</em> a fourth reason.\\xa0 He never said there wasn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re ruining it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly because you\\u2019re predictable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I mock-gasped.\\xa0 \\u201cYou take that back, you <em>oaf.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t flinch.\\xa0 \\u201cBetter to be an oaf than to be <em>puny</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I mock-gasped again, with a little more emphasis.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFour?\\u201d Mary cut in, before we started fighting in earnest.</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cYou said <em>you</em>.\\xa0 That Gordon, Helen, Jamie, Lillian and I would lose if we were up against Gorger in some confrontation or another.\\xa0 Maybe you\\u2019re right.\\xa0 But that\\u2019s wrong.\\xa0 You\\u2019d have been more accurate if you\\u2019d said <em>we</em>.\\xa0 You\\u2019re a member of the team.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary turned my way.\\xa0 For someone else, the statement might have fallen flat, phrased as casually and awkwardly as it was, but the inclusiveness mattered to her.\\xa0 I\\u2019d touched on a topic at the core of her being.</p>\\n<p>I had her attention.\\xa0 I suspected that if I grabbed her hand, she wouldn\\u2019t pull away.</p>\\n<p>But suspicion wasn\\u2019t good enough.\\xa0 Not when I didn\\u2019t know why she\\u2019d pulled away in the first place.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d phrased it in a matter-of-fact way, leaving it to hang out there and be taken for what it was worth.\\xa0 Now I distracted from it.\\xa0 Better to avoid letting Mary sit with the idea and the statement long enough to doubt it or tear it to pieces.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re here,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe should let the others catch up and get the debrief.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary leaned over to peer down.</p>\\n<p>\\u2018Here\\u2019 happened to be a hole in the ground.\\xa0 It was a <em>nice</em> hole in the ground, with a roof over it and a short wall to keep the rain out.\\xa0 Lights punctuated a spiral stairway.\\xa0 An easy-to-miss plaque on a nearby wall indicated to those who were looking that this was the entrance to the Bowels.</p>\\n<p>Still, there were very few people who had cause to enter the Bowels without already knowing where and what it was.\\xa0 Guests didn\\u2019t tend to, unless they were from Academies other than Radham\\u2019s, and even regular students didn\\u2019t have much cause to go beneath.</p>\\n<p>Some students passed us, giving us weird looks, looking like they might say something, before they spotted Hayle following up the rear.</p>\\n<p>They hurried on, disappearing down the stairs, each with a hand on the rails.\\xa0 The descent was a nervous one, with stairs taken quickly, heads down and eyes fixed on points further down the stairs.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was holding the strap of her satchel with both hands.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout once every two weeks, they have to lock a whole section down.\\xa0 Something\\u2019s escaped, something went missing, a container broke, a chain broke.\\xa0 Send Gorger in, then seal it off.\\xa0 Drop stone blocks that whole teams of stitched have to winch back up, maybe flood the section, maybe ignite the air, and give it some time to be sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever it is,\\u201d Hayle said, \\u201cIf it\\u2019s here in the recessed labs, it\\u2019s likely better to be safe than sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever Dog, Catcher, Gorger and all the rest are hunting, it came from the Bowels, didn\\u2019t it?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt did,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe students that carried out the release are still down there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMakes sense,\\u201d Lillian said, in a small voice.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t think even the students that <em>work</em> down there like being down there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>It gets even better.\\xa0 With Gorger out and about, they don\\u2019t have anyone to clean up.\\xa0 If something happens, and they don\\u2019t flood or burn the section, they\\u2019ll just wait it out.\\xa0 Leave the section blocked off until everything inside has starved to death.\\xa0 Including us.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to come,\\u201d I told Lillian, knowing full well she did.</p>\\n<p>She smiled, a light of hope in her eyes as she looked to Hayle for confirmation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would insist that she accompany you,\\u201d Hayle said, shattering that hope.</p>\\n<p>Lillian\\u2019s face fell.</p>\\n<p>Hayle started down the stairs, and we followed.\\xa0 Hard shoes on stone stairs made for a bit of clatter, and the sounds echoed off the walls.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI assumed you\\u2019d ask about the job if you had questions,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cAre you wanting to go in blind, or did you want details?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDetails <em>now </em>are good,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease.\\xa0 Sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The sir sounded like an afterthought.\\xa0 Was Gordon a little irritated that Hayle had pushed about Lillian coming?</p>\\n<p>Gordon was being <em>protective</em>?\\xa0 Cute.</p>\\n<p>Then again, I had no place to comment.\\xa0 I was very aware of everything Mary was doing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe project is a living weapon, C-tier.\\xa0 It\\u2019s vat grown,\\xa0cartilaginous, with a simple construction.\\xa0 Redundant, durable organs, a thick exterior of placoid scales, and a brain diffused across its body mass.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>C-tier.\\xa0 Larger than a man, smaller than a coach car.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlacoid\\u2026 it\\u2019s covered in teeth?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn a fashion.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the angle?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSensory organs.\\xa0 Our creature is covered in fine, flexible \\u2018hairs\\u2019, with fine sawtooth construction.\\xa0 It can sense and process changes in air current, temperature, lighting, and vibrations in the atmosphere.\\xa0 It remains hyper-aware of its surroundings, and this is, we think, why it has proven so hard to track down and catch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSmart?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInstinctive intelligence.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFast?\\u201d Helen asked.\\xa0 \\u201cDangerous?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLess than you might think.\\xa0 It moves deliberately.\\xa0 It identifies lone prey and smashes itself against that prey.\\xa0 The hairs cut on contact, and the experiment uses its own mass to pulverize.\\xa0 It smears itself against destroyed prey to coat itself in blood and absorbs the nutrients through the gaps in the scaling.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat sounds really inefficient,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>Hayle smiled at her, pleased at how well his student was doing, but his words weren\\u2019t smiling words, \\u201cUnfortunately so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUnfortunately?\\u201d Helen cut in.\\xa0 She was doing that walk again, hands behind her back, almost playful, thunking her shoes against the stairs with each step.\\xa0 It was annoying, possibly trying to provoke a reaction, but our collective attention was elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it is that inefficient, then it has to do it more often,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven more often if it\\u2019s shy and bolts the moment someone comes to investigate the noise and screaming,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeven have died this morning,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t be surprised to hear about an eighth or a ninth when I return to my office.\\xa0 Six died on the Academy grounds, one died on the top of the outside wall.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLeading to concerns that it might have slipped through the net,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd the decision to bring more eyes in,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhich leads us <em>here</em>.\\xa0 Our culprits included one of the students on this project.\\xa0 He had a note with the time for release.\\xa0 We have the other students on the project, but we don\\u2019t believe they were involved.\\xa0 They\\u2019re available for you to talk to, of course.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d stepped away from the staircase.\\xa0 The hallways were brightly lit, which didn\\u2019t quite fit the \\u2018dungeon\\u2019 theme, but every wall was thicker than my arms were long, cut from slabs of stone, and the doors were heavy and reinforced.</p>\\n<p>I eyed the ceiling, looking at the notches, furrows, and larger pieces of stone that were held up by relatively small clasps and braces of metal.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t the only one looking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRemember.\\xa0 The students are your focus here,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re not equipped to deal with the escaped experiment.\\xa0 It instinctively slips away from anything and anyone that approaches, favoring darker, quieter areas, unless that <em>thing</em> or <em>someone </em>is both small and alone, in which case it feeds.\\xa0 There is no \\u2018fight\\u2019 to be had, here.\\xa0 <em>Focus on the students</em>.\\xa0 Motivations, ulterior motives, accomplices.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Gordon said, nodding.\\xa0 I joined in, despite wanting to add something along the lines of \\u2018I think he wants us to focus on the students\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>Had to be good.</p>\\n<p>We were quite a ways down the length of a hallway.\\xa0 A quartet of students saw Hayle and picked up their pace a little.</p>\\n<p>If a black-coat Professor was in the Bowels and walking fast, it was probably a good idea to pick up one\\u2019s pace and get out.\\xa0 Just in case.</p>\\n<p>Hayle stopped abruptly by a door.\\xa0 He plucked a file from a slot that was built into the door\\u2019s exterior, and handed it to Jamie, who opened it and started reading.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll find him in here.\\xa0 Walter Gund.\\xa0 Better than average student, his father is a politician in Wiltwyck, but he\\u2019s lost any and all favor he once enjoyed.\\xa0 Anything is permissible, so long as you don\\u2019t maim or kill the boy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Nods.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cQuestions?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We exchanged glances between us, then shook our collective heads.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know where to find me.\\xa0 <em>Be good</em>,\\u201d Hayle reminded us.\\xa0 Me, for that last part.\\xa0 He handed Gordon a key.</p>\\n<p>He left as quickly as he\\u2019d arrived.\\xa0 Leaving us to our own devices.</p>\\n<p>We watched as he made his retreat, his footsteps echoing down the hall.\\xa0 Just when we were clear, a group of students emerged from another room, opening the door and closing it behind them, looking stunned to see us gathered outside another office, then went on their way without kicking up a fuss.</p>\\n<p>Once <em>they\\u2019d</em> left, we were clear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShould one of us take point?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cOr we take turns?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKind of boring to be standing out in the hallway doing nothing,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cYes.\\xa0 That.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll of us take point?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll at once,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIntroduce him to the Lambs.\\xa0 And Lillian.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian gave me an annoyed look.\\xa0 Better than the waves of sheer terror that had been radiating off her a moment ago.</p>\\n<p>Mary wasn\\u2019t much better, but she had a better poker face.\\xa0 Almost flawless, as faces went.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, honey.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not so bad down here,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s pretty bad,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cAny place where you casually mention setting the air on fire as a just-in-case measure is pretty bad.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou put it in words better than I could have.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary smiled at her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI grew up here,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She was smiling, looking excited.\\xa0 \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t <em>born</em> here, I was harmless when they made me.\\xa0 But Doctor Ibott spent a lot of time observing and working down here, and he wanted me at arm\\u2019s reach.\\xa0 I think you can even find toys I hid from Ibott here and there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary maintained a very neutral expression at Helen\\u2019s casual mention that she\\u2019d grown up among the \\u2018if it escapes, drown and burn everything\\u2019 projects.\\xa0 I could have probably cracked her composure by mentioning what young Helen had deemed a \\u2018toy\\u2019, but stayed quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be happier when we\\u2019re gone,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo offense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded in solidarity.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo offense taken,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>Mary and Lillian were friends.\\xa0 For all my efforts, I hadn\\u2019t been able to see Mary as often as the girl who actually <em>lived</em> on Academy grounds.</p>\\n<p>It annoyed me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll at once, then,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cApproach?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s a good student,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cCitations for smoking in the dorm room-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie stopped as I reached out and tore the bottom of one page.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm.\\xa0 Lost my place.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s see\\u2026 Almost got kicked out, but the Academy dropped the issue.\\xa0 Being out and about with friends, drinking, in town for girls\\u2026 no issue.\\xa0 He\\u2019s only twenty-two, and he\\u2019s on a project like this.\\xa0 That suggests something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I rolled up the paper.\\xa0 I knew the answer, but didn\\u2019t give it.</p>\\n<p>Gordon looked at me, he was thinking the same thing.</p>\\n<p>I just prayed Lillian didn\\u2019t jump in with the answer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDaddy helped him out,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExactly,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He flashed a smile.</p>\\n<p>Mary smiled back.</p>\\n<p>I chimed in, \\u201cHe\\u2019s led a sheltered life.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s make it clear just how unsheltered his existence is now.\\xa0 Helen?\\xa0 You lead.\\xa0 Gordon, talk, I\\u2019ll signal you when I want a turn.\\xa0 Jamie?\\xa0 Jump in, facts from the folder.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd me?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe has a powerful dad.\\xa0 Are you telling me you didn\\u2019t pick anything up at Mothmont, when it comes to parental expectations and the wrath of Dad?\\xa0 Hit him where it hurts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReady?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Not hearing a \\u2018no\\u2019, he unlocked and opened the door.</p>\\n<p>The metal hinges of the heavy door creaked painfully as the door swung open.</p>\\n<p>Our man wore a handlebar mustache, and he was <em>big</em>, ginger-haired and broad shouldered, with no sign of a gut, despite his large arms.\\xa0 He\\u2019d been stripped of his coat, and now sat at the corner of the cot, one of only four pieces of furniture in the room \\u2013 cot, toilet, table, and chair.</p>\\n<p>No books, nothing to do with himself.</p>\\n<p>Walter stood as he saw us.\\xa0 I saw bewilderment, consternation.</p>\\n<p>Where the Bad Seeds had known who we were right away, this young man didn\\u2019t, I was certain.\\xa0 He saw a group of children, Helen smiling, Gordon glaring, Jamie and Mary with blank expressions.\\xa0 He looked to me, the smallest, as if I was somehow less threatening, and I gave him the coldest look I could manage.</p>\\n<p>Our group slowed, Gordon pausing to shut the door and lock it.\\xa0 Helen maintained course.\\xa0 She headed straight for him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen, smiling sweetly, grabbed him by the balls.</p>\\n<p>He staggered, but the movement didn\\u2019t break her grip.\\xa0 He swung, and she bent low, taking advantage of his height.\\xa0 She passed between his legs, almost <em>swinging</em>, pulling his dangling bits backward toward his asshole, and led him to bend far enough forward that he fell onto his hands and one knee.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you fight her, she\\u2019ll do permanent damage,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cEase up, Helen?\\xa0 I think he\\u2019s willing to cooperate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She eased up, but she didn\\u2019t let go.</p>\\n<p>He heaved for breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are we calling this thing, anyway?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhiskers,\\u201d I said, a moment before Helen called out, \\u201cFluffy!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie\\u2019s, \\u201cTwitches,\\u201d was so far behind it was closer to a fourth place finish than a third.</p>\\n<p>Mary glanced at me, confused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBit of a competition,\\u201d I whispered.\\xa0 \\u201cI tend to win these.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d she whispered back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk,\\u201d Gordon spoke to our hostage.\\xa0 \\u201cMotives.\\xa0 Start.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour dad knows,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ve talked to him.\\xa0 We explained.\\xa0 He\\u2019s done with you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hm.\\xa0 Right for the jugular.\\xa0 It fit the Mary I knew, but I had to give her a lesson in this.\\xa0 To properly break a person, one had to start at the outside edges, and work inward.\\xa0 Once you hit them with the worst possible scenario, there was little place left to go from there.</p>\\n<p>Still, it was interesting to get to know Mary on this level.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Walter said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t believe that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re the eldest son,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut when people die like people have been dying, and one\\u2019s <em>son</em> is responsible, sometimes a man has to face the fact that he\\u2019s raised a failure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re crawling on the ground with your balls in a little girl\\u2019s hands,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat do you think you are?\\xa0 The next Jacob Black?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I watched the man\\u2019s face change.\\xa0 I puzzled over it.\\xa0 The confusion.\\xa0 The reaction.</p>\\n<p>Ah.</p>\\n<p>I raised my hand, and saw Gordon\\u2019s head turn incrementally.</p>\\n<p>He passed the baton to me, in a manner of speaking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe know your dad is involved,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe sent someone after him, and we have him in custody.\\xa0 He\\u2019s throwing you out with the anchor, Walter.\\xa0 Talking is the only way to stay afloat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw his eyes widen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStart fast,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>His reaction had told me that something didn\\u2019t add up, and it was related to something we\\u2019d said already.</p>\\n<p>His dad was involved, a powerful politician, in another prominent city, no less.</p>\\n<p>Which raised <em>ever</em> so many questions.</p>\\n<p><a

repositioning and squashing Walter\\u2019s future children in the process.\\xa0 \\u201cAgh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStart talking, Walter,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cWe have all day.\\xa0 You most definitely don\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m think- thinking,\\u201d Walter said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of hard when-\\xa0 Ow!\\xa0 Augh.\\xa0 I might\\u2026 throw up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t,\\u201d I commented, still giving our man a cold, dead look.\\xa0 \\u201cEvery second counts.\\xa0 You need to give us something your father won\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat- who <em>are</em> you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not helping you, Walter,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou need to focus on the answers, not on coming up with questions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2026 what do you want to know?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s another question!\\u201d Helen chimed in, chirpy and cheerful, sounding just like a little girl on Christmas morning.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUrrgh!\\u201d Walter grunted.\\xa0 He kicked, twisting, very possibly deciding the momentary agony was worth pulling himself free of Helen\\u2019s grip.</p>\\n<p>He was underestimating how strong Helen\\u2019s grip could be.</p>\\n<p>The pain was bad enough that he did follow through on his promise of throwing up.\\xa0 I winced a little in sympathy.</p>\\n<p>Mary leaned closer to me.\\xa0 She murmured in my ear, \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you send her after us like that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHer musculature and joints are different,\\u201d I murmured back.\\xa0 \\u201cIn configuration and type.\\xa0 Mostly, she\\u2019s bad at exerting a lot of strength very quickly.\\xa0 She\\u2019s almost weaker than me when it comes to throwing proper punches, and that\\u2019s with her being bigger than me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s <em>almost</em> weaker,\\u201d Jamie remarked, leaning in to join the conversation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI <em>said</em> almost!\\u201d I protested, annoyed.\\xa0 \\u201cGeez.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGive her a few years and some practice, maybe she\\u2019ll be dangerous in a scrap,\\u201d Jamie said, ignoring me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf she can get her hands on someone, we\\u2019re good,\\u201d I said, not taking my eyes off Helen.\\xa0 \\u201cYou could use a prybar and you wouldn\\u2019t make her let go, and the sudden strength she <em>can</em> employ lets her take advantage of any openings.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We watched our man flounder.\\xa0 He was only just finishing puking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI-I thought there was going to be a trial,\\u201d Walter finally said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho do you think we are?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>We\\u2019re</em> your trial, Walter.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Walter managed to focus, raising his head to peer at Gordon through disheveled red hair.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re the Judge\\u2026\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Really, really, hoping someone else would pick up the tail end of the statement.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJury,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p><em>I love you, Jamie</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd executioners,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p><em>You\\u2019re awesome, Mary.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf need be,\\u201d Gordon tacked on.</p>\\n<p><em>Eh.\\xa0 You\\u2019re alright, Gordon.</em></p>\\n<p>It made sense, to give the man a little hope, maybe, but I would have rather ratcheted up the tension another notch or two.\\xa0 As it stood, the man looked like he couldn\\u2019t wrap his head around the idea, and Gordon\\u2019s softening of the blow wasn\\u2019t helping to hammer it through and make Walter\\u2019s situation crystal clear in his very confused mind.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExecutioner?\\u201d\\xa0 Walter asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou intentionally freed your little project, Wally,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cGorger is out doing what Gorger does.\\xa0 You know what Gorger does, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe cleans up messes,\\u201d Lil said, when Walter didn\\u2019t respond quick enough.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe cleans up messes,\\u201d I said, staring Walter down.\\xa0 \\u201cWell, Gorger\\u2019s doing just that.\\xa0 But while he\\u2019s away, we\\u2019re here.\\xa0 Filling in his shoes.\\xa0 Are you going to help, Wally, or are you going to be a mess that Gorger\\u2019s temporary replacements need to clean up?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw the light dawning in Wally\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 The realization.</p>\\n<p><em>Yeah.\\xa0 You\\u2019re in a much, much worse situation than you thought.\\xa0 All the pieces are fitting together.\\xa0 You were wondering who these children are, and now I\\u2019ve connected the dots for you.\\xa0 The only way it all makes sense is if we\\u2019re with the Academy, same as Gorger is.\\xa0 When we talk about being possible executioners, you now know we\\u2019re telling the truth.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Now how are you going to react, knowing more than just your balls and dignity are on the line?</em></p>\\n<p>It was visible across his body.\\xa0 The adrenaline rush, the fight-or-flight response.</p>\\n<p>He was a big guy, and as launched himself into a mindset that was all \\u2018survival\\u2019, the pain of being crushed between the legs apparently disappeared.\\xa0 He flipped himself over, so he was on his back rather than all fours, and kicked at Helen.</p>\\n<p>I winced at that.\\xa0 Not because Helen couldn\\u2019t take a bit of abuse, but because Ibott would get fussy and maybe hit me again.\\xa0 That last bruise had taken a week to fade.</p>\\n<p>Helen was like a rag doll, sagging, leaning heavily to one side, letting herself be flexible enough that the relaxed motion absorbed the impact more than her head did.</p>\\n<p>Walter lurched forward, slamming Helen against the wall, forearm against her throat.</p>\\n<p>Mary started, as if she was going to run forward.\\xa0 I put my hand out, stopping her.</p>\\n<p>Walter was tall, and he was muscular, probably someone who did sports to get away from the hassles and stresses of spending much of the week in the Bowels.\\xa0 With his ruddy complexion, it was probably something like horseback riding or a field sport.\\xa0 His belly suggested that it wasn\\u2019t <em>all</em> muscle, either.\\xa0 Women tended to like a guy with a barrel chest, broad shoulders, and Walter was very much that.</p>\\n<p>All in all, our man was fourteen stone, maybe.\\xa0 Maybe as much as seventeen.\\xa0 Helen was less than half his weight, and he was leaning hard, the vast majority of his weight pinning her down, pressing down on her windpipe.\\xa0 It made for an awkward, hunched position, as Helen still hadn\\u2019t let go of him.</p>\\n<p>Frantic, a little nervous, Walter looked back over one shoulder.\\xa0 Worried about being attacked from behind.</p>\\n<p>Gordon hadn\\u2019t moved from the side of the table.\\xa0 Lil, Mary, Jamie and I were all by the door.</p>\\n<p>Nobody was moving a muscle to react.\\xa0 Even Mary had relaxed at my suggestion.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is looking more like a mess that really needs to be cleaned up,\\u201d Gordon commented, calm.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t hurt him too badly, Helen.\\xa0 Even if he doesn\\u2019t decide to talk, the Academy could use him for raw materials.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t resist smirking at that line.\\xa0 It was a good one.\\xa0 Very <em>Gordon</em>.</p>\\n<p>Walter turned back to Helen, and found her smiling, sweet as she ever was, while he tried and failed to crush her throat, strangling her.</p>\\n<p>Slowly, he began to slip, huffing, panting, tearing at the eyes.\\xa0 His arm moved, jerking.\\xa0 He started to groan, and the groan became a scream.</p>\\n<p>Then he broke away, releasing her, falling onto his back.\\xa0 One of his legs was twitching, as if the pain was bad enough it couldn\\u2019t stay still.</p>\\n<p>Helen released him, then grabbed one leg, holding it still while she wiped the blood off of her hand, where it had seeped through cloth.\\xa0 She apparently didn\\u2019t think he was up to putting up a fight.</p>\\n<p>She flashed a smile to our little group by the door, rubbing at her throat.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t seem to be having trouble breathing.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, for his part, stood over Walter, looking down.\\xa0 Walter would be seeing him upside down.\\xa0 The man was heaving in breaths.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPeople died, Walter,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe blame is going to fall on your shoulders.\\xa0 Other students are going to think it makes them look bad.\\xa0 The Academy is going to want to make an example of you.\\xa0 Just to be safe.\\xa0 Because this sort of thing can\\u2019t happen again.\\xa0 Not with regularity, not ever.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Walter shook his head.</p>\\n<p>I chimed in.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen a mistake happens, that\\u2019s bad.\\xa0 But intentional sabotage?\\xa0 Boy oh boy, Walter.\\xa0 Not good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd\\u2026 I\\u2019m supposed to talk, get you to take\\u2026 take it easier on me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat ship might have sailed,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut given where you are right now?\\xa0 Circumstances and all?\\xa0 I\\u2019d <em>really</em> recommend trying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2026 we spent a long time talking about it.\\xa0 Hypotheticals.\\xa0 What if.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat if you let something loose?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Walter nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cWe, my dad and I, we\\u2026 I almost didn\\u2019t attend the Academy.\\xa0 There were problems, my\\u2026 dad never liked it.\\xa0 But we thought I\\u2019d join, I\\u2019d see how it was, what could be done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDestroy it from within?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Walter made a face, like he was going to laugh, but there was only pain and agony instead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 We didn\\u2019t think that big.\\xa0 The Crown has come closer than anyone, <em>anything, </em>to actually controlling the world.\\xa0 The Academies are what let them do it, mostly.\\xa0 I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m strong, smart, but not so damn deluded that I think I can <em>destroy</em> them, damn it.\\xa0 <em>Damn it</em>.\\u201d\\xa0 His voice cracked with those last two words.\\xa0 Emotion.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTake them down a peg, maybe,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Walter nodded a little.\\xa0 He let out a little whimper of a sound, looked over toward me, Jamie, and Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cWas going to steal some books, make a run for it, go to another country, sell the knowledge for enough to get rich.\\xa0 My father had everything ready, I thought.\\xa0 But I didn\\u2019t get far enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEvery student thinks about how much they could get for the sort of knowledge the Academy has,\\u201d Jamie said, holding his book and the file that Hayle had given us.\\xa0 \\u201cNot many actually try it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s suicidal,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou <em>had</em> to know you\\u2019d get caught.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe talked ourselves into it,\\u201d Walter said, he gave us a smile, one that was awfully sad.\\xa0 Self-pitying.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust you and your dad?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s as far as it went?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Walter made a sound of pain, by way of response.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t really make sense,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cHim going this far, using his own son as a tool, then <em>discarding</em> his son as soon as he got caught.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>It doesn\\u2019t make sense because it\\u2019s a lie</em>, I thought, tensing up a little bit.\\xa0 <em>Maybe we shouldn\\u2019t make Wally think too hard about it</em>.</p>\\n<p>Walter wasn\\u2019t responding.\\xa0 I wondered if he was in the process of passing out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy did he care so much about the Academy?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p><em>Still pushing\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2026 he\\u2019s powerful, he\\u2019s rich, but he\\u2019s only a man in the middle,\\u201d Walter responded.\\xa0 \\u201cServant to the people, servant to the Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cServant,\\u201d Jamie echoed him.</p>\\n<p>Walter nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd it bothers him so much he\\u2019d sacrifice you as a pawn,\\u201d Mary said, her voice soft.</p>\\n<p><em>Was Mary clutching too hard to her past, failing to see and interpret this situation for what it was?</em></p>\\n<p>If it was the case, if I couldn\\u2019t fix it, then she was useless to us.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d have to <em>discard</em> her, and I\\u2019d have to admit to Hayle that I\\u2019d been wrong to invite her.</p>\\n<p>I was in the process of trying to analyze that situation when I realized that Walter hadn\\u2019t replied.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Jamie, then Gordon, then Helen.</p>\\n<p>Were they all thinking the same thing I was?</p>\\n<p>I decided to prod, knowing it was no longer Mary that was risking pushing him too far and shattering our deception here, but me.\\xa0 If I got this wrong, it would be <em>my</em> fault.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Lil, \\u201cWant to step outside and pass that on?\\xa0 If Wally Gund\\u2019s daddy is that angry, it\\u2019s something they can use in the interrogation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lil frowned, but nodded.</p>\\n<p>Gordon withdrew the key from his pocket and threw it.</p>\\n<p>Our field medic moved to catch it.\\xa0 Mary seemed to sense that Lillian would miss, and caught it instead, before handing it over.</p>\\n<p>Lillian smiled at Mary before letting herself out.</p>\\n<p>Our man, crumpled on the ground, fearing for his life, red faced and sweating, was watching the door, focusing on Lillian, who had just left.</p>\\n<p>Huh.</p>\\n<p>Why did it feel like Walter was the one concerned with this lie about his father standing up?\\xa0 Not about himself, not about reconciling who his dad was, or the betrayal\\u2026</p>\\n<p>He was lying about something.</p>\\n<p>Gordon opened his mouth to speak, I moved my hand, where it was right by my pocket, a small spreading of my fingers, and the motion was enough to catch Gordon\\u2019s eye.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me, Wally, do you really think what you\\u2019ve given us is good enough?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s true!\\u201d Walter said, suddenly alarmed.</p>\\n<p>People rarely sounded more like they were lying than when they protested like that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Maybe,</em>\\u201d I said, stressing the word.\\xa0 \\u201cBut it\\u2019s not the whole truth.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what you want from me,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 I stepped closer, spreading my arms a little.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t want much of anything.\\xa0 I admit, it would be easier if you talked and gave us something juicy.\\xa0 I could take whatever you said to people who matter, and that would make for less clean up work for us.\\xa0 The only thing that matters here is you.\\xa0 The only one you can depend on is you.\\xa0 The one who suffers the worst the Academy has to offer, if you don\\u2019t convince your jury here\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly, putting my hands in my pockets.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not supposed to talk about what happens down in the Bowels of the Academy,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut people do it anyway, don\\u2019t they?\\xa0 You know the sort of things the Academy can do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was starting to break, now.\\xa0 I could see it.</p>\\n<p>Before long we could well have a grown man weeping.</p>\\n<p>I could have said it was okay, if only because he\\u2019d killed people by releasing Whiskers, but the truth was I didn\\u2019t care all that much.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t feel <em>bad</em>, no pit in my stomach, no pain for my fellow man.</p>\\n<p>Maybe a bit of sympathy pain for what Helen had done to him, but that was something else altogether.</p>\\n<p>He was only another job.</p>\\n<p>The door lock clicked, and the door opened.\\xa0 It was heavy enough that Mary had to help Lil to pull it open.\\xa0 She rejoined us.</p>\\n<p>I held my hand where Walter couldn\\u2019t see it, and beckoned Lil.</p>\\n<p>She hesitated, most likely because she didn\\u2019t trust me, but she did eventually summon the courage to come close.\\xa0 I leaned close, and managed to make it look like her bringing her mouth to my ear was <em>her</em> idea.</p>\\n<p>To Lil\\u2019s credit, she got what I was trying to do.\\xa0 She whispered in my ear, \\u201cIt\\u2019s really creepy being out in the hallway alone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t <em>smirk</em>,\\u201d she whispered, sounding annoyed.</p>\\n<p>I turned to Walter, as if it was a logical progression from the whispering.\\xa0 \\u201cYour dad is talking.\\xa0 There are others involved.\\xa0 He hasn\\u2019t named names, but he will.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe-\\u201d Walter started.\\xa0 He stopped himself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe what?\\u201d I asked, noting that Walter hadn\\u2019t told me I was wrong.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t think he\\u2019ll say?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI agree with my friend there,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI want to do this without blood and cleaning.\\xa0 It means I can go back outside and enjoy the nicest day Radham has seen since last fall.\\xa0 Your father <em>will</em> talk.\\xa0 He\\u2019ll continue selling you upriver, and he\\u2019ll name names.\\xa0 Do us all a favor, here.\\xa0 Talk.\\xa0 Share what we need to share, our Academy student over there has the skill and the tools to mend some of the damage Helen did to you and give you complete and total relief from the pain, you get to live, and we get to go out and enjoy a very nice day.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t-\\u201d Walter said.\\xa0 I was suspecting we\\u2019d pushed him too far.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t operating like he should.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere is no good ending if you don\\u2019t wake up and <em>act</em>,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cStop thinking of him like a father.\\xa0 Start focusing on yourself.\\xa0 That\\u2019s all you should do right now.\\xa0 Focus on <em>you.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd us,\\u201d I pointed out.\\xa0 \\u201cJudge, jury, blah blah.\\xa0 Getting on our good side is smart.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t-\\u201d Walter said again.</p>\\n<p><em>Is he completely broken?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t need her help,\\u201d Walter said, looking at Lil.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m Academy trained.\\xa0 I\\u2019m older.\\xa0 I can do the work myself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Got him</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re assuming we\\u2019ll let you have tools to attack us with,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Walter paled visibly, making the redness in his cheeks, chin, and the center of his forehead more pronounced.\\xa0 Fear.\\xa0 He was in the palm of our hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s voice was calm, gentle, \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine.\\xa0 You can have everything you want.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll let you patch yourself up, administer the medication.\\xa0 We can even leave you something, if you want help sleeping, so you don\\u2019t have to lie awake wondering what\\u2019s going to happen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t let you leave, of course,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf\\u2026 course, yes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow, before we get a call and a knock on the door saying that your father spilled the beans\\u2026\\u201d I said, trailing off.</p>\\n<p>Walter hung his head.\\xa0 \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t father who instigated it.\\xa0 He and I were roped in together.\\xa0 My access, my father\\u2019s money and resources.\\xa0 My friend, he works on other projects, but he was part of it too.\\xa0 Keller.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He seemed to find the singling out of his friend the hardest thing to do.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe instigator was a man called Reverend Mauer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s local,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs of recently.\\xa0 He wanted more access to\\u2026 he dislikes the Academy.\\xa0 He says it\\u2019s a perversion.\\xa0 Which it <em>is</em>, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you calling me a perversion?\\u201d Helen asked, still in her best \\u2018good girl\\u2019 voice.</p>\\n<p>Again, Walter paled.</p>\\n<p>I signaled Helen to back off, a flick of my fingers, as if I were shooing something away.\\xa0 Hands behind her back, she sauntered backward until she stood in a corner.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep talking,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Walter nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s not about stopping the Academy.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think <em>anyone</em> can do that, even the Academy itself.\\xa0 Even the Crown.\\xa0 But if we could make people <em>wake up, </em>let them know what\\u2019s happening inside the walls of the Academies, here in the dungeons, other things in other areas\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He trailed off, as he stared at Gordon.</p>\\n<p>One of those other things.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026There\\u2019s no way you let me go,\\u201d Walter belatedly realized.\\xa0 He looked at each of us in turn.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou killed people.\\xa0 Academy students.\\xa0 Some were connected, some weren\\u2019t.\\xa0 Some of the people you tried to wake up are going to die, if we can\\u2019t stop\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhiskers,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhiskers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Walter said.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was acting like he was very, very tired.\\xa0 I might have suspected blood loss, but it was more likely his emotions had taken too many turns, and now he was running out of steam.\\xa0 It was <em>defeat</em> that was the telling blow, here.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou weren\\u2019t thinking,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t seem like a man with a plan.\\xa0 You were convinced to take action, your dad joined in.\\xa0 Your friend, too.\\xa0 How do you step back and realize what you\\u2019re doing is wrong, when everyone around you is caught up in it, agreeing with it and spurring you on?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026Yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen you think back to the person or thing that was pushing you forward the hardest, stepping in when you started to have doubts, was it the Pastor?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMauer?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>Walter nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou told him things you shouldn\\u2019t?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Another nod.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThings the Academy would prefer were kept under wraps.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Nod.</p>\\n<p>Gordon looked at Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201cYou know where this guy is?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 Hear about him sometimes.\\xa0 If I think about it, I think I even know his routine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood man,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell us about the monster, Walter,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat was the end goal?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMeans to an end,\\u201d Walter said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s all.\\xa0 We wanted to do work on senses, but we couldn\\u2019t get budget without giving the Academy a weapon.\\xa0 We made\\u2026 Whiskers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaking it a weapon, you had to justify it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow it operates, how it\\u2019s meant to be used.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLow cost from raw to vat.\\xa0 Relatively short time.\\xa0 They come out at half size, and steadily grow over the course of days as long as food is available.\\xa0 After a few more development cycles, we thought it could be something we mass produced, dropped or deployed near enemy lines.\\xa0 Up pressure, soldiers can\\u2019t go to use the latrine alone, have to move in groups of two or three if there are full sized \\u2018Whiskers\\u2019 around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust tell us it\\u2019s not pregnant,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Walter shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cMale.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I exhaled in relief.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo tricks to catching it?\\xa0 Weak points?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Walter said.\\xa0 \\u201cFire, maybe.\\xa0 Even then, I\\u2019m not sure, and it can sense heat from one hundred and fifty meters away, even ambient body heat.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re going to catch it.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think the <em>Academy </em>is going to catch it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you said something about other development cycles,\\u201d Lil said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy?\\xa0 If it\\u2019s that good, why did it need more work?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLifespan,\\u201d Walter said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell us it\\u2019s hours,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>He shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cWeeks.\\xa0 Maybe months.\\xa0 We never got around to it with this version.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I exchanged glances with the others.</p>\\n<p>A long moment passed, and nobody volunteered any more questions.</p>\\n<p>Gordon walked away from Walter, gesturing at Lillian.</p>\\n<p>Lillian, for her part, stepped over to the table, reached into her bag, and fished out a syringe and two small pills.\\xa0 They were lumpy; she\\u2019d probably made the pills herself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNeedle for the pain,\\u201d she said, as she continued rummaging in her bag.\\xa0 \\u201cPills for sleep.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve got a fresh, sharp scalpel I was saving for surgery.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo scalpel.\\xa0 Nothing he could use on himself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\xa0 Oh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHayle or the other professors might want something more from him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe syringe is probably a bad idea too,\\u201d Lil said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m going to use it and then take it with me, okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Walter nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou won\\u2019t grab me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shook his head.</p>\\n<p>When Lil turned around to double check, it was <em>me</em> she looked at.\\xa0 I was a little surprised.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Lillian ejected a bit of fluid from the needle, bent down and used her fingers to measure spacing, touching the base of Walter\\u2019s gut.\\xa0 She jabbed the needle in, then depressed the plunger.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t move or grab at her as she finished up and backed away.</p>\\n<p>She <em>fled</em> back to us, double time, finding safety in the assembled group.</p>\\n<p>Gordon opened the door, we stepped out into the hallway, and we waited while he locked the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMauer lives and works at the church on Flax avenue,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll update Hayle before we leave,\\u201d Gordon decided.</p>\\n<p>We moved in formation, heading for the spiral staircase.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was good work.\\xa0 Really.\\xa0 I had doubts, but\\u2026 good job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary didn\\u2019t seem able to find words.\\xa0 She nodded, a little too fast.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought you were going too hard on him, but turned out to be just right,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>She had to turn around to give me a smile, and it proved to be a hesitant one, as if she thought I might pull a \\u2018just joking!\\u2019 on her.\\xa0 But I didn\\u2019t say anything more, and she smiled again, with the expression sticking this time.</p>\\n<p>Jamie reached out and tapped Mary\\u2019s head with his book.\\xa0 She flinched, maybe a bit too much, but then she saw his small smile.\\xa0 The playfulness.</p>\\n<p>He hugged his book, and she turned away, walking with a bit more bounce in her step, close enough to Lillian that their arms touched.\\xa0 The camaraderie there was already established.</p>\\n<p>Helen, walking beside me, was the only one who didn\\u2019t say anything, but she was the furthest one from Mary, in a manner of speaking.</p>\\n<p>Still, I didn\\u2019t need to interfere.\\xa0 Better to let her have her taste of the group, like this.\\xa0 If we could give her a sense of belonging that she hadn\\u2019t had with the puppeteer, there was a possibility that he could come back, reaching out, and she wouldn\\u2019t want to leave.</p>\\n<p>As a group, the six of us headed up the stairs, back to the closest thing to daylight that Radham ever got to enjoy.</p>\\n<p><em>Off to see our Reverend Mauer</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>He has the ears of the masses, a way with words, and a hell of a lot to say.</em></p>\\n<p><strong><a

picked up my hood and pulled it over my wet hair.</p>\\n<p>A little petulantly, I pulled it back down.\\xa0 I glared at him.</p>\\n<p>Rick, one of the older boys at Lambsbridge, only smiled.\\xa0 Back when he\\u2019d arrived at the orphanage he had taken me for someone much younger.\\xa0 He\\u2019d quickly realized how much I hated it when I wasn\\u2019t taken seriously and decided to kill me with kindness.</p>\\n<p>He looked the part, too.\\xa0 Where Gordon was big in the athletic sense, Rick was round-chinned, wide-hipped, with a heavy, dense body.\\xa0 He might have looked like a proper Bruno if his face wasn\\u2019t so damned innocent; rosy cheeked, bright eyed and clear-skinned for a fifteen year old.</p>\\n<p>To the adults, he was <em>cuddly</em>.\\xa0 To me, he was a nuisance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey, Gordon, can I grab that extra umbrella?\\u201d Rick asked.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Helen were walking together, each holding large umbrellas, a herd of the younger orphans walking around them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think Sy would prefer it if you left him alone,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s going to get sick if he gets this cold and wet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s <em>summer,</em>\\u201d I pointed out.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s <em>warm</em> rain, and I <em>want</em> to get wet.\\xa0 I\\u2019m changing when I get back anyway.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy would you want to get wet?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy is it any of your business?\\xa0 My head gets hot, I like to cool down sometimes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour head gets hot?\\u201d Rick asked.\\xa0 He gave me an indulgent smile.\\xa0 \\u201cI think you\\u2019re already feverish, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave him a very unimpressed look, then ducked around a pair of recent arrivals, aiming to put them between me and Rick.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t work.\\xa0 I felt a hand grip my hood, and spun on the spot, slapping at it, harder than was necessary.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t have much effect, but it made for a loud slap, and the speed with which I\\u2019d turned caught eyes.\\xa0 Other children and a few bystanders on the street were staring, now.\\xa0 The Lambsbridge group slowed, some stopping altogether.</p>\\n<p>I stared Rick down, glaring.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou need to take better care of yourself,\\u201d Rick said, in the nicest tone imaginable.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can.\\xa0 I do.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t need you to step in and tell me how,\\u201d I said, my voice tight.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t move, still staring daggers at Rick.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve got my hands full with my book and this umbrella, and I need to scratch my nose,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cCan you give me a hand?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned my back on Rick, and advanced to the front of the group, where Jamie was walking alongside Eliza and Fran, the only two girls around our age that weren\\u2019t Helen, and all three of them were carrying large umbrellas to shelter themselves and a few small children from the water.\\xa0 I reached up and scratched his nose for him.\\xa0 He scrunched it up suitably, provoking a laugh from some of the smallest children in the herd.</p>\\n<p>Breaking tension.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI meant for you to take my umbrella,\\u201d he said, but he was smiling a little.\\xa0 He started walking, and our group started moving again.\\xa0 I took the umbrella from him, holding it with both hands and falling in step\\xa0 between him and Fran, prompting a, \\u201cThank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPut his hood up, Jamie,\\u201d Rick said.</p>\\n<p>I tensed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRick,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cC\\u2019mere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s help served to put Rick at the tail end of the group, while Jamie had me at the front.\\xa0 The kids in the middle were splashing in puddles.\\xa0 Altogether, we took up most of the sidewalk and some of the street.</p>\\n<p>It was the middle of the afternoon, and it was about as far from gloomy as Radham got, with sunlight pushing at but not yet breaking through the clouds overhead.\\xa0 The rain <em>was</em> warm to the touch, and about half of the people on the street were doing just what I was doing, keeping hoods down and umbrellas away.</p>\\n<p>Discount the stitched that were here and there, like the group that was leading one large, almost featureless, hairless mammal in the direction of the Academy, and maybe two thirds of the people were enjoying the rain.</p>\\n<p>Which <em>Rick </em>didn\\u2019t seem able to understand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe really gets to you, huh?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe <em>should</em> get to everyone,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s something seriously <em>bent</em> in his head, and the fact that nobody but me understands that is a bigger bother than <em>he</em> is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRick isn\\u2019t a bad guy, he\\u2019s just awkward,\\u201d Fran said, beside me.</p>\\n<p>I pulled one hand away from the umbrella to gesture at her, giving Jamie my best \\u2018<em>see!?</em>\\u2018 look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI sort of understand,\\u201d Jamie said, gently.\\xa0 \\u201cI do see elements of it.\\xa0 I also think you exaggerate it to make it something it isn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI understand people,\\u201d I said, being very careful with my words.\\xa0 The other orphans did not know who or what we were, and the wrong phrasing could be disastrous.\\xa0 \\u201cI know what makes them tick.\\xa0 I know how to <em>use</em> that.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve had to know all that, because\\u2026 of where I came from.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve told you this, and more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, I know,\\u201d Jamie said, just as careful.\\xa0 He knew what I really meant.\\xa0 Fran and Eliza were decorous enough not to pry or ask about my past, though I saw them exchange glances between each other.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s not dwell too much on the bad stuff with the small ones around,\\u201d Eliza said.</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t <em>get</em> Rick.\\xa0 I can push, I can prod, I can test him, and he doesn\\u2019t budge.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe knows you just as well as you know him,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re clever, Sy, but don\\u2019t underestimate just how effective the average person is when they\\u2019re one hundred percent focused on one thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s one hundred percent focused on <em>me</em>?\\xa0 And you don\\u2019t see what\\u2019s wrong with that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you blame him?\\xa0 You met each other on one of your bad days, one of the days when you\\u2019re in particularly foul, spiteful moods-\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>After an appointment</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-and forced him to figure out how to deal with you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich he did,\\u201d I muttered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich means he doesn\\u2019t give in, he doesn\\u2019t change course.\\xa0 You made your bed, Sy.\\xa0 Now you get to sleep in it.\\xa0 Go after people and don\\u2019t be surprised if they fight back the best ways they know how.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I scowled, \\u201cIf I had a <em>clue</em>, some inkling of what makes a person that fundamentally messed up\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Sylvester</em>!\\u201d Fran rebuked me with enough force that the children we were walking with jumped a little.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t be unkind!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d I mumbled, shrinking down a little.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m just saying.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t get him.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know what adds up to Rick being Rick.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>I</em> know,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know his story.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was immediately a puppy, eyes bright, ears perked up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd I\\u2019m not going to tell you,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cEver.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause you\\u2019ll <em>use</em> it.\\xa0 I know you.\\xa0 Let it lie and deal with it as best as you can.\\xa0 It\\u2019s good for you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I fought the urge to smack Jamie with the umbrella I was holding.\\xa0 I only managed to avoid it by telling myself that Jamie had to have written it down in one of his notebooks.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not in my diaries, Sy,\\u201d Jamie said, quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cWell, it is, but I blotted the words out after you threw the cup at his head, just a bit before Christmas.\\xa0 I knew you\\u2019d look eventually.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The annoyances of dealing with someone who knew you well enough to predict how you <em>thought.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was about to ask if you\\u2019d <em>really</em> read his diary,\\u201d Fran said, \\u201cBut then I thought, gosh, silly me, it\\u2019s <em>Sylvester</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed.\\xa0 I considered hitting the both of them with the umbrella, but then I caught sight of Jamie\\u2019s expression.\\xa0 Light concern, caring.\\xa0 Gentleness.</p>\\n<p><em>Jamie\\u2019s so slow he wouldn\\u2019t ever get out of the way fast enough.\\xa0 Not sporting, </em>I told myself.</p>\\n<p>He moved his book to his other arm and put an arm around my shoulders.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan you give Sy and me a moment?\\xa0 We\\u2019re just going to walk ahead a bit,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll watch the ankle biters,\\u201d Fran said, taking the umbrella from me, holding one in each hand.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t miss the smile on her face as she said it.</p>\\n<p>Jamie gave her a curt nod.\\xa0 We picked up our pace to pull ahead, which wasn\\u2019t too much of a problem, considering how slow a collection of five year olds sometimes were.\\xa0 He moved his book so it was more out of the rain.\\xa0 I reached over to pull his rain-cloak over it.</p>\\n<p>It took a minute before we were out of earshot.\\xa0 We had to circle around a slow-moving obstacle.\\xa0 The obstacle took the form of a large glass case the size of a coach, a cloth thrown over the top, already soaked with the water that sloshed within.\\xa0 Live horses were pulling the thing, and the Academy students who weren\\u2019t leading the horses were holding formation in a loose circle around the tank, warding off incoming traffic so a coach didn\\u2019t crash into the side.</p>\\n<p>When we were on the other side, I commented, \\u201cRick\\u2019s the sort of guy who ends up dressing in his mom\\u2019s clothes and smiles as he kills his victims with a knitting needle or something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not going to bait an answer out of me, Sy,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot a knitting needle.\\xa0 But something inventive,\\u201d I mused.\\xa0 \\u201cCommon household item.\\xa0 You\\u2019re the one that reads the books.\\xa0 What item fits?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re more agitated than usual,\\u201d Jamie told me.\\xa0 \\u201cI think high-strung is the term.\\xa0 I\\u2019m guessing it\\u2019s Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to act so smug.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not being smug,\\u201d Jamie said, giving me every indication that he really believed what he was saying.\\xa0 \\u201cLook, it\\u2019s been a few weeks.\\xa0 You have a tendency to want to steer the ship, even if Gordon is supposed to be the one captaining it.\\xa0 I know you haven\\u2019t been that able to steer <em>Mary</em>\\xa0as much as you\\u2019d like, despite your <em>very</em> frequent visits.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told Hayle everything,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie was giving me a look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Almost</em> everything.\\xa0 I explained, I got him to agree and get Mary\\u2019s oversight to cooperate.\\xa0 Yet half the time I couldn\\u2019t even talk to her, because they were doing stuff with her or with her parents<em>.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded, taking it in, storing it, maybe processing something else, or paging through a set of memories in his head.\\xa0 \\u201cYou weren\\u2019t that successful when you did see her.\\xa0 It\\u2019s why you\\u2019re so insecure now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not <em>insecure</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t sound much like he believed me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe did try to kill you,\\u201d I pointed out.\\xa0 \\u201cIf this goes an ugly way, then she might try again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe came closer to killing you than she did to killing me,\\u201d Jamie pointed out.\\xa0 \\u201cSeveral times, in fact.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re trying to make me join you in the hand-wringing, you\\u2019ll have to do better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re no fun,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He squeezed my shoulders.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m a terrible bore.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe <em>worst</em> bore.\\xa0 I have no idea why Fran likes you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe <em>likes</em> you.\\xa0 Like-like.\\xa0 The way she acted when we left them behind, I\\u2019m sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Now it was Jamie\\u2019s turn to look a little bit annoyed and concerned.\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 For all he wanted to mock me about wringing my hands over Mary, I knew he\\u2019d worry over this.\\xa0 He\\u2019d do the worrying for Fran, I knew, and it wasn\\u2019t necessarily a <em>bad</em> sort of worrying, but I felt a little thrill of victory.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe really likes me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe thinks boring old Jamie is the <em>best</em>.\\xa0 Let me tell you, if any girl liked me as much as she likes you\\u2026\\u201d I trailed off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI dunno!\\xa0 I could make them do <em>anything</em>.\\xa0 Color their hair blue, or spit in Dog\\u2019s face, or-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnything,\\u201d Jamie said, cutting me off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said, smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s one worry off my mind, at least,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was thinking about you and Mary, and the interplay between the two of you,\\u201d Jamie said, stumbling a bit as he tried to explain.\\xa0 \\u201c\\u2026few years too early for that, I suppose.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s <em>that</em> supposed to mean?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou pick things up quickly,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cObviously.\\xa0 And you picked up human interaction first.\\xa0 Your word choice, how you express yourself, is sometimes very adult, because of how you used it to craft your persona.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh\\u2026\\u201d I said, inviting him to go on.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a relief to see past that and get a glimpse at the you beneath all of it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a <em>but</em><em>t</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat is the real me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot maybe.\\xa0 You\\u2019re <em>definitely</em> a butt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI meant-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat you\\u2019re a butt?\\xa0 You butt?\\u201d\\xa0 I took advantage of how slow he could be to get up to speed, needling him.</p>\\n<p>He shifted his grip on my shoulders to catch my neck in the crook of his arm, lightly choking me.</p>\\n<p>I jabbed him in the soft side of his belly, which only made him choke me harder.</p>\\n<p>Our roughhousing carried on until we caught sight of Mrs. Earles, standing at the corner of the road.</p>\\n<p>From her reaction, it looked like she\\u2019d been looking for us.\\xa0 Jamie\\xa0 let go of my neck and the back of my underwear.\\xa0 I released him, too, and fixed my clothes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere are the others?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe a minute behind,\\u201d I said, looking back to check.\\xa0 \\u201cWe needed to talk a bit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo it seems,\\u201d she said, before reaching down to fix Jamie\\u2019s collar.\\xa0 \\u201cSomething\\u2019s come up?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary?\\u201d I asked, without missing a beat.\\xa0 \\u201cDid something happen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Mary just arrived with her bags.\\xa0 But she came with company.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>The puppeteer?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Too soon.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cMr. Hayle?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 Without missing a breath, I added, \\u201cDid he want something?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes to both questions,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She was distracted, craning her neck to see if she could spot the others.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Professor</em> Hayle asked you to meet him at the old stable?\\xa0 Do you know where that is?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood, because I don\\u2019t.\\xa0 If you want to go ahead, I can point the others your way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll wait,\\u201d I said, at the same time as Jamie\\u2019s, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll wait,\\u201d I reaffirmed.\\xa0 Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>It did take less than a minute for the others to catch up.\\xa0 When they came into sight, the smallest children picked up speed, stampeding toward Mrs. Earles.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t bend down to greet them, but reached out to touch a head here and there.</p>\\n<p>When Gordon and Helen saw us, I pointed down the side street to our right.\\xa0 Gordon nodded.</p>\\n<p>It took Helen some work to peel away from the children that had clustered around her.\\xa0 Not the <em>youngest</em>, the four to six year olds didn\\u2019t take to Helen as much, but the girls who were closer to my age, just a step below hers, they tended to idolize her.</p>\\n<p>While she said goodbyes and gently cut them short as they tried to question her, I had a thought.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian is with Mary,\\u201d Mrs. Earles said.</p>\\n<p>That bothered me.\\xa0 It was hard to put my finger on why.</p>\\n<p>I glanced back at Rick, who was looking at our contingent with a curious look in his eye.\\xa0 He started to follow, but Mrs. Earles served to run interference, ordering him to help her with the children.</p>\\n<p>I took too much joy in that.</p>\\n<p>Helen finally caught up, turning her back to everyone but our little group, her expression going flat.</p>\\n<p>We walked down the side street together.\\xa0 Toward the old stable, which hadn\\u2019t held any proper horses for a long time.\\xa0 It was a minor landmark, and it was too much of one to be knocked down, too ramshackle to see any use.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told Rick to back off,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe won\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI figured.\\xa0 But I thought I\\u2019d try.\\xa0 Wish I could do more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me that you agree he\\u2019s bent in the head.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s bent in the head,\\u201d Gordon agreed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you!\\u201d I said, pointing, looking at Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201cSee?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie stammered, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not- No.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t say he wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 I said it\\u2019s not-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s the smarmy, too-nice, wear Sy\\u2019s entrails as a belt sort of bent,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI, uh, no.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust you wait.\\xa0 If Mrs. Earles catches him licking the bathroom floor again, then-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAgain?\\u201d Jamie cut in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSee?\\xa0 Right there.\\xa0 First place your mind goes isn\\u2019t \\u2018he wouldn\\u2019t do that\\u2019.\\xa0 You\\u2019re fixating on the \\u2018again\\u2019 part!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said, very calmly, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s fine to fixate on the \\u2018again\\u2019 part of it.\\xa0 I think you\\u2019re a little over the top on that one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust you wait,\\u201d I warned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll wait,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t kill him in the meantime.\\xa0 It\\u2019s probably undeserved and it\\u2019ll upset Professor Hayle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd not the kind of upset that he usually lets you get away with,\\u201d Jamie pointed out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know, I know!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The trip to the stables didn\\u2019t take too long.\\xa0 The rain gradually increased in intensity, then settled to a light drizzle.\\xa0 I welcomed it, pushing my hair back.\\xa0 Jamie had his hood down too now that it was only drizzling, his long hair damp but not <em>wet</em>.\\xa0 His glasses were speckled with droplets he wasn\\u2019t wiping away.</p>\\n<p>When we arrived, I caught sight of Mary.\\xa0 Lillian was a short distance away.\\xa0 Hayle stood by the door of the stables, with Dog and Catcher nearby.\\xa0 I spotted the Gorger in the stables, sitting on the floor, his forehead as high as the stable door.</p>\\n<p>Mary looked a little out of her depth, but she was centered enough that she wasn\\u2019t letting it show.\\xa0 I had to infer not from expression or body language, but by the distance between her and Lillian.\\xa0 I liked that they weren\\u2019t standing close together.</p>\\n<p>Mary was wearing regular clothes for the first time since I\\u2019d met her, no Mothmont uniform or patient\\u2019s gown, and she had her hair in ribbons, a different configuration than I\\u2019d seen at our first meeting.\\xa0 Her hair was longer, and hadn\\u2019t been cut, though it was braided at one side for neatness\\u2019 sake.</p>\\n<p>She acknowledged me with a small smile as I approached, Jamie trailing after me.</p>\\n<p>Hayle was wearing his black lab coat, a simple shirt and slacks beneath, a folded umbrella at his side.\\xa0 The overhanging roof above the stable door was shielding him from the rain.\\xa0 He was talking to Gorger, but his eyes were on us, looking us over, assessing us, his eyes flickering between Mary and me a few times, <em>measuring</em>, much as I\\u2019d measured her distance from everyone else.</p>\\n<p>As Jamie had speculated, I\\u2019d modeled much of what I knew and did after other people around me, and I supposed one of those people was Mr. Hayle.</p>\\n<p>Dog was lying down in mud, very possibly enjoying the cool muck and grime.\\xa0 His expression was always hard to read, as he didn\\u2019t have a proper mouth and the metal fixtures around his face stretched skin and pulled at muscle in ways that made it less intuitive.\\xa0 Metal shutters that were normally down around the jaw had been raised around the nose, I noted, covering the lower half of his face.\\xa0 More guarded?</p>\\n<p>Catcher was still, unmoving, hands in pockets, his mancatcher standing up so it leaned against his elbow.</p>\\n<p>And the Gorger\\u2026 well, the Gorger was the Gorger.\\xa0 Fat and naked, with skin that looked too thick, bugged-out eyes with too-small pupils that moved too slowly drifting lazily over each of us, small, too-puckered lips pursed.\\xa0 Hayle was talking to him, but he wasn\\u2019t reacting or giving any hint that he was even listening.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lambs,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s been a little while.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust a little while,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDoing okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s been worse, Sy,\\u201d he replied.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Helen had broken away from Jamie and me.\\xa0 Gordon went straight to Dog.\\xa0 Where a handshake would do for someone else, Gordon simply reached out to touch the side of Dog\\u2019s head, brushing some hair back and away from Dog\\u2019s eye.\\xa0 Something in Dog relaxed the slightest fraction, muscles all down his shoulders and backs easing where they\\u2019d been tense.</p>\\n<p>Lonely thing.</p>\\n<p>Helen, for her part, was walking more slowly, swaying a little with her hands clasped behind her back, her skirt swishing left and right with each set of steps.\\xa0 She came to a stop somewhere midway between Gordon and the rest of us, hands still clasped behind her.</p>\\n<p>The swaying was almost playful, which was very interesting unto itself.\\xa0 Helen didn\\u2019t have a very expressive personality, and any expression she did give was usually for someone else\\u2019s benefit.</p>\\n<p>That raised the question of just <em>who</em> Helen was acting for, here.\\xa0 I looked over everyone, human and experiment alike, and I couldn\\u2019t pin it down.</p>\\n<p>That made me think it was for her <em>own</em> benefit.\\xa0 A hint of the personality that Helen was crafting for herself?\\xa0 An experiment, to see how people she saw as important might react and validate?</p>\\n<p>She caught me studying her and smiled a little, and it was a <em>naught</em>y smile.</p>\\n<p>Because Jamie wasn\\u2019t the only one who knew me well enough to guess what I was thinking.\\xa0 Was it for <em>my</em> benefit?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s scary,\\u201d Mary murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>You\\u2019re</em> scary,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell\\u2026\\u201d Mary said, and from the sound of it, she didn\\u2019t have a particularly good retort.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s on your side,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhich makes her a <em>good</em> scary, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Mary said, not sounding convinced.</p>\\n<p>This very scene was very much Helen\\u2019s medium.\\xa0 It was very much <em>not</em> Mary\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>It made me feel a great deal more confident in having her join the group.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t lost her in the time that Hayle and Lil and all the other Academy people had been poking, prodding, and interrogating her.</p>\\n<p>I reached out with a hand, touching hers.</p>\\n<p>She clasped my hand, and the surprising <em>tightness</em> of the hold told me my read on her wasn\\u2019t wrong in the slightest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever this is about,\\u201d Gordon commented, \\u201cIt\\u2019s big.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hayle had just finished talking to Gorger.\\xa0 He turned to face us.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s\\u2026 potentially problematic.\\xa0 Other special projects are already working on it.\\xa0 I wanted to bring you up to speed and make sure you\\u2019re communicating effectively.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not a problem,\\u201d Gordon said, hand still on Dog\\u2019s temple.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be brief.\\xa0 This is an all-hands-on-deck situation.\\xa0 Something got loose in the Academy.\\xa0 A student project.\\xa0 Catcher suggested we reach out to you, simply to have more eyes on the scene.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf something got loose and <em>they</em> can\\u2019t catch it, what makes you think <em>we</em> can?\\u201d\\xa0 Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe lose nothing by putting ourselves out there to help, and refusing would look bad, when the Academy is this concerned,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt was a lose-lose, where standing down would make us look ineffectual, but they weren\\u2019t confident you wouldn\\u2019t get in the way.\\xa0 I made our case, and they agreed to let us participate in the hunt, with the proviso that I have you meet some of the other special projects, tell you to communicate, and stress, very carefully, very <em>emphatically, </em>that you are not to get in the way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We all nodded, Mary included.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t nod, Sylvester,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m directing this largely at you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t keep the smile off my face.\\xa0 \\u201cI- what?\\xa0 Why me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t dignify that with an answer.\\xa0 Instead, he pointed at Mary, \\u201cI agreed to your request to let her join.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve indulged you a great many times in the past several years.\\xa0 I\\u2019m asking you to cooperate here.\\xa0 Please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The smile slipped from my face.\\xa0 I felt Mary squeeze my hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI will,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cThe experiment can\\u2019t leave the bounds of the city.\\xa0 Gorger will be in the wooded outskirts, Dog and Catcher in the city.\\xa0 We\\u2019re operating under the assumption that it\\u2019s still somewhere in the Academy, and much of the focus is there.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll be there, and I\\u2019ve arranged for you to talk to the culprit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCulprit,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s an interesting word choice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s the right one,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis incident was a <em>deliberate</em> one, and it was carried out by a student, who wasn\\u2019t operating alone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs it\\u2026 them?\\u201d I asked, glancing at Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cThe group that Percy was working with?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re following up on some things, but probably not.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve heard others suggest it\\u2019s something else.\\xa0 Whatever the case, word is out about the escaped experiment, and it\\u2019s <em>spreading</em>.\\xa0 People are scared.\\xa0 A fast resolution is preferred.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I bit back a sigh and a smartass comment.\\xa0 He <em>had</em> to jinx it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re on it,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Go.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We moved.\\xa0 Gorger rising, heaving his massive bulk to a standing position.\\xa0 Dog and Catcher turned, moving off down a side street as a pair.\\xa0 The remainder of us, the Lambs and our medic, headed in the direction of the Academy, Hayle following behind.</p>\\n<p>Mary didn\\u2019t let go of my hand the entire way to the Academy.</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/05/02/cat-out-of-the-bag-2-7/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI will be with you shortly,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cCecil, if you\\u2019d wait a moment?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d was the answer.\\xa0 Cecil, then, was the doctor who had entered the faculty room to deliver the news about the false escapes.</p>\\n<p>That said, our supervisor shut the door to the faculty room with more firmness than it deserved.\\xa0 Where Claret Hall had been grown, the windows and doors had been put in by ordinary means, and the door chosen for this particular room was big and solid enough that it could have shattered any arm caught in between it and the frame.</p>\\n<p>It made a good slam.\\xa0 Hayle was not happy with me.</p>\\n<p>Our group stood out in the hallway, some of us shuffling our feet.\\xa0 The doctor that stood off to one side was looking at us with curiosity, but didn\\u2019t venture to say anything.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat could have gone worse,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>There was no response.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProfessor Briggs was in an uncharacteristically good mood,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The awkward silence lingered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to get<em> badges</em>,\\u201d I said, because things were reaching the point where annoyance or anger would have been preferable to the non-answers.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t get annoyance or anger.</p>\\n<p>Silence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe waste so much damn time on stuff we shouldn\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt was a chance to stop doing that.\\xa0 Step up our game.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at each of them in turn.\\xa0 Gordon was giving me a level stare, Helen seemed more preoccupied with fixing scuffed nails, and both Jamie and Lillian were avoiding my eyes.\\xa0 Mary looked a little confused.</p>\\n<p>This was an egg I could crack.\\xa0 Mary was the most obvious go-to, but I felt like going that way would stack the deck against me.\\xa0 The others would see through what I was trying to do, in part because it would be as transparent as all get out, and then they\\u2019d side against me.\\xa0 Me and maybe Mary against the four of them.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d lose any points I\\u2019d won with Mary if I put her in that situation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou <em>know </em>the badges make sense.\\xa0 I know that you have to go through a lot of checkpoints to see Professor Ibbot, depending on where he\\u2019s working at a given point in time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do,\\u201d she said, looking up from her nails.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t engage him,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll do what I want, thank you very much,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 Prim and proper of tone, and fully capable of using that tone as a weapon on its own.\\xa0 She turned her gaze to me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou forget that in dealing with Professor Ibbot, I have to deal with very capricious personalities.\\xa0 I know what it means to deal with powerful people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>You mean you have to deal with his personality</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t forget,\\u201d I said, sullenly.\\xa0 \\u201cI was trying to downplay that part of things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t worry,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cProfessor Hayle is more reasonable than most.\\xa0 He can\\u2019t blame you too much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToo much,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan I ask?\\u201d Mary cut in.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy is everyone acting like Sy is going to die or something?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Thank you for forcing some discourse</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can ask, but we\\u2019ve got company,\\u201d Gordon said, indicating the man that Hayle had called Cecil.\\xa0 \\u201cIt would be unwise to go into details.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Damn you for shutting down said discourse</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Excuse</em> me?\\u201d the man asked, archly.\\xa0 Teacher, doctor, gray coat, whatever we called him, he\\u2019d grown accustomed to a general degree of respect.\\xa0 Being shut out of a discussion between children was a few rungs below where he was used to being.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeg pardon.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve been asked to keep silent on certain subjects while we do errands for the faculty, sir,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He feigned a lack of confidence.\\xa0 \\u201cIf that\\u2019s okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 He digested that nugget, which wasn\\u2019t a hard thing to do.\\xa0 The hierarchy was reinforced.\\xa0 Professors had more say than doctors, who had more say than we did.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s alright.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave him a grateful smile.</p>\\n<p>More how Gordon operated, really.\\xa0 My <em>modus operandi</em> was to put people off balance, see where they were most vulnerable, and push to topple them.\\xa0 Gordon was almost doing the opposite here.\\xa0 Reaffirming the rules and the social order.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know,\\u201d I told Gordon, \\u201cIf we-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would <em>strongly</em> urge you to think about what you\\u2019re going to say to Professor Hayle, after he comes back out,\\u201d Gordon said, cutting me off.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not mad.\\xa0 I\\u2019m worried about you.\\xa0 And if you goof this up bad enough <em>we</em> suffer for it, I <em>will</em> be mad.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Doctor Cecil spoke up, speaking in a slightly patronizing tone, \\u201cWhatever you\\u2019re doing here, if you\\u2019ve got connections to the guys in that room, it\\u2019s a gig I\\u2019d recommend you hold on to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExactly,\\u201d Gordon said, playing along.\\xa0 \\u201cI like this gig, Sy.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t lose us this gig.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat happens if we lose this gig?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat is a very good question,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne you\\u2019re not going to answer?\\u201d\\xa0 Mary asked, glancing at the Doctor, who made a face at the glance\\u2019s implication.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot because of any secrets,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI really don\\u2019t know what happens.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think you\\u2019re being paranoid,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re not going to toss us out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think,\\u201d Gordon said, very carefully, \\u201cthat out of the two of us, I\\u2019m the one who has faint memories of your predecessors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ashton and Evette.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt suggests that you really should stop arguing with me and plan how you\\u2019re going to get back on Professor Hayle\\u2019s good side.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt suggests nothing of the sort!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d I said, without missing a beat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRemember when I said I wasn\\u2019t angry?\\xa0 You\\u2019re changing my mind.\\xa0 Please don\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed, crossed the hallway, and leaned against the wall opposite the others.\\xa0 I fished in my pocket for a small folding knife, more for cutting twine and carving sticks than for opening people up.\\xa0 I unfolded it, and tossed it in the air.\\xa0 I caught it by the flat of the blade, between thumb and index finger, made it bounce as I tested the weight, then flipped it over again, catching it by the blade again.</p>\\n<p>I always focused my thoughts best when I had something to occupy the rest of my attention.</p>\\n<p>The door opened too quickly after that.\\xa0 Hayle stepped out, then shut the door behind him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis way, please,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cCecil, too, if you could?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can, sir,\\u201d Cecil said.</p>\\n<p>We followed our gray-haired Professor and father figure a little ways down the hallway.\\xa0 Hayle stopped by the window, glancing out at the city beyond.</p>\\n<p>He let us wallow in the silence.\\xa0 Even I wasn\\u2019t reckless enough to break the silence and test him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCecil, I\\u2019ve been told you don\\u2019t have any pressing obligations?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI, uh, do not, no.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll be one of two individuals to go with them.\\xa0 Do what they require of you, <em>within reason, </em>facilitate them, and don\\u2019t ask too many questions.\\xa0 Do this for us and a recently vacated laboratory in the underground area will be yours, along with some leeway to pursue any personal projects.\\xa0 <em>Some</em> leeway, I hope you understand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI understand I shouldn\\u2019t waste academy funds,\\u201d Cecil said, \\u201cBut if something has my fancy and I can justify it, that would be alright?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou understand, I think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA friend of mine is more passionate about his project than I am about any of mine.\\xa0 If I brought him in-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be fine,\\u201d Hayle said, curt.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t mind?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Cecil raised his hands, \\u201cBy all means.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Hayle said, and he said it in a way that made me shrink a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood response, that,\\u201d he said, in a tone that betrayed some anger.\\xa0 \\u201cKeep it up.\\xa0 Cecil, I\\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\\u2019t repeat any of what I\\u2019m about to say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m already in your debt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Hayle said, again, driving the point in.\\xa0 \\u201cAs cunning as you think you are, with carefully laid schemes and nonsense, the rest of us <em>do</em> entertain our own ideas and plans.\\xa0 Me among them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, mute.\\xa0 I\\u2019d only seen him like this once or twice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have been anticipating and waiting a rather long time for a situation like this to crop up.\\xa0 One where, whether they like it or not, they depend on <em>my</em> resources.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The look he gave us made it very clear that we were among those resources.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI knew, right away, that I would have some leeway, with the ability to call in favors and ask for resources.\\xa0 All the more so if I can <em>resolve</em> this problem.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cImagine my frustration when the situation happens to unfold <em>just</em> as I want it to, and an impertinent little boy steps forward and makes his own bid for favor, asking for resources, because he thought it would be <em>funny.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought it would be <em>useful,</em>\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe waste so much damn time on stuff we shouldn\\u2019t, getting past patrols and bureaucracy, maintaining the ruse.\\xa0 It was a chance to free ourselves to act faster and more efficiently.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was the same argument I\\u2019d posed to my friends.</p>\\n<p>Had all gone well, if they\\u2019d been more willing to play ball and <em>argue</em> with me, maybe I could have felt more prepared posing the same defense to Professor Hayle.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d he said, and it didn\\u2019t sound like a concession or agreement at all.\\xa0 \\u201cIf that was the case, you could have come to me with it.\\xa0 I would have been able to make it part of a <em>number</em> of concessions I asked for, from our esteemed Professor Briggs.\\xa0 As it stands, I\\u2019m not entirely certain he wouldn\\u2019t tell me no; that he\\u2019s assisting <em>you</em> and that my project should stand on its own merit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart sank.\\xa0 \\u201cYes sir.\\xa0 What were you going to-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpeak less, Sylvester, nod and agree with me more, please.\\xa0 For both of our sakes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReverend Mauer is attacking the reputation of the Academy.\\xa0 As much as we\\u2019d like to be entirely self sustaining, we depend on Radham at large for certain resources.\\xa0 As much as I hate to admit it, Briggs is very likely <em>correct</em> in suggesting we could solve this with brute force, but it <em>would</em> be messy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 The others were nodding as well.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told you just this afternoon that I wanted you to <em>impress</em>, no shenanigans, no jokes or off the wall behavior.\\xa0 As it stands, your saving grace would be to see this through, executing it perfectly enough to impress me, impress Head Professor Briggs, and even impress Professors Sexton, Reid, and Fletcher, who were quick to make jokes at my expense, as soon as you left the room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExecuted perfectly,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Perfectly</em>,\\u201d Hayle said, in a deliberate way that suggested he thought that a careful enough pronunciation could get it through my skull.\\xa0 \\u201cI know what you\\u2019re capable of.\\xa0 Impress me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI will,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou asked for an adult, Cecil is one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf two, sir?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf two.\\xa0 When I was put on point and forced to think of students who I could trust to look after you all, those I knew, who had no other obligations\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLacey,\\u201d I almost groaned the word.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLacey, yes.\\xa0 She won\\u2019t be happy, but I believe she will make herself available for the evening.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCecil,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cMiss Lacey will catch up with you shortly.\\xa0 I told you to do what these boys and girls said, within <em>reason.\\xa0 </em>I hope you can rely on Lacey to define what is actually <em>reasonable</em>, should you find yourself wondering.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t help but feel as if I\\u2019m missing something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat feeling will get a great deal more pointed before you\\u2019re done with this task.\\xa0 Ignore it, push it to the back of your mind, and focus on the much-coveted lab you\\u2019ll have all to yourself when all of this is over.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Cecil nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to the church?\\u201d Hayle asked.</p>\\n<p>I glanced at the others, then nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLacey will catch up with you in my coach.\\xa0 Do not try to evade her or make it hard for her to find you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNoted,\\u201d Gordon said, putting a hand on my shoulder.</p>\\n<p>Apparently I had suffered enough in Hayle\\u2019s sights.\\xa0 Gordon was backing me up, even if it was only a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWatch him,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe will,\\u201d Gordon replied.</p>\\n<p>The latent anger and frustration was clear in Hayle\\u2019s body language as he headed back to the faculty room.</p>\\n<p>When the door shut behind him, not quite as loud as it had been earlier, we remained silent for several long moments.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t worry,\\u201d Doctor Cecil said, very gently.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not nearly as scary as Professor Hayle, there.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know if it helps to win you over, but I plan to be far kinder to the common people when I become a professor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think that makes you one of our new favorites,\\u201d Gordon said, and the condescending lie was so transparent I was <em>certain</em> Cecil would see through it.</p>\\n<p>But Cecil only wallowed in his self indulgence, smiling, and placed a hand on Gordon\\u2019s head, then mine, leading us on our way.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The rain and moisture that the summer heat had held off was returning now that it was cooler, Radham paying us back in spades for the warmth we\\u2019d enjoyed earlier in the day.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The sunset was in full sway, and the light filtered through clouds in veins of purple and red.\\xa0 The clouds themselves were thick enough to be almost black.\\xa0 On the ground, lamps were bright, but the dull yellow glow was meager compared to the puddles and the moisture running down the branches and wood on walls, where the light from above was reflected, bringing the surfaces to life.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The black coach rolled up.\\xa0 Two stitched guards were perched on top, both clad in heavy raincoats.\\xa0 The only openings in their coats were the slots that had been left for their milky white eyes, and even those slots were protected from rain by cap-like brims in the raincoat hoods.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The rain was warm, but the stitched were warmer.\\xa0 Horse and man alike were virtually <em>steaming</em>, the moisture rising off their heads, shoulders and backs in clouds.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The coach door opened, and an umbrella unfurled.\\xa0 In the midst of stark blacks and reds, Lacey\\u2019s red hair caught light and looked absolutely brilliant.\\xa0 Well matched to our Cecil\\u2019s neat black hair, which was cut a little too close to the head at the backs and sides, a little too coy in how the parted hair curled at the brow.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There were jokes about whether a Professor was left mentally off-kilter by the lengthy and torturous process of getting licensed as such, or whether only the mentally cracked were inclined to pursue that path.\\xa0 Well, being a teacher or a doctor was a step down that road.\\xa0 Cecil being a little eccentric was entirely to be expected.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And Lacey, who I\\u2019d left on bad terms, was staring at us, lips pressed together in something approximating irritation.\\xa0 She looked very human and very grounded, standing out in her white coat.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She reached into one pocket, and withdrew a small envelope.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I reached out to take it, but Gordon beat me to the punch, giving me a look.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Our temporary badge.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cLose the coat,\\u201d I told Lacey.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lacey didn\\u2019t immediately obey.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe were talking about it while we waited for you.\\xa0 We\\u2019re going undercover, in a sense,\\u201d Gordon explained.\\xa0 \\u201cThe people we\\u2019re dealing with are very upset with the Academy.\\xa0 Wearing a coat would be counterproductive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cVery well,\\u201d Lacey said.\\xa0 She handed her umbrella to a stitched, who held the umbrella in place while she doffed her white lab coat and placed it inside the coach.\\xa0 \\u201cAnything else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe less attention we attract, the better,\\u201d Gordon continued to explain.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Reverend is gathering soldiers.\\xa0 He put out an offer in a very subtle way, telling people that if they were angry, they could come to him.\\xa0 Then, in a very coincidental bit of timing, he spread the word that three more experiments had escaped.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOnly one of which was true,\\u201d Lacey said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYes,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cLarge and visible enough to get attention, and give life to the fears that people have about the other two.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe need to get close,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s gathering people around him, ready for the war that Briggs was prepared to give him.\\xa0 If we confronted him, we\\u2019d be up against everything he had arrayed and positioned against us.\\xa0 If we go with the flow, and successfully join the influx of people that are heading his way\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cA brilliant little idea,\\u201d Cecil informed me, in a tone so patronizing it made my teeth hurt.\\xa0 \\u201cBut, again, you refuse to admit the very real fact that you\\u2019re <em>children</em>.\\xa0 Hardly a good choice for an army.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd you\\u2019re adults,\\u201d I said, not for the first time.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to <em>try</em> it.\\xa0 If it doesn\\u2019t work, we\\u2019ll adapt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt seems convoluted.\\xa0 What if this attractive young lady and I were to go alone?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>I think you\\u2019d cock it up</em>, I thought.\\xa0 I tried to figure out a way to phrase it nicely.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI think you\\u2019d cock it up,\\u201d I told him, when I couldn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">His mouth dropped open.\\xa0 I saw a flicker of genuine anger in his expression.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSir,\\u201d Gordon cut in, giving me a dark look.\\xa0 \\u201cProfessor Hayle told you to do as we asked?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Cecil shut his mouth.\\xa0 He took a second before admitting, \\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cPlease do this, sir.\\xa0 Hayle asked for it for a reason.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Cecil composed himself.\\xa0 He looked very unhappy compared to where he\\u2019d been at the moment of Lacey\\u2019s arrival.\\xa0 His words were painfully stiff as he asked, \\u201cIs there anything else you\\u2019d like me to do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was Helen who jumped to the rescue.\\xa0 \\u201cWould you please escort Miss Lacey?\\xa0 I think Gordon needs to give Sylvester a talking to, and he can\\u2019t do it while you\\u2019re here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As unhappy as Lacey had seemed, her expression grew darker at that request.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Doctor Cecil, for his part, <em>beamed</em>.\\xa0 He offered Lacey his arm.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">While he wasn\\u2019t looking, Helen, followed soon after by Lillian, Jamie, Mary, Gordon, and myself, in roughly that order, clasped her hands together in a pleading gesture.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lacey took up Cecil\\u2019s arm.\\xa0 Together, they walked about ten paces ahead of us.\\xa0 We started after them, maintaining the distance.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Well done, Helen</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou think we\\u2019ll have the means to get in?\\u201d Gordon asked me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI think so.\\xa0 Whatever Cecil thinks\\u2026 I suspect the Reverend is trying to win over the community.\\u201d\\xa0 I gestured at Cecil and Lacey.\\xa0 \\u201cMan, woman\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd child,\\u201d Mary finished.\\xa0 I flashed her a smile, grateful for the line.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cRecruiting children is reprehensible on its own.\\xa0 Recruiting a <em>family</em>?\\xa0 Or recruiting a family man?\\xa0 A caretaker with his kids in tow?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI believe it,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s still a chance we won\\u2019t get in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019ll get in,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf he\\u2019s plotting something specific, and children don\\u2019t fit into the plan?\\u201d\\xa0 Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI <em>just</em> got things arranged so we don\\u2019t have to get stalled and stonewalled by random Academy bureaucracy and security,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell me I\\u2019ve got to push every last thing past you guys and your twenty questions.\\xa0 You trust me, or you\\u2019re <em>supposed</em> to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cTrusted.\\xa0 Past tense,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cForgive us if we\\u2019re just a little bit cautious, after you made an enemy of Hayle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cFine,\\u201d I sighed.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat was the question, again?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat if he\\u2019s got something in mind?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cSomething we can\\u2019t finagle our way into?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019ll deal.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t anticipate all that.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s assume this will work.\\xa0 We each know what we do and how we operate.\\xa0 Any questions?\\xa0 Coordination?\\xa0 Ideas?\\xa0 Or do you want to wing it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Our boots splashed more violently through a deceptive puddle, which filled a dip in the road.\\xa0 I felt water find its way to the bottom of my rain boot.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI know how <em>I</em> work,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou said we can\\u2019t kill the Shepherd.\\xa0 Can I do something else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWait a second, repeat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCan I do something else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBefore that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe Shepherd?\\u201d\\xa0 Mary asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was dark, but not so dark that I didn\\u2019t see the small smile on her face.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I groaned.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWell played,\\u201d Gordon murmured.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s smile grew wider</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe Shepherd and the Lambs,\\u201d Jamie remarked.\\xa0 \\u201cI like it.\\xa0 We know the name of our enemy, now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary looked entirely too pleased with herself, working it in as casually as she had.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I couldn\\u2019t even bring myself to dislike it, because it was <em>Mary</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cTo answer your question,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy gut feeling is that slowing the man down could do us a <em>world</em> of good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHe\\u2019s planned his moves out in advance,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cTiming things, the note that Wally had, giving him a specific time to release his experiment.\\xa0 The spread of the story about the <em>three</em> escaped experiments was timed to coincide with the actual release of the one.\\xa0 Yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSlowing down,\\u201d Lillian murmured.\\xa0 She moved her bag around in front of her, and rummaged inside.\\xa0 \\u201cUm, side effects, ratios, um, um, um\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDiarrhea?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t have anything fast.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cImpaired judgment?\\xa0 Nothing so obvious he\\u2019d immediately think he\\u2019d been poisoned, but something to make him more likely to make mistakes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo side effects like that.\\xa0 Headache?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary extended a hand.\\xa0 Lillian passed over a short glass vial with something inside.\\xa0 A powder.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cFor a man his size, I\\u2019d guess a teaspoon,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr you could ask Cecil or Lacey, they\\u2019ll know the ratio off the top of their head.\\xa0 If you give me a second, I have a measure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s fine,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s fine?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf it\\u2019s just a teaspoon, I can eyeball it, nine out of ten times,\\u201d Mary said, holding up her hand so one finger was extended.\\xa0 She tapped her long fingernail with the little vial.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Cut to a very specific length.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat happens the other time?\\u201d Jamie asked, quiet.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019ll err on the side of giving too little,\\u201d Mary said, with confidence.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGood,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSy?\\xa0 What are you thinking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m thinking\\u2026 our Shepherd is playing a game of chess.\\xa0 We\\u2019re late to the game.\\xa0 Every piece of his is well positioned.\\xa0 All so he\\u2019s untouchable.\\xa0 We\\u2019d be a lot better off if they hadn\\u2019t waited before asking us to jump in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCan\\u2019t cry over spilled milk,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo.\\xa0 That\\u2019s true.\\xa0 But haven\\u2019t you ever been sitting at a chess board, thinking to yourself just how nice it would be if you could just take his turn for him?\\xa0 Make the worst possible play, then watch them scramble to try to recover?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cNever crossed my mind.\\xa0 I have wanted to swat you across the head when I realize you\\u2019ve cheated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have an idea, Sylvester?\\u201d Jamie asked, before Gordon and I could get in an argument.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do.\\xa0 I just need to figure out an angle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStart figuring,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause we\\u2019re here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The church was busy, brighter than any building in Radham, short of the Academy.\\xa0 Even at the darker periphery, where bright lights didn\\u2019t quite reach far enough past the windows and through the rain, there were lanterns and glowing cigarette ends.</p>\\n<p>We approached, picking up the pace to draw closer to our guardians.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m your\\u2026?\\u201d Lacey asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOlder sister,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The look she gave me told me my attempt to curry favor hadn\\u2019t quite worked.\\xa0 She saw right through me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd I\\u2019m?\\u201d Cecil asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTeacher.\\xa0 Not\\xa0an Academy teacher, but a regular one.\\xa0 Parents left us in your care.\\xa0 If Lacey doesn\\u2019t want to be an older sister, she can be a colleague.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see,\\u201d Cecil said.\\xa0 \\u201cI can play along.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I dearly hope so</em>, I thought, turning my mind toward options to speak up or cut him off.\\xa0 Kicking him in the back of the knee would have to do in a pinch, if he was a particularly bad actor.</p>\\n<p>As it turned out, it wasn\\u2019t so necessary.</p>\\n<p>The door was open, and people were waiting as we approached.\\xa0 Being with Cecil and Lacey made the entrance painless.\\xa0 Nobody spoke up or stood in our way, as we joined a crowd that was now gathered within the building.</p>\\n<p>Where fear had ruled, earlier in the day, there was anger now.\\xa0 Restlessness.\\xa0 Too many people wanting to <em>do</em> something, yet finding themselves unable.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd had been at work, tending to his flock.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd was right <em>there</em>, ready to greet all newcomers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWelcome,\\u201d he said, and his smile was warm.\\xa0 He extended his good hand to us, his other arm limp at his side.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I see I recognize one of you.\\xa0 Mary Cobourn?\\xa0 It\\u2019s been a few years.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>A plan never survives contact with the enemy</em>.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t see a break in her facade, and her smile was natural, but safe behind Lacey and Cecil, her hand found mine, clutching it with a tightness that suggested alarm.</p>\\n<p>Our little clone didn\\u2019t remember this part of Mary\\u2019s history.</p>\\n<p>Which threw a fair sized wrench into our machinations.</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/cat-out-of-the-bag-2-8/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood evening, reverend,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd smiled, for perhaps the first time since I\\u2019d seen him.\\xa0 It was disconcerting, especially considering our somewhat precarious situation.\\xa0 Smiles meant things, and a <em>rare</em> smile boded ill.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome in, please.\\xa0 I\\u2019m glad to see you, Mary, you\\u2019ve been on my thoughts in recent months.\\xa0 Are these your\\u2026?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFriends,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p><em>Good, keep it simple</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you are?\\u201d the man asked, directing his attention to Lacey and Cecil.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTeachers,\\u201d Lacey said, following Mary\\u2019s lead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI had a great many conversations with your father, Mary, and your education was one of the topics.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe didn\\u2019t tell me about that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe wouldn\\u2019t, I don\\u2019t think,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s not the image I have of him.\\xa0 You spent quite some time here when you were small.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did, but my memory of then isn\\u2019t so good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\xa0 I would have thought otherwise.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2026 daydreamed, mostly.\\xa0 When I think to back then, I think of the games I played in my head.\\xa0 The church seems smaller than it was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, I can\\u2019t help but take a small amount of offense at that,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe put some work into expanding it.\\xa0 It was quite a trial, even.\\xa0 The men I answer to tend to think a church in Radham a lost cause.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wanted so badly to help her, but I couldn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>Jamie must have felt even worse in that regard.\\xa0 Jamie probably knew what the remodel had been, and the actual year and seasons it had taken place.</p>\\n<p>Mary defaulted to silence.\\xa0 A terrible, awkward, damning silence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA small amount of offense,\\u201d the Shepherd said, offering her a smile.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re not so different from your father.\\xa0 Will you join me for a conversation?\\xa0 With your chaperone and friends, of course?\\xa0 Things are fairly quiet right now, and I\\u2019m hoping a few more people arrive or come back inside before I give Mr. Gill the stage to address everyone and quiet their fears.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI, um,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I gave her hand a squeeze.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat could be nice?\\u201d she ventured.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cCome, then.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll have some tea and a bite to eat, if your teachers are fine with that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Cecil said, a little too quickly.\\xa0 Then, as if to compensate, \\u201cthat would be fine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd smiled at that, as if enjoying a private joke.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll show you the way, then.\\xa0 It\\u2019s foul out there, in more ways than one, and creature comforts go a long way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We were lead down the aisle, through an open set of double doors at one side of the church.\\xa0 To look at it, going by the coat by the door and the sets of shoes, Mauer lived in the building, and this intermediate area between the area that was open to the public and the living area was something of an office.</p>\\n<p>It was a more private place to meet people, from what I gathered.\\xa0 There was even a door leading from the little office to the outside, so people could come and meet him here directly.\\xa0 I noted the presence of little stones at the base of the door, too small to be the type to hold it open.\\xa0 Not that people tended to leave doors open in rainy Radham.</p>\\n<p>Not solely a place of business, the space felt a touch too staged to be a proper part of his home, either.\\xa0 A dark red military jacket, trimmed in gold cord, sat behind glass, within a fair sized frame.\\xa0 A smaller frame of the same make held three badges and an emblem from his old military company.\\xa0 They were here for the sake of others, not for Mauer, I suspected.\\xa0 The way the cabinet to Mauer\\u2019s left was laid out, he didn\\u2019t have a good view of either.\\xa0 We, finding seats in chairs and benches on the far side of his desk, had a clear view of both.</p>\\n<p>There were other things and keepsakes too, better placed for Mauer to see.\\xa0 Photos of him with family as a child, when he was about our age, black, white, and blurry.\\xa0 A professionally taken, expanded photo of a relative wearing a baseball jersey, mid-pitch.\\xa0 A cross, however, took center stage behind his chair.\\xa0 Worn, beaten and battered, with chips of paint missing, revealing pale, old wood beneath.</p>\\n<p>It was a stark contrast to this very put-together man with his bronze-red hair so neat, yet I fully, one-hundred percent believed that the cross was <em>his</em>, not the church\\u2019s.\\xa0 A family keepsake, perhaps.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d just finished filling his kettle with water from a pitcher, and had turned a little heated plate on.\\xa0 Half-turning, he\\u2019d caught me looking at the cross.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m guessing you\\u2019re not one to attend church,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMost don\\u2019t, do they?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cEspecially people our age?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Not in Radham, at least until <em>bad things</em> start happening,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 He leaned a little to one side to look through the doors to the church proper, where the crowd was still getting sorted out, gathering in groups and talking in low tones.\\xa0 \\u201cAs we see tonight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u2018Bad things\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>To me, it sounded like a tepid way of referring to the escaped experiments, but to a real child of my age, coming from a man of authority, it could be reassuring in a way.\\xa0 Acknowledging and downplaying the problem.</p>\\n<p>I found myself wondering what process was at work behind his words.\\xa0 Did he tailor them to his audience with intent, thoughts flying to pick the best one for each situation, or did he do it naturally?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt sounds like you\\u2019re trying to guilt him into attending church more,\\u201d Cecil said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne of my jobs,\\u201d Mauer said, smiling at Cecil.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to forgive me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Cecil gave him a tight smile in response.</p>\\n<p>Awkward.\\xa0 Cecil was not the right man for this job.\\xa0 I should have been more specific.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d the Shepherd said, taking it in stride, \\u201cYour father and I had long debates about your attendance at Mothmont.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t see it as confidential, as many of the debates were in public forums, more as friends than as council.\\xa0 When he took up the accounting job for the mayor, he became too busy.\\xa0 I think I asked what became of you, but memory fails me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did go to Mothmont,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPast tense?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>He waved his hand.\\xa0 \\u201cTrust me, I\\u2019ve heard the word \\u2018sir\\u2019 enough for one lifetime.\\xa0 \\u2018Father\\u2019 works, but I\\u2019m not too fond of that either.\\xa0 When you said past-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAren\\u2019t titles and symbols important for a reverend?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 \\u201cOh, I\\u2019m sorry, Father, I didn\\u2019t mean to interrupt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was interesting, seeing how Mary\\u2019s mind worked when she was put on the spot.\\xa0 This wasn\\u2019t her focus or specialty.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t an actor, and for much of her relatively short existence, she\\u2019d been raised to emulate one role, possibly for one audience, her parents.</p>\\n<p>But Mary wasn\\u2019t foolish or stupid.\\xa0 Even the \\u2018sir\\u2019 could have been intentional, turning the discussion back on the Shepherd.\\xa0 Now she was putting the focus back on him.</p>\\n<p>Not the tactic I would have chosen, but it was a good tactic.\\xa0 Almost attacking him, in a sense, not letting him return a strike.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe symbols aren\\u2019t so important to me, not in that way,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 He looked very at ease as the kettle started whistling.\\xa0 He poured it into a waiting teapot and deposited some teabags.\\xa0 \\u201cI believe in simple and fundamental truths.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve seen people in my position try to give counsel to the suffering with fancy words and high concepts, with symbols and rituals.\\xa0 It felt hollow, and I told myself I wouldn\\u2019t do that to others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing, then?\\u201d Cecil asked.</p>\\n<p><em>Holy hell, Cecil, would you shut up?</em></p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t the words alone, but the tone that he\\u2019d given them.\\xa0 Accusatory.</p>\\n<p>It was Gordon that sprung to the rescue.\\xa0 \\u201cIs it okay if I don\\u2019t have tea and treats?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe either?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 A little too fast.\\xa0 Gordon might have prodded or signaled her, if I had to guess.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d Cecil said.\\xa0 \\u201cYes, I think it would be.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon sprung up from his seat, retreating, Lillian following right after.</p>\\n<p>I saw what he was doing and started to formulate a way to communicate it to Lacey when she spoke.\\xa0 \\u201cCharles.\\xa0 You should watch them and make sure they don\\u2019t get into trouble.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t see it, which meant the Shepherd couldn\\u2019t see it either, but it was very possible that Lacey had given Cecil a wink to drive the point home.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think I should.\\xa0 If you\\u2019ll excuse me,\\u201d Cecil said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry <em>father</em>, but I would love to have tea and a discussion another time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course,\\u201d the Reverend said.\\xa0 \\u201cThree less cups of tea, then?</p>\\n<p>He brought the teapot over to his desk, then retrieved cups from the cabinet.\\xa0 \\u201cPeople are scared.\\xa0 The rest of you are all right?\\xa0 Don\\u2019t feel obligated to stay for Mary\\u2019s sake.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m quite alright,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She offered him a winning smile.\\xa0 \\u201cTea would be lovely.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou just want the treats that he\\u2019s serving with the tea,\\u201d I teased her.</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s expression shifted, a touch of momentary outrage, suppressed, consternation, composure.</p>\\n<p>My statement was partially intended to augment Helen\\u2019s mask, and partially in hopes that I could maintain the distraction, draw things out further so that Cecil\\u2019s accusatory question could more easily be forgotten.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she admitted.\\xa0 Then, delayed, as if she\\u2019d just remembered, \\u201cPlease.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>All for the benefit of the Reverend.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFruit cake?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s smile widened.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>For a man that professed to have little interest in ritual, the tea was most definitely one.\\xa0 Serving tea to a group all the more so: asking what everyone wanted, portioning out the cake on little saucers with individual forks, and handing them out.</p>\\n<p>And in all of that, there were no clues as to how he\\u2019d grown so good at manipulating the masses.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going to happen?\\u201d I asked, before he\\u2019d finished portioning out the cake and gotten settled, ready to focus wholly on the discussion.\\xa0 Taking the initiative, much as Mary had fought to maintain it, just minutes ago.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think that depends wholly on the Academy,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 He turned the fancy little tea spoon from his tea over in his hands.\\xa0 \\u201cFour experiments got loose in the span of one day.\\xa0 I have to wonder how it even happened, if some safeguard failed.\\xa0 God willing, we\\u2019ll only need to stay safe until they\\u2019ve cleaned up their mess.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Can\\u2019t clean up experiments that only escaped in rumor</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat if it doesn\\u2019t stop?\\u201d I asked, but what I was really asking was, <em>what if you keep up these rumors?\\xa0 Stir people up into a frenzy?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen I suppose Mary will be counting on you to protect her,\\u201d the Shepherd said.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t left at a loss for words terribly often.\\xa0 The Shepherd had managed it.\\xa0 My mouth sat open.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI caught a glimpse of you two holding hands, seeing inside the crook of your teacher\\u2019s elbow,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 He finished doling out the saucers of cake, then took a seat, stirring his tea with a small, thin-handled spoon.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re asking these questions out of concern for her welfare?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI am,\\u201d I finally managed.\\xa0 My mind was racing.\\xa0 He\\u2019d noticed that detail.\\xa0 What else had he seen?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s your name?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSid,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to grow up to be a good man, Sid.\\xa0 Mary is lucky to have you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure how to respond to that, so I focused on my tea, instead.\\xa0 The saucer of cake sat in my lap, and I held the teacup with both hands, raising it to my mouth.</p>\\n<p>He might have taken it for embarrassment, but I was taking the time to think, free of further poking and prodding from our Shepherd.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t missing the fact that I was <em>losing</em> in this verbal battle, and I wasn\\u2019t positive our man was even <em>playing</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe got off track earlier,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat led you to leave Mothmont, Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere was an incident.\\xa0 Children got sick, the school was closed.\\xa0 I talked to my parents, and they thought I would be safer elsewhere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith your lovely teacher here.\\xa0 Miss?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLindsey,\\u201d Lacey said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you teaching the students in hopes that they will attend the Academy, then?\\u201d the Shepherd asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI- no.\\xa0 They\\u2019re free to make that choice, but that\\u2019s not our goal.\\xa0 After the incident at Mothmont, we\\u2019re even downplaying it, for the parents\\u2019 benefit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd nodded, but he had a concerned look on his face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that wrong?\\u201d Lacey asked.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd sipped at his tea, then put his cup down.\\xa0 No response was forthcoming.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFather?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He let out a sigh.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen I was small, younger than these children are now, my father was a soldier.\\xa0 He served in <em>the</em> American War.\\xa0 The young men were all told how important the war was.\\xa0 They were given all sorts of reasons.\\xa0 Patriotism, principle, <em>faith</em>.\\xa0 Their value as men was entirely dependent on how willing they were to die for their country.\\xa0 How others valued them, and how they valued themselves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy father was too young to participate, but he remembered what it was like,\\u201d Lacey said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn one side, men, shooting, dying, panicking.\\xa0 On the other side, rank and file of stitched soldier.\\xa0 Utterly obedient, each capable of getting up after being shot, needing only quick repair work before they were ready to see the field again.\\xa0 Two or three times as strong as any soldier on my father\\u2019s side.\\xa0 They had weaknesses, yes, but they had more strengths.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He seemed to realize who he was talking to, and frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, I had a train of thought, and was musing aloud.\\xa0 Am I scaring the children?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head, joining Jamie, Helen, and Mary.\\xa0 Jamie ventured, \\u201cIt\\u2019s interesting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought of my father, then myself, and looking at the younger generation, hearing how their education progresses, it got me thinking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to hear,\\u201d I said, with the blithe eagerness that only a child could get away with.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmm.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll leave out details.\\xa0 The Crown won, as they win virtually every war.\\xa0 America lost.\\xa0 I reached the age my father had been when he\\u2019d been convinced to go to war, but no reasons were given when they gave me a rifle and jacket.\\xa0 See over there?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd stood.\\xa0 He made his way around the desk, past Mary\\u2019s knees and mine, to reach the frame where his jacket was hung.</p>\\n<p>The moment his back was turned, Mary leaned forward.\\xa0 A deft movement of her hand over his cup of tea, and the powder was deposited from the hollow of her smallest fingernail to the tea.\\xa0 She picked up the spoon and stirred, not letting the spoon touch the edges of the cup and clink, then set it back in place, at the same angle it had been.</p>\\n<p>Lacey gave Mary a long, hard look.\\xa0 It seemed to take apparent effort to compose herself.</p>\\n<p>A good thing that the Reverend didn\\u2019t turn around.\\xa0 Oblivious, he tapped the glass, \\u201cUnlike my father\\u2019s, my jacket had a crown on the sleeve.\\xa0 My war was longer and uglier.\\xa0 I hope you understand if I don\\u2019t go into the details.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was Jamie who spoke up.\\xa0 \\u201cYour father\\u2019s war was lost with brute strength.\\xa0 The strength of stitched against men.\\xa0 Your war was won with\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAbominations,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 He turned around, making his way back to his seat.\\xa0 \\u201cYes.\\xa0 How exceptionally well put.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI read something like it in a book,\\u201d Jamie said, hugging his notebook.\\xa0 \\u201cI like books.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cI do too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you afraid of what war these children might see?\\u201d Lacey asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, Mrs. Lindsey.\\xa0 That is not my greatest fear,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>A</em> fear, but not the greatest by far.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m afraid you\\u2019ve lost me, Father.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd was settling into his chair, mouth opening to respond, when I saw the reaction.\\xa0 A momentary hesitation, while his eyes rested on his cup.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d he said, finding his stride again.\\xa0 \\u201cIt seems I have.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry.\\xa0 My thoughts are elsewhere.\\xa0 I think we may have to cut this short, it\\u2019s about time Mr. Gill and I address the room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to dwell on your education, Mary.\\xa0 I spend time worrying about the next generation, and after interacting with your father as much as I did, you\\u2019re one of the faces that spring to mind.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you very much for the cake, Father,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re very welcome,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou children are welcome any time, to talk about anything.\\xa0 There may even be cake waiting for you when you do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you!\\u201d Helen said, smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProvided you have permission from your teacher or parents to partake,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s face fell a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI appreciate you humoring me, I hope I didn\\u2019t bore,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 We shook our heads.\\xa0 \\u201cIf anyone asks, I\\u2019ll be out in a minute, no less.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFather,\\u201d I said, right away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said that your fear wasn\\u2019t so much that we\\u2019d fight in a war worse than the one you fought in, but you didn\\u2019t say what your fear really was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s complex and silly,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t make much sense, trust me.\\xa0 Taken the wrong way, it might even offend.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease?\\u201d Jamie asked, chiming in.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd looked surprisingly weary, looking at us, collecting the first of the dishes we\\u2019d left behind.\\xa0 He seemed to weigh his options a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re not as dull as you might think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He startled a little at that, then gave her an appraising look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy greatest concern, Mary Coburn,\\u201d he said, \\u201cis that there won\\u2019t be an opportunity for you to fight at all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Leaving us with that terminal dose of irony, he turned away, collecting the dishes.</p>\\n<p>From the time he\\u2019d returned to his chair to the time he saw us out the door of his homey little office, he hadn\\u2019t touched his tea.</p>\\n<p>Glancing over my shoulder, I could see through the open door as he quickly stacked saucers and gathered the scattered cups we\\u2019d left behind.\\xa0 All went to the counter by his little heating plate and kettle, likely to be washed at a later time.</p>\\n<p>I saw him carry one cup to the same counter, clearly heavier than the others.\\xa0 He unlatched his window, removed something from the top of the window, opened the window and tossed out the contents.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLacey,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She gave me an annoyed look.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t call me like a dog.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFind Cecil,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cGordon or Lillian would work too.\\xa0 Whatever they\\u2019ve been up to, we should get caught up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSay <em>please</em>?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTime is <em>really</em> of the essence,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 That was apparently enough to send her on her way.\\xa0 To her back, I added, \\u201cFetch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She stopped in her tracks, apparently decided it wasn\\u2019t worth it, and headed off again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a jerk,\\u201d Jamie commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe knew,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Shepherd.\\xa0 Something tipped him off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did it right,\\u201d Mary said, under her breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cApparently not,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cPlus side is, I think he blames Lacey.\\xa0 He seemed eager to invite <em>us</em> back, but not so much for our teacher.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary looked annoyed, apparently not even hearing what I was saying.\\xa0 \\u201cThe tea shouldn\\u2019t have even been swirling by the time he returned to it.\\xa0 The powder didn\\u2019t change the color, I even moved the spoon back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No</em>?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t the same when you put it back,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m thinking back, and the spoon was upside down.\\xa0 It was rightside up when you put it back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s <em>ridiculous</em>,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow would you even tell until you took the spoon out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey were nice spoons, maybe with marks on the underside of the handles,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cSomething you said at the beginning tipped him off.\\xa0 I think he took it to mean she\\u2019d been brainwashed or the Academy had its hooks in her.\\xa0 He took a sudden interest in your welfare.\\xa0 While getting into a protective mindset, he got into a defensive one too.\\xa0 Got a bit more cautious.\\xa0 Prey instinct, maybe.\\xa0 Probably not, but maybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSensing something wrong from clues he didn\\u2019t even consciously take in,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I had to guess, he\\u2019s been especially wary ever since the war ended.\\xa0 He had coins or something stacked in a certain order above every door or window he doesn\\u2019t tend to leave open.\\xa0 Stones left at the base of the door, so he knows if it\\u2019s been opened.\\xa0 Everything in a place, to the point where he knows if anything\\u2019s been tampered with.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause he\\u2019s paranoid, and rightly so,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe war he fought in had parasites,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe worst ones paralyzed a man, left him screaming so the Crown soldiers could collect them and turn them into stitched.\\xa0 Or just left them to scream themselves raw and die from exposure.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t blame him for being careful with his tea.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThose weren\\u2019t the worst ones,\\u201d Helen murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve seen some of the ones people don\\u2019t talk about without clearance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLovely,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut we\\u2019re getting off topic.\\xa0 Our concern is the Shepherd.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe didn\\u2019t have much to say about what he had planned,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut we did get a good chance to study him as a person, and we have a sense about his motivations now.\\xa0 That bit at the end.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAssuming you think he\\u2019s genuine,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I thought for a second.\\xa0 \\u201cAre we <em>sure</em> this guy isn\\u2019t an experiment?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause, ugh.\\xa0 He\\u2019s better at manipulating groups than any of us.\\xa0 I\\u2019d say I\\u2019m better at him at one-on-one stuff, but he did throw me off with that one line.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was funny,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 I elbowed him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s sharp, too,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen Ibott gives me lessons,\\u201d Helen said, \\u201cHe sometimes warns me not to underestimate people.\\xa0 Humans did some amazing things over the years.\\xa0 Geniuses pop up now and again, people with exceptional natural ability, or those with talent.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s just an incredible person?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cOne in a million?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>I</em> respect him,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m a little spooked at the idea of what he might do if we let him keep this up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou respect him, but you want to stop him?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI respected <em>you</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI still do, all the more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That cut <em>that</em> argument short.\\xa0 It seemed to stun her a little, put her on her heels.</p>\\n<p>I was learning little tidbits about Mary, and one was that she didn\\u2019t like to <em>fail</em>.\\xa0 This was where we differed.\\xa0 She valued the execution, while I liked getting a reaction out of people, even if it was in an indirect way, through some lesson I\\u2019d given Jamie.\\xa0 When her execution wasn\\u2019t enough, she got cranky.\\xa0 Same as I did, when I failed to budge people.\\xa0 Rick being first and foremost among them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou did good,\\u201d I told her, taking her hand.\\xa0 \\u201cProblem is, <em>he</em> did better.\\xa0 We underestimated him.\\xa0 I thought he set things up so that the <em>people</em> around him were all perfectly arranged, a chess board with every piece trapped.\\xa0 But he does it with his environment too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lacey was coming back with Cecil and Lillian.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do we do?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>The others reached us.\\xa0 Gordon was absent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did I miss?\\u201d Cecil asked.</p>\\n<p>I ignored him.\\xa0 I asked Lillian, \\u201cWhere\\u2019s Gordon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn the roof.\\xa0 He said to wave, and he\\u2019d make an entrance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I took a look around.\\xa0 The building was only two stories high, but it had been expanded, like the Shepherd had said.</p>\\n<p>On the roof, yet able to see us if we waved?</p>\\n<p>My eye fell on one of the stained glass windows.</p>\\n<p>Good old Gordon.\\xa0 He\\u2019d remembered what I\\u2019d said.</p>\\n<p><em>Taking the chess board and making an opponent\\u2019s move for him</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid he take anything?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cAsk for supplies?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSoap and a scalpel,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>I had no idea what Gordon was doing with soap and a scalpel, but I was so excited at the prospect of finding out that I could barely sit still.\\xa0 I grinned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s let Gordon enjoy the spotlight,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis plays well into what I was thinking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd what were you thinking?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight now?\\xa0 Lacey, get close to the altar.\\xa0 Everyone else?\\xa0 Spread out.\\xa0 The Reverend is going to want to assert control, keep everything in position.\\xa0 But as Mary demonstrated, he\\u2019s not so good if he\\u2019s kept on the defensive.\\xa0 Spread the word that there are riots happening elsewhere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can do that,\\u201d Cecil said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have the most important job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cImportant?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRun to the nearest telephone, as fast as you can,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cGet word to the Academy.\\xa0 Tell them there\\u2019s a riot happening here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is not the clean and tidy Hayle wanted,\\u201d Jamie reminded me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt will be,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cTrust me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Gordon</em> didn\\u2019t trust you,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think he and I are on the same page here,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Everyone moved to their assigned spots.\\xa0 Locations and positions.</p>\\n<p>Reverend Mauer had set up his own board.\\xa0 Now we were setting up ours.</p>\\n<p>I gave Cecil a few minutes, watched each of the others.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd and Gill were talking, and Gill made his way to the stage.</p>\\n<p>I saw the Shepherd looking over the crowd.\\xa0 He saw me.</p>\\n<p>I gave him a wave.</p>\\n<p>Two seconds passed.\\xa0 I supposed Gordon needed a running start.</p>\\n<p>He came crashing through the stained glass window behind the altar, head over heels, clearing a good distance.\\xa0 The landing was violent, clipping the edge of the stage.</p>\\n<p>The marks on his arms and body, scalpel-carved, looked like the gouges of claws.\\xa0 He was covered in a mucus-like slime.\\xa0 Soap.</p>\\n<p>Lacey was the one at his side.\\xa0 She helped him sit up.</p>\\n<p>He found his breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe things are attacking!\\u201d he screamed.</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/cat-out-of-the-bag-2-5/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>The press of bodies, the general shuffling and movement, and the warmth of the summer\\u2019s day made for a haze in the air.\\xa0 A fog, if fog smelled like body odor and rain.</p>\\n<p>But it was easier and more evocative to call it a symptom of the general mood.\\xa0 If one person could be so mad that steam came out of their ears, was a crowd of very upset people capable of producing this kind of atmosphere?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is not what I expected,\\u201d Gordon remarked.</p>\\n<p>I nodded in silent agreement.</p>\\n<p>A woman stopped to take notice of us as we forged our way through a tangle of legs and hips.\\xa0 She was in the company of her husband and her son, who was twice our age.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing here?\\u201d the woman asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrying to get a seat with a view,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cExcuse us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t be here,\\u201d she said, not letting him by.\\xa0 Her son nudged her, pointing at a gap in the crowd, and she shooed him off.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re too little.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes narrowed, my eyes dancing over her, taking in the simple braid, the worn seams of her clothes, and the particular lines in her face.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd you\\u2019re-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon reflexively tried to clap a hand over my mouth, but with the crowd crushing in on us and our mutual proximity, he ended up smacking me in the lower half of the face with his forearm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmph,\\u201d I said, wincing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re fine,\\u201d Gordon said, smiling.\\xa0 He partially turned my way, muttering, \\u201cSorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMff.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to get trampled.\\xa0 Emotions are running high today,\\u201d the woman told us, her voice stringent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMum,\\u201d her son said, impatient.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne moment,\\u201d she said, a little impatiently.\\xa0 She looked at us and gave us her best \\u2018mother\\u2019 voice.\\xa0 \\u201cGo home.\\xa0 It\\u2019s safer there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d Jamie said, and I had to suppress a smile at hearing his tone.\\xa0 The tone and the wide eyed look he gave her through his thick glasses was wounded, concerned, and bewildered.\\xa0 \\u201cMa\\u2019am.\\xa0 We\\u2019re orphans.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t <em>have</em> a home.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t quite how I would have timed or phrased it, but it wasn\\u2019t quite an option for me.\\xa0 I felt like if I tried to go the pitiful orphan route, someone like this woman would look me over, see the scruffy hair, see the eyes, the thin mouth, and think, \\u2018yes, that\\u2019s an orphan.\\u2019</p>\\n<p>But Jamie was another thing altogether.\\xa0 His long hair was tied back in a sailor\\u2019s ponytail, he wore glasses, and his clothes didn\\u2019t quite fit him.\\xa0 He was just a step away from being an ordinary child, so <em>fixable</em>, and the effect came across well.\\xa0 Perfect for when we wanted to put people on the defensive.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d worked with him on that one, with Helen\\u2019s help.</p>\\n<p>I did my best not to smile as I watched the woman flounder.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Mum,</em>\\u201d her son said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to lose sight of dad if you don\\u2019t hurry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She seemed caught up in the moment, but with a push one way and a pull the other\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t be here,\\u201d she reminded us, before turning away, joining her son.</p>\\n<p>I tackled Jamie, throwing my arm around his shoulder.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHmm,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was good!\\u201d\\xa0 I told him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d he said, again.\\xa0 But he smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeautifully timed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn a few years that won\\u2019t work anymore.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut it worked here, now!\\xa0 Just a second ago,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat was good!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s all it takes to make Sy\\u2019s day,\\u201d Gordon remarked.</p>\\n<p>When I looked, I saw he was talking to Mary, who was safe between him and Lil.\\xa0 Helen was closer to me and Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA good execution of a technique?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIt makes sense to me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWell, yes, maybe, but no.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMixed messages, there,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I winced as a few members of the crowd backed away, jostling us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon seemed to decide.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s not about the technique.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She looked puzzled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe-\\u201d Jamie started to chime in, then stopped short as the crowd moved again, bumping him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s move somewhere else,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He looked at the crowd ahead of us.\\xa0 People were shoulder to shoulder, hip to hip.</p>\\n<p><em>The entire neighborhood turned up</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUp there,\\u201d Helen suggested.</p>\\n<p>She was pointing at a nearby rooftop, an addition to a nearby building, larger than a shed, not quite large enough to be an adjunct stable.\\xa0 A storehouse?</p>\\n<p>Either way, it had a gently sloping roof that was low enough we could potentially climb up to it.\\xa0 We had to hop a short fence that surrounded the lawn, possibly to keep bugs away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He was entwining his fingers together.</p>\\n<p>I nodded, and picked up my pace.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t quite a running start, but I had forward momentum all the same, when he caught my foot in his hands and hauled me up.</p>\\n<p>I landed on the roof, and immediately dropped to all fours, palms and shoes skidding on the shingles before I found the traction to stop.</p>\\n<p>By the time I did, Helen had made her way up.\\xa0 Gordon very deliberately looked to one side as her dress brushed his face.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t drop to all fours as I had, but instead found her balance by touching the side of the adjacent building, her feet firmly planted on the sloped roof.\\xa0 She turned around to face the other direction, peppermint green dress flaring around bare legs, her sockless feet in little white shoes finding balance.\\xa0 I knew Helen was in the process of growing her hair longer, but for now it was in tight blonde rolls at the side and back, the rolls absorbing most of the length.</p>\\n<p>She was still smiling, giving me an amused look with a very intentionally placed gleam in her eyes.</p>\\n<p>I almost missed deadpan Helen.\\xa0 I <em>understood</em> deadpan Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHeads up!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked just in time to see Mary fly at me.</p>\\n<p>I caught the apex of the roof with one hand and Mary\\u2019s hand with the other.\\xa0 Her shoes weren\\u2019t as good for climbing as mine were, too flat on the bottom, and she skidded.</p>\\n<p>I watched her adjust her weight, the foot that was set lower on the roof sweeping in a sharp, focused half-circle, scraping the shingles for maximum traction.\\xa0 Not quite enough to stop her downward movement, but it made for less of a violent tug when I had to catch her full weight, my arms stretched in two opposite directions.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re smiling,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I hauled her up, and she found her way to the peak of the roof, standing across it.\\xa0 We had the best view of the crowd, but she was staring at me, looking puzzled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour\\u2026\\u201d I said, not finding the words.\\xa0 I made an inarticulate waving gesture toward her legs.</p>\\n<p>Mary looked down, sticking out one leg.\\xa0 She wore a white blouse and forest green skirt, and she was looking down at her bare calf.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe way you kept from falling,\\u201d Helen clarified.\\xa0 \\u201cKicking out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She still looked a little perplexed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy, Mary,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I reached out and caught Jamie\\u2019s hand.\\xa0 Mary caught his elbow, where he was holding his book with one hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were taught that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was one of a few things,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m more of a tomboy than you\\u2019d think.\\xa0 I learned a bit on my own.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo kidding,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>To please the puppeteer?</em>\\xa0 <em>To please us, now?</em>\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s impressive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She looked away as she smiled in response to that.</p>\\n<p>We caught Lillian, helping her up, and then Gordon hauled himself up on his own.</p>\\n<p>Six of us on one roof.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGrimy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 I looked down at my brown-black palms to verify, then to Lillian.\\xa0 Her dress was smudged at the knees, where she hadn\\u2019t been quite so graceful as Helen or Mary.</p>\\n<p>Straddling the roof, I pulled off my raincloak.\\xa0 I laid it across the top of the roof.</p>\\n<p>At my silent invitation, Mary sat down on one side of it.\\xa0 I plunked myself down beside her, and not because of any scheme or anything.\\xa0 Lillian might have been a girl, but it was <em>my</em> damn cloak.</p>\\n<p>Lil shot me an offended look, then arranged and sat on her satchel with all the equipment and notes.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Helen were standing, toward the side of the building, while Jamie elected to sit on his book, balancing it on the roof\\u2019s peak.</p>\\n<p>Together, finally settled with a view, we were free to look out over the crowd.\\xa0 A small handful of faces looked up at us on our perch, but nobody spoke out.\\xa0 The focus was elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>Fear, anger, agitation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething\\u2019s stirring,\\u201d I murmured.</p>\\n<p>Jamie, watching, nodded.</p>\\n<p>The church was across the street from us, not one of the largest in existence, but Radham wasn\\u2019t an overly pious town.\\xa0 The structure was pale, the shingles were brown, and the stained glass stood out all the more for the drab exterior.\\xa0 A lot of reds in the glass used for the window.</p>\\n<p>Damage sustained some time ago had led to the patching up of one of the side walls, but the branches had been heavily pruned.\\xa0 Where some buildings let the branches grow out, reaching and growing leaves, the church had cut back everything until the plant growth was almost indistinguishable from mortar.</p>\\n<p>A cart had stopped by the side door of the church, and much of the crowd had gathered around it.\\xa0 Two men were standing on or by the cart, I saw.\\xa0 They were talking, and a lot of people were listening.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not the reverend, is it?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He pointed.\\xa0 \\u201cLeft side.\\xa0 Bill Warner.\\xa0 He owns the production line down by Tenent street.\\xa0 You knew his son at Mothmont, Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, <em>yeah</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo the right, we have Dicky Gill, who really shouldn\\u2019t be here,\\u201d Jamie observed.\\xa0 \\u201cOr at least, not in this capacity.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause he\\u2019s in a position of power that the Academy gave him,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s on the shortlist to be the next mayor?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh boy,\\u201d Mary said, finally understanding.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a very short list,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cA list many people want to find themselves on.\\xa0 An academy town of the Crown States of America.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShort road to power, if he\\u2019s willing to walk it,\\u201d I remarked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy is he here, and not walking that road?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSame general feeling as Walter\\u2019s dad?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s not <em>true</em> power, it\\u2019s just being stuck in the middle while the Academy runs things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPower is a lot more tantalizing when it\\u2019s almost in reach than when you have it hand,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFor him, it\\u2019s almost in reach.\\xa0 What\\u2019s going on that\\u2019s making <em>this</em> more appealing than <em>that</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have to ask?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gave me an odd look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook.\\xa0 This crowd.\\xa0 I <em>know</em> you can tell just how upset they are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d I said, resisting an \\u2018of course\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat simmering rage?\\xa0 It\\u2019s<em> his</em>, or close to.\\xa0 This many people, restless, and he <em>owns</em> them.\\xa0 He and Warner, anyway, maybe Reverend Mauer too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Our collected eyes moved over the crowd.\\xa0 People talking in heated tones, the forceful gestures, the restlessness.\\xa0 Expressions tight, with lines of anger across foreheads and between eyebrows, grooves deep around the mouth, suggesting disgust, and eyes too wide open, revealing too much white.\\xa0 Fear.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps something more than fear, too.\\xa0 A <em>wilder</em> sort of feeling.\\xa0 Something ready to cut loose and act on things long suppressed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey only need direction,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re saying you don\\u2019t see the appeal in that?\\u201d\\xa0 Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cFor a guy who\\u2019s never had power, to now have the ability to direct <em>this</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see the appeal, I guess,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI prefer to interact with people, not crowds.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a big crowd, and it wouldn\\u2019t take much to turn this state of things into a riot,\\u201d Gordon commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis didn\\u2019t come out of nowhere,\\u201d Mary said, \\u201cDid it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cThere was work going into this.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a reason people gathered <em>here </em>at the first sign of trouble.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The church door opened.\\xa0 Conversations stopped.\\xa0 People paid attention.</p>\\n<p><em>Mauer</em>.</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t what I was expecting.</p>\\n<p>A part of me was expecting <em>Hayle</em>, someone aged, stately, perhaps a bit grim, dressed in black, with the priest\\u2019s collar.</p>\\n<p>Reverend Mauer was young, or he\\u2019d been worked on by the Academy at some point.\\xa0 His hair was vibrant, a bronze that verged on a surprising red where the sun peered through clouds to touch it, and his skin was smooth and unlined.</p>\\n<p>When he walked, it was a touch off balance, back bent to one side, almost a limp.\\xa0 He <em>did</em> wear black shirt and slacks, one arm bare , and he wore a chaplain\\u2019s collar, not the tab at the shirt, but a proper band of white that encircled his neck.\\xa0 To go with the limping gait and odd balance was a heavy sleeve that covered one arm, extending past the fingers.</p>\\n<p>The uncharitable part of me wanted to call him a <em>chicken</em>, or a cock.\\xa0 The shock of red at the top, sharp chin and a roman nose, the long, thin neck, the <em>youth, </em>and the way he walked.</p>\\n<p>But the more charitable part of me saw that he was quiet, very at ease with how he slowly took in the crowd with his eyes.\\xa0 When he moved for a purpose other than walking, his actions seemed fluid, relaxed.</p>\\n<p>His very state of being seemed to pass to them.\\xa0 The fires that had been stirring when the crowd was left on its own seemed to flicker and fade.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d pegged him for the <em>provocateur </em>of the situation with Walter and Whiskers.\\xa0 Looking at him, going by gut feeling, I suspected he was <em>far</em> from being a stupid man.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI suddenly feel like we should have gotten closer,\\u201d Gordon remarked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor what?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo be able to act.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s no way to act with this many people around,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re saying that?\\xa0 After your scene in the Mothmont cafeteria?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m\\u2026 saying there\\u2019s no way to do it without advance preparation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoint,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Then, after a second\\u2019s pause, I couldn\\u2019t hold back.\\xa0 \\u201cUgh.\\xa0 <em>Talk</em>, Mauer.\\xa0 I want to hear what you have to say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo do they,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>The crowd was paying close attention.</p>\\n<p>Mauer climbed up onto the side of the wagon, standing on the short ledge beneath the door.\\xa0 It put him a few feet above the crowd, sticking up by the waist.</p>\\n<p>Without a word, he gestured at Gill.\\xa0 Our Academy backed politician.</p>\\n<p>I only partially managed to hold back a groan.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEveryone!\\u201d Gill called out, climbing up to stand beside the Reverend Mauer, proving to be a bit shorter and somewhat plumper than the reverend.\\xa0 Still, good projection skills.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ve heard the rumors, and I have to thank you for passing the word on to others so they know what\\u2019s going on and can make sure they\\u2019re safe.\\xa0 For those who haven\\u2019t heard, <em>yes,</em> there is a creature loose from the Academy.\\xa0 It <em>is</em> dangerous to you all, but you can minimize the danger by staying in groups.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>It is dangerous to you all.\\xa0 </em>Emphasis on \\u2018is\\u2019, to strike any doubt from their minds.</p>\\n<p>Any public speaker worth his salt could have reworded that or even changed the emphasis to soften the blow to the Academy.\\xa0 He\\u2019d done it intentionally.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBad politician,\\u201d I murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cBad!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie was nodding.\\xa0 Mary leaned forward, arms around her knees, paying rapt attention.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is it!?\\u201d someone called out.</p>\\n<p><em>Yes,</em> I thought.\\xa0 <em>What is it?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cSources with the Academy have told me it\\u2019s a project meant to advance research in the five senses,\\u201d Gill said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat it\\u2019s not meant to be dangerous, but we should take care all the same.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes narrowed.\\xa0 I was aware of the murmurs and conversation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe heard people had died!\\u201d another voice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Nine individuals have been gravely hurt in and around the Academy, but so far, the damage-\\u201d Gill paused as Mauer reached out to put a hand on his shoulder, then finished his statement, \\u201c-is contained to the institution.\\xa0 They\\u2019re putting all resources forward, to stop\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He halted toward the end there, then let the sentence die unfinished.\\xa0 Mauer was using his grip on the man\\u2019s shoulder to let him know that he wanted to speak.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not true, I\\u2019m afraid,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 His voice carried, but it wasn\\u2019t <em>loud </em>like Gill\\u2019s was.\\xa0 Strong contrast.\\xa0 He paused, another contrast to Gill\\u2019s attempt to drop as much information as he could in a short span of time.</p>\\n<p>Were the contrasts intentional?\\xa0 How much were they collaborating?\\xa0 Was even this <em>interruption</em> of Gill\\u2019s reassurance calculated?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI just received word that two individuals in the upper west part of Radham were attacked.\\xa0 They were school-age.\\xa0 One of them is gravely injured, to the point that he may be crippled for life.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>His expression changed, and his face was <em>very</em> expressive, in a way that might have rivaled Helen\\u2019s own control of how she presented herself.\\xa0 The weariness in his eyes suggested he was much older than he looked.\\xa0 He looked down, taking a second to purse his lips, as if trying to get them working right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe other child is dead,\\u201d he stated, overly stiff, having waited just long enough to let people think he might have completed his last statement.</p>\\n<p>Now, again, the crowd stirred, pain, fear, anger, redoubled for the peace that Mauer had just given and taken away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease!\\u201d Mauer called out.\\xa0 His words were nearly drowned out by the noise of the crowd.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon shifted, crouching, and spoke to us, \\u201cHe can definitely speak louder than that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>He\\u2019s in full control of this crowd.\\xa0 He\\u2019s stoking the fires and bottling up the heat.\\xa0 Things are going to explode, and they\\u2019re going to explode damn soon.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho is this guy?\\u201d I asked, a little awed and impressed.\\xa0 \\u201cIs he an experiment?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPretty sure he isn\\u2019t,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI overheard about his history.\\xa0 He was a soldier in the wars down south.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe limp?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot a limp.\\xa0 He\\u2019s off balance.\\xa0 They gave him a new arm, after he lost his.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not very functional, and it\\u2019s not very pretty,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA weapon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA regular, oversized arm.\\xa0 Nothing fancy.\\xa0 It seems to cause him constant pain.\\xa0 He refused offers of further work and replacement.\\xa0 Went straight to seminary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Reverend Mauer\\u2019s shouting was picking up in volume.\\xa0 He was getting attention.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease!\\u201d Mauer said, more forcefully, almost a little angry.\\xa0 Another act.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is not about the monster, and it is not about the Academy or the mistakes they made!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s doing that on purpose,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p><em>I\\u2019m not the only one who thinks so</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Helen said, one of the few things she\\u2019d said since we\\u2019d climbed up onto the roof.\\xa0 The smile was gone from her face.\\xa0 She was deadpan again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey don\\u2019t see it?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEmotions are clouding their eyes and ears,\\u201d Gordon said, simply.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is about the children!\\xa0 Please!\\xa0 A moment of silence and a prayer!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>In the palm of his hand,</em> I thought.</p>\\n<p>I could see everything that was about to unfold.</p>\\n<p>Stoke the fires, <em>contain</em>, store the heat.\\xa0 Stoke the fires, <em>contain, </em>store the heat.</p>\\n<p>Let it all build up.</p>\\n<p>Right now, he was <em>containing</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTheir names are Martin and Oscar Meadows,\\u201d he said, and he barely had to raise his voice to be heard, now that the crowd had been silenced.\\xa0 \\u201cLet us give them a moment and a prayer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Nobody with a heart, no matter how angry they were, could dare to speak up in the midst of such a meaningful silence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs he going to start a riot?\\xa0 Directed at the Academy?\\u201d\\xa0 Lillian asked, whispering.\\xa0 We were far enough we wouldn\\u2019t be overheard.\\xa0 With the nearest members of the crowd a good thirty feet away, aiming to be closer, to <em>see</em> as well as hear, the shuffling of feet and the periodic coughs were enough to mask the whispering.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d Gordon whispered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I whispered, without missing a beat.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 Why the hell would he do that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo hurt Radham Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat good comes of that?\\xa0 They shut the doors and the gates and wait out the chaos,\\u201d I whispered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen why?\\xa0 What?\\xa0 He has <em>some</em> goal,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The silence lingered as I watched, looking over the crowd to the red haired man who was standing on the side of one coach.\\xa0 He was examining the crowd, but he hadn\\u2019t noticed us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook at him,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can\\u2019t even touch him right now.\\xa0 He\\u2019s surrounded by this many supporters, and even if he wasn\\u2019t, if we could get to him somehow, we\\u2019d only stimulate the crowd, like an electric shock to a latent stitched.\\xa0 Wake them up, drive them to action.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaking him a martyr,\\u201d Mary whispered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe has full and complete control.\\xa0 He knows what he\\u2019s doing, and he knows how dangerous it is to stand against the Academy.\\xa0 He <em>knows</em> they\\u2019re going to pay attention to him, and he can only hold his position by maintaining a very delicate sort of balance.\\xa0 Starting a riot gives up that control,\\u201d I whispered.</p>\\n<p>Reverend Mauer was peering through the crowd, finding people who weren\\u2019t at ease.\\xa0 A man who was more agitated than some, shifting weight from one foot to another, was met with a look of deep sadness from Mauer.</p>\\n<p>The agitation quieted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you <em>sure</em> this guy\\u2019s human?\\u201d I whispered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAfter his botched arm graft and new skin, I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s willing to let <em>anyone</em> touch him,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve paid a lot of attention to this guy,\\u201d Gordon remarked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s a popular topic for gossip,\\u201d Jamie whispered.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Academies don\\u2019t have the best working relationship with the churches.\\xa0 A lot of people wondered what sort of man would turn up to man a station in an <em>Academy town, </em>of all places.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI guess we know, now,\\u201d Gordon remarked.</p>\\n<p>The silence was lingering to the point that it was almost painful.\\xa0 More than a minute, easily.</p>\\n<p><em>Who are you, Reverend Mauer</em>?\\xa0 I wondered.\\xa0 <em>Are you drawing this out for your own pleasure?\\xa0 To test how firm your grip on these people is in practice?</em>\\xa0 <em>Are you focused on the same taste of power that stole Gill away from the Academy</em>, <em>or are you laboring under a goal?</em></p>\\n<p>People with their heads and eyes down were perhaps unaware, but the crowd began to shift, a little restless, as if their bodies were voicing the questions their mouths didn\\u2019t dare to.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow,\\u201d Reverend Mauer said, as if gently rousing everyone present from a dream.\\xa0 \\u201cI know you\\u2019re upset.\\xa0 It is hard not to be, given the lives that have been lost, and your fear for yourselves, your neighbors, and your loved ones.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He had everyone\\u2019s ear, and mine was no exception.\\xa0 I was hanging on every word, picking apart how he was playing with emotions, saying one thing while gently stoking the fires, validating fear and outrage.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAimless anger won\\u2019t help anyone, and would be an affront to those we\\u2019ve already lost.\\xa0 Nothing would be sadder than if we went out looking for answers or justice, only to sully the memories of Martin and Oscar, or worse, to join those killed by the escaped creature, because you were acting with <em>emotion,</em> not <em>caution</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Control.</em></p>\\n<p>Mary was giving me a sidelong glance.</p>\\n<p><em>I was right</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>What we don\\u2019t know is what your next move is.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy, from what we\\u2019ve been told, is deploying <em>more</em> creatures, weapons of war and armed men, with the intent of finding and stopping the escaped creature.\\xa0 Dog and Catcher are the <em>least</em> of the assets being brought to bear.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAcademy didn\\u2019t tell you that,\\u201d Gordon murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHard for them to turn around and say they didn\\u2019t, that they wanted to keep people in the dark,\\u201d I commented.\\xa0 Gordon nodded in agreement.</p>\\n<p><em>There isn\\u2019t a single person here that likes that.\\xa0 Phrased so well, too.</em></p>\\n<p>He went on.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t like this, but at the present time, the only thing we can do is stay safe.\\xa0 Stay with family and friends, give each other comfort.\\xa0 If you still find yourself lacking, you\\u2019ll find Dicky, Bill, and myself here in the church, with several others, ready to offer prayer and counsel, should you need it.\\xa0 If you have any news, please, come to us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSoldiers,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p><em>How many people are going to turn up at that church, talking about banding together and doing something, as if it were their idea and not Mauer\\u2019s?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cA prayer!\\u201d Mauer declared, spreading his arms slightly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s go,\\u201d I said, climbing over the roof, intent on sliding down the far side, away from Mauer.\\xa0 I peered over to make sure the landing would be clear.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Academy is going to want to be on top of this.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a bigger problem than Whiskers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBigger?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s putting himself opposite the Academy, gathering soldiers, he\\u2019s telling people about the secret projects, if only in broad strokes, and he\\u2019s making himself effectively untouchable,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is going to concern the Academy more than any murderous experiment, believe me.\\xa0 We need advice on how to move forward, and we might need <em>help</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

be a thought about our errant reverend Mauer and the riot.\\xa0 Then I caught a glimpse of the Academy, a considerable distance down the road.</p>\\n<p>Even standing so far back that we were closer to Lambsbridge Orphanage than to the Academy, I could tell that the Hedge was closed.\\xa0 Shutters closed and no doubt locked, front entrance closed with an iron gate. More security would have been used inside.\\xa0 The Hedge was the easiest and most obvious point of access for anyone looking to attack the Academy, and measures had to be taken to make it defensible, while keeping it accessible to the public.\\xa0 I suspected the measures were very similar to those in the Bowels of the Academy.</p>\\n<p>Where twice the number of men had been posted there earlier in the afternoon, it sat at over three times the usual, with ten men and ten stitched.\\xa0 The gates they guarded were only open wide enough for a man to slip through, ready to be closed at a moment\\u2019s notice.</p>\\n<p>It was getting to be later in the afternoon, now, and as long as the summer days were, the daylight was fading.\\xa0 The lights were just being turned on, in anticipation of looming sunset and evening.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you want to bet they won\\u2019t let us through?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need badges,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cSecret badges that we can flash to any member of the Academy that gets in our way.\\xa0 Maybe we can get the Academy heads to pass a rule so everyone knows they have to do <em>anything</em> we say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be useful,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Yeah,</em>\\u201d Gordon said, with a generous heaping of sarcasm and emphasis.\\xa0 \\u201cDoes anyone here think Sy wouldn\\u2019t abuse that six ways from Sunday?\\xa0 Anyone?\\xa0 Show of hands.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m hurt,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I still want badges.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hate to break it to you,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cBut nobody who knows you in the <em>slightest</em> is going to sign off on that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I huffed, sticking my hands in my pockets.</p>\\n<p>Jamie gave me a pat on the shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t be grumpy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not being grumpy!\\xa0 I think it\\u2019s <em>dumb</em> that we keep getting held back because of arbitrary stuff and secrecy.\\xa0 Half the students know us, the other half keep getting in our way.\\xa0 Like back when we were wrapping up the Mothmont thing, that guy stopping me from walking out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t say half,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t nitpick,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t use hyperbole, then,\\u201d he countered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 I was <em>generalizing.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary made a little \\u2018ahem\\u2019 sound.\\xa0 Our heads turned.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s interesting to see you interacting like this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInteresting how?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAfter meeting Sy at Mothmont, seeing how he was there, having weeks to worry about how I\\u2019d deal with all of you as a group, um.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not what I expected.\\xa0 Seeing you, him, here like <em>this</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI understand,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt takes people some time to adjust to how amazing we are.\\xa0 Me in particular.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s mouth parted a bit, but she didn\\u2019t manage to produce any vocalization.\\xa0 Beside Mary, Lillian\\u2019s hand went up to her face.</p>\\n<p>I took advantage of it, turning so I was walking backward, flashing her a smirk.\\xa0 I used a hand to push hair away from one corner of my face, where the rain had made it damp, posing like I was a hero on a cover of some seedy romance novella.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ll get used to it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie spoke up, \\u201cI think Mary might have been talking about the contrast of how you portrayed yourself at Mothmont and how <em>badly</em> you were just losing your argument with Gordon there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My smile disappeared, and I glared at Jamie.\\xa0 He, in turn, shot me a quiet, small smile that suggested he was secretly pleased with himself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie,\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re one of the very few people I can beat in a fight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn theory,\\u201d Gordon offered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike Wollstone\\u2019s ratio set is a theory,\\u201d I said,\\xa0 \\u201cAt a certain point, you have to accept that it\\u2019s a given.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m the book-reader and scholar with glasses,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy are <em>you</em> the one making the pathetic stabs at intellectual wit, here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I raised my eyebrows.\\xa0 \\u201cGordon\\u2019s bad enough, but you?\\xa0 You\\u2019re <em>asking </em>for it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I threw myself at Jamie, arms around his neck, but we didn\\u2019t stop moving toward the Academy gates.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s a dynamic,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cA big part of the dynamic is keeping Sy from becoming unbearable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>As if to illustrate the point, he reached back to take Jamie\\u2019s notebook with a reverent care, freeing Jamie\\u2019s other hand and making life harder on me in the process.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-Resent that!\\u201d I grunted out the words, meaning it in more than one sense.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy is he special?\\u201d\\xa0 Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s meant to be the unpredictable one, bending and testing rules and altering the patterns we operate in.\\xa0 Sy said you got the broad strokes from the puppeteer?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBroad strokes.\\xa0 Not necessarily all the <em>right</em> strokes.\\xa0 While I was still being questioned and tested on at the Academy, Sy told me that Evette and Ashton didn\\u2019t work out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I stopped our struggles at the mention of the names.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He sighed.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, they didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t make it past the beginning stages.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAshton was like me,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept not at all,\\u201d Lillian pointed out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept not at all,\\u201d Helen clarified.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVat grown?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 I noticed the change in her voice and body language, interacting with Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cLike you and I.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Abruptly, almost to the point that I\\u2019d call it <em>impulsively</em>, Helen reached out and touched the side of Mary\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p>The word \\u2018<em>stricken\\u2019</em> derived from the word \\u2018strike\\u2019 in the same way that <em>struck</em> was, and Mary looked more <em>stricken </em> than if she\\u2019d been <em>struck</em> with a sword.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s doing that-\\u201d I started.</p>\\n<p>Jamie pulled on the back of my shirt, forcing me to bend over to maintain free range of movement with my arms.\\xa0 I did what I could to jab at the softer sides of his belly, tickling him.</p>\\n<p><em>-on purpose, </em>I finished the sentence in my head.\\xa0 Helen wasn\\u2019t doing anything <em>wrong</em>, exactly, even if she <em>was</em> being weird.</p>\\n<p>Gordon reached out and took hold of Helen\\u2019s hand, removing it from Mary\\u2019s face.\\xa0 He stepped between the two of them and held Helen\\u2019s hand, more for Mary\\u2019s sake than for Helen\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe original plan was for each of us to have a role, a specific set of talents, and for us to be able to address any problem.\\xa0 A <em>gestalt</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI got that part,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing goes one hundred percent according to plan.\\xa0 Not all of us wound up being entirely what we were designed to be, and Sy wasn\\u2019t intended or even <em>proposed</em> for the gestalt group.\\xa0 Entirely different project, minor in the grand scheme of things.\\xa0 Hayle picked him up anyway.\\xa0 He\\u2019s, I\\u2019m blanking on the word, starts with \\u2018v\\u2019.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVersatile,\\u201d I said, redoubling my efforts to tickle Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVariable,\\u201d Jamie said, almost at the point where he was able to pull the bottom of my shirt over my head and arms.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Variable</em>,\\u201d Gordon said, probably going with Jamie because it made me wrong.\\xa0 \\u201cSy is variable, to the point where he inadvertently covers other bases.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs a scoundrel.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs Sy, whatever labels apply at the moment.\\xa0 But see, point I\\u2019m getting around to is that Sy likes to describe humanity as a collection of careening objects, bouncing and ricocheting off established boundaries.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie pinned my hands in his armpits by pressing his elbows tight to his body, and hiked up my shirt more.\\xa0 That he could talk and I couldn\\u2019t suggested he was <em>winning,</em> which was as irritating as hell.\\xa0 \\u201cHe says that because <em>he\\u2019s</em> a bouncing, random object.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSort of,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s human.\\xa0 Only things keeping him bound in and constrained are the firmest ones the Academy sets, and <em>us</em>.\\xa0 As Jamie is demonstrating.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEat dicks!\\u201d I told Gordon, my voice muffled by the shirt Jamie had pulled up around my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was scared of him, once,\\u201d Mary admitted.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd now?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSay what you will about Sy, he\\u2019s very good at making people experience that dissonance between what they expect and what they get.\\xa0 Sy <em>is</em> scary, he is dangerous and capable, you weren\\u2019t wrong when you judged it, back then.\\xa0 But now you\\u2019re with us, a member of our group, which is very possibly the safest possible place you could be when dealing with Sylvester there.\\xa0 With <em>us</em> as a whole, even.\\xa0 Keep that in mind if you\\u2019re ever entertaining the idea of stabbing us in the back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a pause.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was wondering when that was coming,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHad to be said.\\xa0 Sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was an awkward pause.\\xa0 I struggled with Jamie for a second, seriosuly annoyed at this point.\\xa0 I wanted to be able to do more to handle the Mary thing.\\xa0 Left alone, Gordon could push her away.\\xa0 I was the biggest villain of the two of us, but when Gordon hurt people, they took a while to bounce back from it.</p>\\n<p>Mary broke the silence.\\xa0 \\u201cThat stuff you were saying, in a roundabout way, am I right in interpreting that as you saying that I don\\u2019t need to worry?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow worried were you?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary\\u2019s been very tense,\\u201d Lillian volunteered.\\xa0 \\u201cWorried about how things would go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t need to worry about us in general.\\xa0 Really.\\u201d\\xa0 Damn Gordon.\\xa0 He was so good at sounding <em>sincere</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, good.\\xa0 Gosh!\\xa0 Even Helen, then?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAm I so scary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA little!\\xa0 More than a little, but if Gordon says you\\u2019re okay, and Sy\\u2019s not protesting\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was silent.</p>\\n<p>Gordon jumped in, stumbling with his words in a way he usually didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m\\u2026 saying that you don\\u2019t need to worry about us <em>in general</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>You\\u2019re a cruel, cruel man, Gordon</em>.</p>\\n<p>Correcting her about Helen without saying anything outright.</p>\\n<p>Nobody was saying anything.\\xa0 I suspected Mary\\u2019s fears about Helen had been redoubled, and I had further suspicions that Gordon had done it on purpose.</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t as confident about Mary being a part of the group as I was, or he was concerned on a level.\\xa0 Just as he\\u2019d talked about the group keeping me in line, he was using Helen as the proverbial whipping stick for Mary.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t so keen on that.\\xa0 Mary had enough sticks.</p>\\n<p>I struggled to pull my shirt down, while Jamie interfered with those struggles.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re at the academy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 The meaning was clear.\\xa0 <em>Stop roughhousing</em>.</p>\\n<p>Jamie let me free.\\xa0 I fixed my shirt and tucked it in, then fixed my hair.\\xa0 Mary was giving me an amused look, and Jamie looked smug.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t <em>proud</em>.\\xa0 I was willing to look silly in front of Mary if it meant she could let her guard down a fraction, easing into the group.\\xa0 Losing to Jamie was part of that.</p>\\n<p>Entirely intentional.\\xa0 For real.\\xa0 No joke.</p>\\n<p>The people by the entrance gathered together as we drew closer.\\xa0 The six of us against ten or so Academy students and their stitched.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been invited,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo entry,\\u201d one of them said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been invited,\\u201d Gordon said, again.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>One way to win an argument, just keep hammering at them until they give way.\\xa0 If they tire or show weakness, seize on that, hammer again</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo entry,\\u201d the same student told us.</p>\\n<p>Gordon looked at Jamie.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s prediction had been right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo inside, find and talk to Professor Hayle.\\xa0 He\\u2019ll tell you we\\u2019re allowed inside.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019ll tell us the same thing every other Professor has told us.\\xa0 Nobody in or out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was the same problem I\\u2019d had with Rick.\\xa0 We could be manipulative, we could poke, prod, bait, and mislead, and if we found any give at all, we could capitalize on it.</p>\\n<p>No give here.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProfessor Hayle told us to run an errand, and report back at the earliest possible moment.\\xa0 If you don\\u2019t let us past, it\\u2019s going to upset him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m willing to take that risk.\\xa0 You\\u2019re being irritating.\\xa0 <em>Go home</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is our home,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s <em>my</em> home.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man studied her, up and down.\\xa0 Helen didn\\u2019t look like a proper student.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen Ibott,\\u201d she said, extending a hand for him.\\xa0 \\u201cYes.\\xa0 I <em>am</em> his daughter.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The name carried weight.\\xa0 I saw two men behind our obstacle exchanging glances.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s not married,\\u201d our antagonist said, unmoved.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m still his daughter,\\u201d Helen said, without flinching.</p>\\n<p>One of the two spoke up.\\xa0 \\u201cI could just run over to Claret Hall and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s no need.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was so <em>stupid</em>.\\xa0 Such a waste.</p>\\n<p>Mary stepped back a bit, until she was standing to one side of me.\\xa0 Her voice was soft, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re very good at fighting.\\xa0 I could try something, make a distraction, and we could slip through.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToo messy,\\u201d I murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s interesting that you think you could win against ten people and ten stitched,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think I could win.\\xa0 I do think I could get us inside and slip away.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.\\xa0 Interesting.\\xa0 Gordon couldn\\u2019t do that, and Gordon could probably beat her in a scrap, but she did have techniques and talents.</p>\\n<p>Everything about the group fit together, a larger puzzle of talents, strengths and weaknesses.\\xa0 Every element was a thing I could potentially use or a thing I had to account for.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re Vernon,\\u201d Jamie said, cutting off Gordon mid-sentence.\\xa0 \\u201cCornet?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Our barrier to entry nodded, frowning a little.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s my name.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were working on the group project last year, Claret Hall, the kit.\\xa0 Smaller, lighter pack for field care of soldiers and stitched on the battlefield.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Vernon didn\\u2019t respond, but his frown deepened.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt didn\\u2019t go well, I heard,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t my fault.\\xa0 The others dropped the ball.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut it was such an unfettered disaster that your classmates talked about it, and I heard about it, and I <em>remember </em>hearing about it.\\xa0 A year later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat went wrong?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 I suspected it was out of genuine curiosity rather than an effort to play along.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey took it on themselves to develop a smaller, lighter pack.\\xa0 A basic failure would be producing something smaller and lighter, but <em>less effective,\\u201d </em>Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut when you design by committee, and you somehow produce something heavier, bulkier, and less effective, a failure on every count\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Vernon suddenly looked exceptionally unhappy.\\xa0 \\u201cI said it wasn\\u2019t my fault.\\xa0 Why even bring this up?\\xa0 You think I\\u2019m going to let you in because of it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not that cunning.\\xa0 I remembered and thought it was interesting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I picked up the slack.\\xa0 \\u201cBut if you\\u2019re trying to earn brownie points by pulling volunteer duty standing guard, and being a problem because you\\u2019re trying too hard to do your job, well, the professors are going to get upset we weren\\u2019t able to report in\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I trailed off, letting someone else pick up.\\xa0 Gordon for that note of authority and command, perhaps.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe might have to drop your name, Vernon Cornet,\\u201d the \\u2018daughter\\u2019 of Doctor Ibbot said, instead.</p>\\n<p>Just as good.</p>\\n<p>Vernon looked over his shoulder, \\u201cGo find one of the professors and ask if the kids are allowed in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHayle,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHayle,\\u201d Vernon corrected.</p>\\n<p>We settled in for a wait.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Claret Hall was the rare sort of building that was entirely <em>grown</em>.\\xa0 The wood had been given a deep red color as part of the growing process, it had been shaped every step of the way, and made into a veritable work of art.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was the starting point and end goal for most members of Radham Academy.\\xa0 Students took their introductory classes here, Lillian included, and those who climbed the ranks and proved their mettle ended up as part of the administration, elsewhere in the building.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The guard had gone in and found Hayle, then reported back to us with his location.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As a group, we entered one of the faculty-only rooms.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Professors Briggs, Sexton, Hayle, Fletcher and Reid were all present, in black lab coats.\\xa0 They sat in chairs, stood, or leaned against the tables around the perimeter of the rooms.\\xa0 Though it was summer, a fire blazed in the fireplace opposite the entrance.\\xa0 Two plates with only morsels of food remaining on them suggested that some but not all had eaten their dinners.\\xa0 The wine glasses were full, the firelight catching the contents and making the deep reds into something bright.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The other professors didn\\u2019t pay us much mind as we approached.\\xa0 The glances they deigned to give us were almost disinterested.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Briggs was the one to impress.\\xa0 He ran Claret Hall, and through that position, he was the head of the Academy, controlled much of Radham, and a fair portion of the surrounding area.\\xa0 He was older but not <em>old</em>, and unlike Hayle he had colored his hair and rejuvenated his skin.\\xa0 He looked as if he\\u2019d stretched himself a half-foot taller, but retained the same body weight, making him into a living caricature of the man he\\u2019d once been.\\xa0 His fingers were spidery, one hand holding a wine glass, the other on the desk, pads of the fingers pressing down so the fingers themselves bowed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The armless, crimson-tinted glasses that were perched halfway down his nose were purely for show, but they caught the firelight as he stared at the source of it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It might have been my association with Hayle, but I <em>tended</em> to have less respect for those who\\u2019d gone so far to alter themselves with medicine and surgery.\\xa0 Professor Briggs was an exception.\\xa0 It was hard to disrespect a man who could terminate the Lambsbridge project, or terminate the Wyvern project and me with it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He was, in an indirect way, responsible for the existence of the Lambs, for Dog and Catcher, for the Hangman, Gorger, Foster, the Whelps and all the rest.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">His pet project, however, wasn\\u2019t out and about, hunting for Whiskers.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hayle wanted to prove our worth as a group.\\xa0 This was where it counted.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I touched the small of Gordon\\u2019s back before he could say anything.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t give any indication that I\\u2019d done anything, but he did remain silent.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cInsurrection,\\u201d I said, as we drew close enough to be in earshot.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">That turned heads.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Briggs, however, was unfazed.\\xa0 \\u201cWe expected something in that vein.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cReverend Mauer.\\xa0 He\\u2019s got Dicky Gill and Mr. Warner at his back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGill was already restless, suggesting something was wrong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat something is the Reverend,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s probably been laying groundwork for a long time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSince he arrived in Radham three years and two months ago,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Briggs nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHe told a crowd that two people were killed by the experiment,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I looked at Jamie.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUpper-west part of Radham.\\xa0 Oscar and Martin Meadows?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was Sexton who answered.\\xa0 Young as professors went, pale, with blond hair neatly parted, he had a shadow on his chin that suggested he hadn\\u2019t had time to shave earlier in the day.\\xa0 \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t hear about that, and we should have.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt was probably a lie,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd if he can lie about that, he\\u2019ll lie about other things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUseful information,\\u201d Hayle commented.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOf course you think so,\\u201d Fletcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re <em>yours.</em>\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI prefer action to information.\\xa0 Unless your children removed the problem, Hayle?\\u201d\\xa0 Professor Briggs asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf they didn\\u2019t, there was a good reason for it,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cGordon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe couldn\\u2019t reach him, and we thought we should ask, just in case.\\xa0 Mauer is surrounded himself with people, and he\\u2019s preparing them as soldiers.\\xa0 The crowd nearly rioted.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe can handle a riot,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s poor timing, but if he\\u2019s determined to be inconvenient about this-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHe\\u2019s not,\\u201d I interrupted.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Briggs frowned.\\xa0 He finally turned away from the fire and looked at me.\\xa0 When he spoke, however, he remarked, \\u201c<em>Six</em>, Hayle?\\xa0 Are they multiplying somehow?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMary over there, with the ribbons and brown hair, is a new addition to the Lambsbridge program.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI didn\\u2019t authorize the increased budget.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI didn\\u2019t use one.\\xa0 It was Percy who developed her.\\xa0 I simply took over guardianship of her after he fled.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBrilliant,\\u201d Fletcher said, under his breath.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I suspected the man was quite drunk.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou told me I had discretion to manage the project as I saw fit,\\u201d Hayle said, in a tone that was overly clear and calm.\\xa0 He was trying to frame it all so that if Briggs spoke out, he\\u2019d sound unreasonable.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf you aren\\u2019t misappropriating funds, I don\\u2019t care,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe project has yet to impress, I don\\u2019t see how seven disappointments are much worse than six.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Seven?</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Oh.\\xa0 He was counting Evette and Ashton in the number.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Insulting them.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Considering that I\\u2019d never even <em>met</em> them, I felt a surprising degree of loathing for the man who\\u2019d insulted their memory.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I must have been giving some indication of what I was feeling, because Jamie bumped into me, his hand finding mine, clutching it hard.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf your children are incapable of dealing with the Reverend, Hayle, then we can have the Hangman accompany them to the church.\\xa0 Once they point the way, the Hangman can deal with the Reverend.\\xa0 Kill the problem at its root, then deal with the peripheral concerns, it\\u2019s a matter of time before we find our escaped project.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat won\\u2019t work,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you could show Professor Briggs an appropriate amount of respect by not interrupting him or jumping in to correct him, I would <em>very much</em> appreciate it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He put emphasis on \\u2018very much\\u2019, in a way that insinuated Hayle might have me put down if I didn\\u2019t shut up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m showing Professor Briggs respect by not letting him make a mistake that would reflect badly on him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hayle didn\\u2019t say anything, but the look in his eyes promised consequences.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhy wouldn\\u2019t it work?\\u201d Briggs asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHe knows very well who you are, what the Academy is, and what you\\u2019re capable of.\\xa0 He\\u2019s clever, and he\\u2019s positioned everything in such a way that you\\u2019ll pay in spades for anything you do to him.\\xa0 Kill him, and you martyr him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAs I said, we can handle riots.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd as I said,\\u201d I pointed out, without missing a beat, \\u201cHe\\u2019s not concerned with being <em>inconvenient</em>.\\xa0 He\\u2019s set on making himself <em>convenient, </em>entirely<em> essential </em>to the smooth running of Radham.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t dare look away from Briggs, in case he took it to mean I was weak, but I was pretty sure Hayle was ready to kill me.\\xa0 One didn\\u2019t generally <em>debate</em> with Professor Briggs.\\xa0 He had the clout and power to handle most problems in a direct means.\\xa0 He probably <em>could</em> handle this situation by throwing everything he had at it, and he wouldn\\u2019t regret the aftermath, messy as it might be.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExplain,\\u201d Briggs said.</p>\\n<p>It was Gordon who explained.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s been planting seeds and nourishing them in key people.\\xa0 Yes, if you have him killed, you\\u2019ll have riots.\\xa0 But things don\\u2019t end there.\\xa0 He\\u2019s reached some of your students.\\xa0 He\\u2019s reached major figures across the city.\\xa0 He\\u2019s playing a game of chess, and he\\u2019s laid out the board so you can\\u2019t take one of his pieces without his taking two of yours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have more pieces,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 The man didn\\u2019t even flinch.</p>\\n<p>He was fully prepared to wage a war if it came down to it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have more pieces, but he has an agenda,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019ll spread word to other cities, other Academies, because <em>that\\u2019s</em> how he can hurt you best.\\xa0 He\\u2019s already telling people about the special projects.\\xa0 Word might leak out in other cities, they might have problems now and again, they might even have a riot now and again, but if he makes <em>everything</em> go wrong, lets <em>all</em> the information slip, he could make Radham look like a <em>joke.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Looking at Briggs, he most definitely didn\\u2019t like that.\\xa0 I wondered if it was concern for the problem or the implication that Radham could even be a joke.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have to say,\\u201d Fletcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne thing I like about Dog and Catcher is that they don\\u2019t <em>talk</em> so much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lambs aren\\u2019t like Dog and Catcher,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey <em>are</em>, I should stress, much better equipped to solve problems that brute force won\\u2019t answer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo you say,\\u201d Professor Briggs said.\\xa0 He pursed his lips a little.</p>\\n<p>It looked like he was going to say something, but the doors opened.</p>\\n<p>A man in a grey coat strode into the faculty room.\\xa0 The room was large enough it took him a few seconds to get into earshot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWord got out,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout three more escapes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree <em>more</em>?\\u201d Sexton asked, voice arching.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly one we know of, but it was visible.\\xa0 Large enough to be seen as it climbed the wall.\\xa0 Bullets wounded it but didn\\u2019t stop it.\\xa0 Citizens are talking about there being <em>three</em>, which-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs a lie,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cOur Reverend is in full control right now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow very fortunate that we had your Lambs to inform us what was really happening,\\u201d Briggs said, with a note of sarcasm.\\xa0 \\u201cLambs.\\xa0 You can do this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 And he was exactly the right person to say it with utter confidence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll need some things,\\u201d Hayle said, \\u201cto better coordinate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes widened.\\xa0 I jumped in.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need two things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Oh, the look Hayle gave me there.\\xa0 I\\u2019d promised to be good, but I suspected I\\u2019d never get another chance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo things?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHayle might need more.\\xa0 But for us\\u2026 badges.\\xa0 A way to get past the blockades and general interference.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHand written notes,\\u201d Briggs said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith something permanent after?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>I was testing my luck, considering the tension I felt from my fellow Lambs, Hayle, and Briggs, and the incredulity on the other professor\\u2019s faces.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPossibly,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need an adult,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/05/09/cat-out-of-the-bag-2-9/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>As situations went, it was chaos.\\xa0 People flocked closer to Gordon and fled to the edges of the room.\\xa0 There were shouts, cries of fear, conflicting orders.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was a good-looking guy, if I looked past the minor details of rips, tears, blood and the goop he\\u2019d smeared on himself.\\xa0 Tall, broad shouldered, muscular.\\xa0 He was good at whatever he set his mind to, a step behind me in assessing people, a step behind Jamie in memory, and he had a lot of other talents besides.\\xa0 More than any one of us, he had everything it took to thrive if separated from the group.\\xa0 The lynchpin that would hold us together.\\xa0 Girls liked him, guys respected him.</p>\\n<p>And this, that he got to be at the center of this chaos, the stone that set the ripples in motion, <em>this</em> was what made me jealous of him for the first time.</p>\\n<p>That he got to lie there and bleed while we had to do the work, pshh.\\xa0 Salt in the wound.</p>\\n<p>My eye was on the Shepherd.</p>\\n<p>To his credit, he didn\\u2019t miss a beat.\\xa0 He was already moving as fast as he was able, toward Gordon.\\xa0 As people shouted and argued, some turning toward the door, he properly <em>shouted</em> for the first time that I\\u2019d heard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay inside where it\\u2019s safe!\\u201d he shouted.</p>\\n<p>Heads turned, the chaos settled a fraction.\\xa0 People who were heading for the door slowed or stopped.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo!\\u201d\\xa0 Gordon shouted, twisting, turning.\\xa0 He struggled against Lacey\\u2019s grip, as well as the grip of two men who\\u2019d jumped to his side, and in the process, he made momentary eye contact with me.\\xa0 He maintained it as he shouted, \\u201cNo!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>When I was sure he could see, and that the Shepherd didn\\u2019t have line of sight, I gestured.\\xa0 Ring, middle, and index fingers flicked upward twice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to kill us all!\\u201d Gordon screamed, thrashing as Lacey tried to hold him down, steadily ratcheting up the intensity.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to kill us!\\xa0 It\\u2019s going to kill us!\\xa0 It\\u2019s going to kill us!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>This was a balancing act.\\xa0 We didn\\u2019t want disaster, riots, or madness.\\xa0 We wanted the situation to be almost unmanageable, with emphasis on the word \\u2018almost<em>\\u2018</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGill!\\u201d the Shepherd called out.\\xa0 \\u201cThrough my office to my room.\\xa0 I have four guns.\\xa0 Two pistols in the desk, rifle by the bed, the third-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-Shotgun, in the cabinet, will do,\\u201d our would-be mayor said.\\xa0 He recruited two people with a gesture.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd approached Gordon, but turned to a group by the door.\\xa0 \\u201cTerry, Hews, Arthur, I know you\\u2019ve done the gardening work for me.\\xa0 You know where the stuff is stored.\\xa0 Pole-saws, pitchforks, chopping knife.\\xa0 Anything that can be used as weapons.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t go-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to die!\\u201d Gordon screamed.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease, please, God!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-Outside!\\u201d the Shepherd had to raise his voice to be heard.\\xa0 \\u201cGo through the back, the shed has two doors!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Clear, sensible directions, giving the people here something to rally to.\\xa0 Weapons gave them back a kind of power.\\xa0 Taking the group that was closest to bolting it and empowering them.</p>\\n<p>To their backs, as they crossed the church, he said, \\u201cWe\\u2019re counting on you!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Turning them into heroes.</p>\\n<p>Gordon twisted, screaming, \\u201cGet off me, let me go!\\xa0 It\\u2019s going to get me, they\\u2019re going to get me!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was able to see Gordon, in the midst of pulling ineffectually at Lacey\\u2019s grasp, an <em>intentional</em> sort of ineffectual, give her two taps on the side.\\xa0 The universal signal for release.\\xa0 It was discreet, subtle as such things went, in an area where most wouldn\\u2019t be looking, and those who didn\\u2019t know he was acting might not realize it was an intentional double-tap.</p>\\n<p>She let up on her grip of him, and he chose that same moment to pull free, still thrashing, playing out a mindless panic.</p>\\n<p>In the doing, he threw one fist out, and he socked the Shepherd one, right in the jaw.</p>\\n<p><em>No!</em>\\xa0 I screamed in my mind, while forcing my expression to match the crowd around me, which was aghast in a completely different way.\\xa0 <em>No, no, why!?</em></p>\\n<p><em>Why does he get to do this part?</em></p>\\n<p>It was, as maneuvers went, a pretty damn good one, I had to admit that much.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t even sure I would have done better, in his shoes.\\xa0 My acting would have beat his, probably, I could have chosen my words better, but I couldn\\u2019t have delivered a hit like he did.\\xa0 Even if I\\u2019d gone for the Shepherd\\u2019s balls, I wasn\\u2019t sure I would have hurt him quite as much.</p>\\n<p>It was something Gordon was good at.\\xa0 When he hit someone, even at almost half the size and body weight he could achieve one day, it <em>hurt</em>.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t just the punch.\\xa0 It was the fact that his hand was already messy with his own blood, and now the Shepherd was bloodied, his face a reminder of the danger.\\xa0 He wiped his cheek with a handkerchief, but there was still a smear.</p>\\n<p>The second part of it was that he\\u2019d hit the Shepherd in the mouth, and it hadn\\u2019t been a tap, either.\\xa0 Gordon was stronger than most.</p>\\n<p>As if time had slowed down, I could see the Shepherd scooting back a bit, eyes opened wide, moving his jaw as if to test how functional it was.\\xa0 For a man who relied so much on his words, it had to hurt on a complete other level.</p>\\n<p>I would never say that Gordon was anything but a genius.\\xa0 A genius that was now being pinned down by three grown men, with Lacey close by.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay-\\u201d The Shepherd started.\\xa0 He winced a little, then managed to say, not to Gordon but to the room, \\u201cStay calm.\\xa0 We cannot panic!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease, please!\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He was winding down, struggling less, perhaps sensing that he\\u2019d used up all the leeway and influence he\\u2019d been afforded, or he was saving his strength and his words for when he could have more impact.</p>\\n<p>He twisted around, looking my way once again.</p>\\n<p>I glanced around the room.\\xa0 I\\u2019d situated myself just to one side of the central aisle, standing on one of the pews, so that I had a view of everyone.\\xa0 Jamie, Lillian, Helen, and Mary were all at different points at the perimeter of the room.\\xa0 Gordon and the Shepherd were just beside the altar, in plain view of everyone.</p>\\n<p>I offered him the same gesture as before.\\xa0 An \\u2018up\\u2019 twitch of the fingers.</p>\\n<p>The way I saw it, if he couldn\\u2019t meet the request and up the tension again, then I got to be smug.\\xa0 If he <em>did </em>have it in him, then we could potentially solidify our hold on the situation before the people came back with the weapons.</p>\\n<p>I figured there was a three out of ten chance I\\u2019d get to be smug.\\xa0 Gordon was too good at thinking clearly through moments of crisis.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease,\\u201d Gordon said, in an agonized way that might have broken more sensitive hearts in the room.\\xa0 It sounded like he was giving up.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease.\\xa0 They\\u2019re going to come after us.\\xa0 We\\u2019re all going to die if we don\\u2019t do something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>They?</em>\\u201d the Shepherd asked.\\xa0 The room was almost silent, every set of ears listening.\\xa0 \\u201cA moment ago you said \\u2018it\\u2019.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a mother?\\xa0 And it has babies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gill and his buddies re-entered the room, carrying their guns.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was able to intuit that that arrival meant we needed just a <em>little</em> bit more of a push to leave the Shepherd with a little bit less in the way of control.\\xa0 He added, in a hollow, breathy voice, \\u201cLots of babies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was all I could do to avoid grinning.\\xa0 We\\u2019d dealt with threats that bred, on two separate occasions.\\xa0 The Fishing Man, so named because of a mispronunciation of \\u2018fission\\u2019, had been bad, though the problem had ultimately corrected itself.\\xa0 The Wise Rats had been worse, another all-hands-on-deck situation, though it had been far tidier, confined to one laboratory building.\\xa0 It had taken three weeks to clean up the mess.</p>\\n<p>I imagined the people here were now contemplating the implications.\\xa0 They had no damn idea what could happen when something fertile got loose.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd might have had a better idea, he\\u2019d been part of the war down south, but he didn\\u2019t flinch, didn\\u2019t crack, but I could see that his attention was elsewhere as the others around Gordon asked a flurry of questions.\\xa0 What was it, could he describe it, how did it happen?</p>\\n<p>He knew what experiments had escaped, had used connections to reach students and manipulated those students into acting against the Academy.\\xa0 He wouldn\\u2019t have urged anyone to release something that bred or multiplied.\\xa0 There was too much chance that things would get out of control.</p>\\n<p><em>What\\u2019s more likely?\\xa0 Do you think that the Academy is sending the bad stuff after you, or do you think there\\u2019s something suspicious going on with Gordon?</em></p>\\n<p><em>How do you process this, how do you move forward?</em></p>\\n<p>I was genuinely interested.\\xa0 I respected our enemy.\\xa0 I <em>liked</em> him.\\xa0 I wanted to see how he functioned when the chips were down, the situation bad and inexplicable.</p>\\n<p>He was stone faced, eyes not focused on anything in particular.</p>\\n<p>He raised his eyes only as the group from the shed returned.\\xa0 They each carried between two and four tools that served as weapons.\\xa0 Poles with saws on the edges, sometimes used for trimming buildings, sledgehammers, a short chopping sword, bent halfway down the blade, used for tending to growing woodwork, a pitchfork and a two-handed shovel with a pointed end.</p>\\n<p>They passed them out to friends.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was still describing the \\u2018monster\\u2019 that had thrown him through the window, in the most incomprehensible, breathless manner he could.\\xa0 \\u201cBig, and scaly, and it drooled and it had ears and it picked me up with these smaller arms and carried me up, but when I kicked it, it threw me with the big arms.\\xa0 That\\u2019s when I got this cut, then I kicked it again, and it threw me the other way, and then I got thrown through the window.\\xa0 It\\u2019s out there!\\xa0 The mother thing and all the babies and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHush, hush!\\xa0 Quiet.\\xa0 You\\u2019re safe now,\\u201d a man reassured a seemingly panicked Gordon.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d joked with Rick, earlier in the day, that my brain ran hot sometimes.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t, but it felt like it was getting close.\\xa0 There were more than a hundred faces and postures to focus on, people, positions, fashion, track records, all making this moment exactly what it was.</p>\\n<p>There were people around me. Unfamiliar faces.</p>\\n<p>Everything had to be balanced and weighed.</p>\\n<p>Maybe a gentle push to start.\\xa0 The room was paralyzed, caught in indecision.\\xa0 The man in authority was lacking, bleeding.\\xa0 Gill was up there by the Shepherd, now, half-kneeling and talking at a volume I couldn\\u2019t make out from the other end of the church.</p>\\n<p>If the Shepherd wasn\\u2019t going to make a move, I\\u2019d have to at least act to counterbalance the impact of the group with the makeshift weapons.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not safe at all,\\u201d I said, under my breath.</p>\\n<p>A woman near me reached out, putting her hand on my head, while saying nothing.</p>\\n<p>The gentle push wasn\\u2019t enough.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not safe at all,\\u201d I said, again, just a little bit louder.\\xa0 \\u201cWe might be getting surrounded by the monsters.\\xa0 We need to run, before they close in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>If she said \\u2018no\\u2019, then I\\u2019d gain no ground, and would have to find another way to <em>push</em>.\\xa0 But the entire room was hanging on Gordon\\u2019s words, the impact he\\u2019d made.\\xa0 Maybe, if she was undecided, that would be the deciding element?</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t <em>her</em> that I wound up pushing into action.\\xa0 A man nearby spoke, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to peek outside.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs the way clear?\\u201d I asked, the words leaving my mouth before he\\u2019d even closed his mouth.\\xa0 If I could attach my statement to his, make it seem like his idea\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not going out there,\\u201d he said, without turning.\\xa0 Too much to hope for.\\xa0 People weren\\u2019t cogs in a machine.\\xa0 They were milling around, looking for an out.\\xa0 I had to guess how they\\u2019d weigh risk versus reward, or one risk versus another, and then use that.\\xa0 I\\u2019d guessed wrong here.</p>\\n<p>The woman beside me touched my head again, smoothing my tousled hair, as if that would reassure me and not irritate me nine ways from Sunday.</p>\\n<p>I ducked out from under her grip, hopping down from the pew.\\xa0 I\\u2019d lost cachet with this particular section of the crowd.\\xa0 I could move elsewhere and try again.</p>\\n<p>I found Mary, closer to the front.\\xa0 From where Gordon was, up by the altar, Mary all the way over to the rightmost wall, in the corner closest to the stage.\\xa0 Lillian was in the back corner, only a few paces from the door.</p>\\n<p>Mary was looking my way.\\xa0 I gave her a \\u2018come here\\u2019 wave.</p>\\n<p>Lillian wasn\\u2019t looking my way, and a furtive motion on my part didn\\u2019t get her attention.\\xa0 The way she was standing, there were too many people around her who blocked her view of the surroundings.\\xa0 Her attention was on the stage.\\xa0 On Gordon.</p>\\n<p>Our Mary worked better in coordination with the rest of us than Lillian did.\\xa0 That was after being with us a <em>day.</em>\\xa0 Lillian had been with us for a handful of months.</p>\\n<p>I shook my head, turned around, and moved through the crowd to get to Lillian.\\xa0 I pushed against people and jostled them aside.\\xa0 Any more agitation was a good thing, even if it was mild annoyance.</p>\\n<p>I seized Lillian\\u2019s hand and hauled her over to the other side of the church.</p>\\n<p>Gill was saying something.\\xa0 I was only barely processing it.\\xa0 Orders.\\xa0 Aim at the window above, in case it comes through.\\xa0 Organizing people in groups.\\xa0 The words were just noise.\\xa0 People listened, but our would-be mayor didn\\u2019t have the clout.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd was oddly quiet.\\xa0 Unable to talk?\\xa0 Unwilling?</p>\\n<p><em>Thinking?</em></p>\\n<p>Jamie had told me that I\\u2019d built my personality and means of dealing with people by copying and studying the adults around me.\\xa0 It had been a necessary thing, a scrabbling for control when I\\u2019d been subjected to appointment after appointment, the space between filled with every imaginable form of testing, for sanity, for memory, for competence of all stripes.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d learned to read people because I\\u2019d had to.\\xa0 The Shepherd, though, was the first person I <em>wanted</em>.\\xa0 I wanted him in a box where I could make him perform and glean everything I could.</p>\\n<p>It was his charisma.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t the usual sort of charisma like Gordon or Helen might show off when they were \\u2018on\\u2019.\\xa0 Not smiles and warmth.\\xa0 When he spoke, when he acted, he tended to achieve things.\\xa0 When he didn\\u2019t speak, as was the case right now, people were left waiting, hanging on the silence, in anticipation of the words.</p>\\n<p>They didn\\u2019t know the particulars, not exactly.\\xa0 He was someone born with an enormous amount of natural talent for something, and after being altered irrevocably by the Academy, its war, and the modifications it made to his body, he\\u2019d found the drive to dig deep and utilize that talent.</p>\\n<p><em>I</em> was one of the people in his thrall, in a way.\\xa0 I very much wanted to hear him speak, to study him\\u2026 but we\\u2019d left him speechless.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to push until he found his voice.</p>\\n<p>With Lillian trailing behind me, her hand in mine, stumbling to keep up, I hopped up onto a pew mid-stride, tugging on her arm as I made my way up.\\xa0 Her hand slipped from mine.</p>\\n<p>I found the others, hopped down, and crossed the remainder of the distance.\\xa0 Mary had already made it, without Lillian slowing her down.</p>\\n<p>Half of us crawled under a table that had been placed in a nook, books on top, formed a huddle, heads so close together that the sides of some of our foreheads touched. To onlookers, we were sort of hiding under a tablecloth.\\xa0 Friends finding security among one another, clustered together.</p>\\n<p>Mary looked far from secure, squeezed in next to Helen.\\xa0 Helen, for her part, was smiling a little, but apparently oblivious.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was late to arrive, worming her way into the cluster beside me.\\xa0 I gave her a pinch in the side, and she hit me <em>far</em> harder than necessary, in retaliation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you think?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think we need a stampede for the door,\\u201d I whispered.\\xa0 \\u201cI was going to try and move the crowd, spread fear and suspicion, but they feel too safe indoors.\\xa0 If we could take that safety away\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can take that safety away,\\u201d Mary murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cI can.\\xa0 We cut the power.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need the situation manageable,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou want a manageable stampede?\\u201d\\xa0 Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI <em>wanted</em> a manageable riot,\\u201d I whispered, \\u201cI thought spreading the word through the crowd would make people more restless than it did.\\xa0 The Shepherd is so good, damn it.\\xa0 We need\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I floundered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStart with the basics,\\u201d Jamie suggested.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cThe whole idea was to start a localized riot.\\xa0 If Cecil did his job and avoided getting eaten by Whiskers while running around in the rain, the Academy can arrive, shut down the riot in the early stages, and lay the blame at the Shepherd\\u2019s feet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEaten by Whiskers?\\u201d Lillian asked, horrified.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot important right now,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCecil\\u2019s <em>nice</em>!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot the word I would have chosen,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDense, unhelpful-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s <em>nice</em>, Sy!\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe means well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen someone says \\u2018means well\\u2019, they mean the person is dumber than a stitched chicken.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Lillian said, her tone suddenly hostile.\\xa0 \\u201cNot another word about Cecil.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGreat!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause Cecil doesn\\u2019t matter.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She reached out, grabbed the general vicinity of my nipple through my cloak and shirt, and did a twisty sort of pinch, hard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAgh!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBack on topic?\\u201d Jamie suggested, very diplomatically.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFuck, that hurts,\\u201d I said, rubbing my chest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cManageable stampede?\\u201d Jamie reminded me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cManageable stampede,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I looked over my shoulder at the Shepherd.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 Even a regular stampede.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRegular stampede,\\u201d Jamie said, in the same disbelieving tone that Lillian had used when I\\u2019d brought up the idea.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to see how he deals with it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like to remind you that Hayle needs you to impress?\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t need reminders, my memory isn\\u2019t that bad,\\u201d I lied.\\xa0 I\\u2019d almost forgotten.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s fine.\\xa0 We\\u2019re good.\\xa0 Even if things get sloppy, the Academy should be close.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like more confidence than \\u2018should\\u2019,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToo bad,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cUnless you have a better idea\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shook his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrust me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis from the least trustworthy person in Radham,\\u201d Lillian muttered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Trust me.\\xa0</em> He has something up his sleeve.\\xa0 We need to rattle him way harder to make him show his hand.\\xa0 We still have cards to play.\\xa0 Gordon is a big one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie pursed his lips.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI trust him on this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHa!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThought not.\\xa0 Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know for sure, but\\u2026 feels right.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t have the whole picture, I guess, if I had to put it into words?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cAlright.\\xa0 Then I\\u2019ll agree.\\xa0 You know this is on your head if this goes wrong, Sy?\\xa0 Not because I want it to be, but because-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI get it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI really do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll go cut the power,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I\\u2019ll follow Gordon\\u2019s lead.\\xa0 We need another victim to make this count.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait, what?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>Mary seemed to take the fact that we hadn\\u2019t told her no as a signal to go ahead.\\xa0 She pulled away from the huddle and darted off into the crowd.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cCut me.\\xa0 Give me claw marks, like Gordon has.\\xa0 You do have a scalpel.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not doing that,\\u201d Lillian hissed.\\xa0 \\u201cIbbot would kill me, and I\\u2019m supposed to put you back <em>together, </em>not <em>take you apart.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know how to cut people to minimize the damage, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHold on.\\xa0 Why not <em>me</em>?\\xa0 Why can\\u2019t I be the next victim?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause I\\u2019m a better actor,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd you\\u2019re more useful out there, than someone that\\u2019s being looked after.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to leave scars.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt will not, don\\u2019t be a silly-billy,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She laid a hand on the side of Lillian\\u2019s face.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019ll make me as good as new.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019ll hurt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt will,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI should do it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t feel pain the same way you all do,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI should still do it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe shut up?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m doing it,\\u201d Helen said, firmly.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is what I do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d\\xa0 I looked at Lillian.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAm I supposed to tell him no, too?\\xa0 Because I\\u2019d rather cut him,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd if Lil is more comfortable cutting me, she\\u2019ll cut cleaner, and it\\u2019ll be more believable-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie put a hand over my mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo it,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cNow.\\xa0 There\\u2019s no time.\\xa0 Or I\\u2019ll do it to myself, and it\\u2019ll be messy enough Ibott <em>will</em> be mad.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>Helen raised her thumbnail to her eye.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay?\\u201d Lillian said, sounding unsure.\\xa0 She drew a scalpel from a pocket.</p>\\n<p>I glanced back.\\xa0 The Shepherd had seemingly committed to silence.\\xa0 He was looking after Gordon.</p>\\n<p>People were getting organized, the situation was stable.\\xa0 He was apparently content to let that remain the case until the monster showed up or something happened.</p>\\n<p>I wanted so badly to make something happen.</p>\\n<p>Stampede would shake the box.\\xa0 Take us out of the comfort of the church, or spread people out.\\xa0 He would need to round up his flock, do <em>something</em>.\\xa0 I really wanted to see what that something was.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d let people get killed, freeing experiments to shake up the community.\\xa0 He was operating to specific ends, and a quiet dislike for the Academy was almost definitely a factor\\u2026 but that wasn\\u2019t the whole story.\\xa0 He was working toward something big, and I suspected that something big would get a lot of people killed.\\xa0 A small <em>war</em>.</p>\\n<p>Mary worked fast.\\xa0 Lillian was barely starting the second set of claw marks, Helen holding her hand and forcing her to keep moving it, while her fingers held the scalpel steady.\\xa0 The first set had been done across Helen\\u2019s shoulder and chest.\\xa0 This set was on Helen\\u2019s face, of all places.</p>\\n<p>She started to rise.\\xa0 I put my hand out, stopping her.\\xa0 I gestured for Lillian to continue.</p>\\n<p>The fear and panic were reaching a pitch, now.</p>\\n<p>I wondered what was going through the Shepherd\\u2019s mind.\\xa0 If he was thinking the Academy was after him, this was a bad sign, right here.</p>\\n<p>Lillian finished the third mark across Helen\\u2019s eyelid and cheekbone.\\xa0 Blood welled out.\\xa0 Helen smeared it, and grabbed her hair to muck it up.</p>\\n<p>I moved my hand away.\\xa0 Helen crawled out from under the table.</p>\\n<p>She took two steps toward the pews, then let out the most <em>perfect</em> blood-chilling scream I\\u2019d ever heard.</p>\\n<p>Then she threw herself into the little table with books on top.</p>\\n<p><em>So jealous</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re in the church!\\u201d I howled.\\xa0 \\u201cRun!\\xa0 Run!\\xa0 Run!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>People ran.\\xa0 The double doors were hauled open, which meant we didn\\u2019t get stuck in them.\\xa0 People fled into the rain and darkness.</p>\\n<p>A gunshot sounded.</p>\\n<p>I felt a thrill, more than anything else.</p>\\n<p>In the gloom of the church, lit only by candles, the Shepherd stepped forward.\\xa0 He held his rifle, the butt to his shoulder, barrel pointed at the roof.</p>\\n<p>Eyes turned to him.</p>\\n<p>He shrugged back his cloak, where his bad arm was covered.</p>\\n<p>As new arms went, it was horrendous.\\xa0 Even in the gloom, I could see how it had been rebuilt using fungus or wood, like so many ruined buildings were, but the flesh around the fungus was ragged and ugly, not quite adhering or holding in place.</p>\\n<p>He raised his arm, then gestured, a crisp right to left movement, one meaty, misshapen finger pointing.</p>\\n<p>Guns cocked.\\xa0 More than a few.\\xa0 More than just the ones he\\u2019d carried with him.</p>\\n<p>It explained his calm, all this while.\\xa0 From the start, he\\u2019d had soldiers in reserve.\\xa0 Hiding, maybe in the crowd, maybe in adjacent rooms.\\xa0 The weapons he was equipping his army with weren\\u2019t just improvised ones.</p>\\n<p>People had stopped in their tracks for the second time, standing in the rain.\\xa0 They watched him.</p>\\n<p>He advanced down the aisle, flanked by a dozen men with rifles, who were watching the crowd, looking out for monsters that weren\\u2019t there.</p>\\n<p>One had Lacey, holding her arms behind her back.</p>\\n<p>Believed to be an agent of the Academy.\\xa0 Not <em>wrong</em>, but not quite right, either.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy is coming,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re coming for <em>us</em>.\\xa0 It was always their plan, and I\\u2019ve been planning how to stop them for some time.\\xa0 I\\u2019m going to need all of you to listen <em>very carefully</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

babies both.\\xa0 It was a shock tactic, nothing more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The restlessness of the crowd was intense, but in the exchanged words, the glances out into the darkness, I didn\\u2019t make out much that seemed to be doubting the Shepherd\\u2019s words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe fear and confusion you\\u2019re experiencing right now is <em>theirs</em>.\\xa0 So is the anger, and the that deep seated feeling of frustration that there\\u2019s nothing you can do about it all.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve all heard it before.\\xa0 The Crown doesn\\u2019t lose wars.\\xa0 When they fight, they do it using monsters.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I\\u2019m almost offended</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey do it using people like <em>her</em>, who would put children in harm\\u2019s way for her goals,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>The man who had Lacey stepped forward.\\xa0 She struggled a bit before freezing.\\xa0 I assumed she felt a gun at her back.</p>\\n<p>He pointed back at where two of his soldiers were holding the injured Gordon.\\xa0 \\u201cTwo children have been harmed tonight.\\xa0 At least two more have been killed, earlier today.\\xa0 The Academy is walking a dangerous path, one that starts with claiming our dead for their work, then starts using us as pieces in their great machine.\\xa0 Lives are being lost.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He paused for dramatic effect.\\xa0 I wanted to signal Lacey to interrupt, break his stride, but she couldn\\u2019t see.\\xa0 Her head was bent down, red hair falling around her, and the silence belonged entirely to the Shepherd.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI kept in touch with old friends who fought in the war with me, the men you see standing behind and beside me.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry to have kept this secret from you, but we\\u2019ve lived the last decade working out means and methods of stopping the Academy from doing so much harm.\\xa0 We have been devising a <em>plan</em>.\\xa0 I do this out of <em>faith</em>, and I do it out of fear.\\xa0 Fear that if we do not act now, together, <em>decisively</em>, then they might give up the last gasps of decency.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Another pause.\\xa0 Lacey started to speak this time, but a hand covered her mouth, and she was pushed to her knees, held there by two firm hands on her shoulders.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you run out into the rain and darkness tonight, you will be running straight into their embrace,\\u201d the Shepherd spoke.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019ve used fear as a weapon for a century now, and they\\u2019ve gotten very good at it.\\xa0 Trust me, I\\u2019m not asking you to fight.\\xa0 I <em>am</em> asking you to take a stand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were murmurs, hesitation.\\xa0 He had them on the hook, but they weren\\u2019t caught by any means.\\xa0 Something told me that was intentional.\\xa0 Probably the vague tail-end of the statement.\\xa0 \\u2018Take a stand\\u2019, what did that mean?\\xa0 He\\u2019d leave them wondering, and then give them what they wanted.\\xa0 He probably did that a lot.\\xa0 It was why they were so well trained to <em>listen</em> to him.\\xa0 Oratory skills at work.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStand at our back, respond to fear not by pulling away, but by banding together.\\xa0 The Academy is built with flesh and blood as its foundation.\\xa0 With <em>people</em>.\\xa0 We have the power to dictate what we need, the boundaries we expect, and the lines that should not be crossed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>He\\u2019s been building toward this for some time</em>.\\xa0 <em>Seeds of doubt and concern, building on those doubts anyone might have when the world was actively changing.</em></p>\\n<p>With the heavy clouds and the later hour, it was dark enough that people were barely more than silhouettes, only illuminated where light reflected off the water that streamed off of them.\\xa0 The water was coming down hard enough that there was a definite weight to it, pushing every single one of us down, heads hunched over, shoulders bent in.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t mind it so much, as it was warm.\\xa0 My hood stayed down, and the rain washed through my hair and down my face.</p>\\n<p>I turned to move away.\\xa0 Small figures in the crowd joined me.\\xa0 With them, with my fellow Lambs, a few doubters found the courage to turn away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy is already making its moves!\\u201d the Shepherd called out.\\xa0 \\u201cThe monster the little boy described was not one of the escaped experiments that were described to us!\\xa0 It was a weapon the Academy uses, just as Dog and Catcher are.\\xa0 I saw enough of them when I was a soldier, and I know what they look like, what they do.\\xa0 My comrades know that the Academy and the Crown have no reservations about using those things on their own people, if they deem fit.\\xa0 Very soon, they\\u2019re going to act.\\xa0 They\\u2019re going to do something more to scare you, because they don\\u2019t want to see us united!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>The holy man makes a prophecy</em>, I noted.\\xa0 He did know how the academy operated, even if there was no way he could know that Cecil had run off to go call for help.\\xa0 He\\u2019d anticipated this move on our part, in a general way.</p>\\n<p>The other Lambs reached me.\\xa0 We were minus Helen and Gordon now.\\xa0 We stood off to the side of the road, huddled in the alcove by a door, where we could still peer out and watch the crowd.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Shepherd didn\\u2019t seem to notice that both of the cut up kids were from our group,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe noticed, at least with Gordon,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if he even saw Helen, though.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t acting for <em>his</em> benefit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere <em>is</em> Helen?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBack in the Church,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr making her exit by a side door.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Jamie said, very patiently.</p>\\n<p>I sensed doubt from her, and cut it off.\\xa0 \\u201cIf Jamie says he\\u2019s sure, then we go with that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I glanced over.\\xa0 By Jamie\\u2019s estimation and what I could verify with my own eyes, that put Gordon in the midst of the Shepherd\\u2019s group, while Helen had free range at the Shepherd\\u2019s flanks and rear, assuming nobody spotted her.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d have to make do with this.</p>\\n<p>A distance away, we could hear the crowd.\\xa0 A part of me very much wanted to hear every word the Shepherd was saying, but we had other issues.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I was doing my best to piece thoughts together.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Much as I hate to say, same trick won\\u2019t work again.\\xa0 Only so many times kids can get cut up and scream.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCondolences,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll manage somehow,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s too damn good at handling them.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t shake up the crowd without him calming them down, turning them into this tool he can use against the Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I\\u2019d managed to dose him, we\\u2019d be a lot further along,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd that woman-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLacey,\\u201d Lillian volunteered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe wouldn\\u2019t be under suspicion, probably, or be caught.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou care about that?\\u201d I asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNevermind,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>It\\u2019s a mark against your abilities more than anything else.\\xa0 \\u201c</em>Listen, nothing goes according to plan.\\xa0 Humans are weird.\\xa0 Trick is to adapt the plan.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe plan will work if you\\u2019re good enough,\\u201d Mary said, in a tone that made me think she was mimicking someone.\\xa0 I was guessing his name started with P and ended with -ercy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat so?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think so.\\xa0 You just have to work at being good enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell then,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s be good.\\xa0 Can\\u2019t shake the crowd.\\xa0 Would be great if we could get at the Shepherd, but I\\u2019m not sure how to do that.\\xa0 He surrounds himself with people.\\xa0 It would be awfully nice to have a riot happening when the Academy deigns to arrive.\\xa0 If it\\u2019s out of the Shepherd\\u2019s control but still within the Academy\\u2019s, then we\\u2019re good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf they arrive,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s the chance Cecil couldn\\u2019t get help, or people might not believe him, or <em>something</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Or Cecil could be dead</em>, I finished the thought in my head.\\xa0 I\\u2019d raised the idea earlier, and Lillian had reacted rather strongly to it.\\xa0 Didn\\u2019t bear bringing it up again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf they don\\u2019t arrive, we adapt,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I looked over to the crowd.\\xa0 \\u201cFor a holy man, he mentions <em>faith</em> a lot, but he doesn\\u2019t leave much up to it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>As if in answer to that, a horn sounded from within the crowd.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Ugh,</em>\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat <em>was</em> that?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA horn,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mary and Jamie hit me across the back of the head, with Mary being a step faster.</p>\\n<p>I winced, and added, \\u201cHe\\u2019s got other friends.\\xa0 Whatever he had planned tonight, he\\u2019s doing it.\\xa0 Calling in other groups.\\xa0 Calling in the Academy too, while he\\u2019s at it.\\xa0 Anyone looking for him knows exactly where to go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re out of time,\\u201d Mary said, looking in the opposite direction, down the street.\\xa0 \\u201cOnly a matter of minutes now before the Academy gets here, if that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy do this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe knows the Academy can\\u2019t just slaughter it\\u2019s people.\\xa0 Even with all the weapons they have at their disposal, the Academy can\\u2019t get everyone, and if they let some slip the net, then word spreads.\\xa0 It cripples Radham and it hurts the Crown as a whole.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProfessor Briggs was willing to,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think he would be, looking at this.\\xa0 The side that makes the first move loses.\\xa0 If there\\u2019s a riot, actively harming Radham, the Professor is justified.\\xa0 If the Academy moves first, the crowd is free to protect themselves and word can spread about the brutality of the Academy, how it hacks down its own people.\\xa0 We need to take down the man at the center of it all, and we need to do it <em>fast</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We headed back toward the crowd.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd was talking.\\xa0 \\u201c\\u2026years of infiltration, we quickly discovered that each of the major buildings had a special project.\\xa0 Dog and Catcher are but one of an <em>assortment</em>.\\xa0 In my time fighting in the war, I saw some of the ones from other Academies.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a pattern, almost always a pattern in how they operate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Willing to bet you\\u2019re wrong</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>You\\u2019ve got exceptions to the rule, like us</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe first and biggest one, one that convinced me I needed to rally the people, rally <em>you</em>, was the knowledge that with a small few exceptions, big and powerful weapons, the special projects and weapons the Academy uses are less effective against <em>groups</em>.\\xa0 In wartime, Dog and Catcher might attack supply lines, the Gorger might attack trains and coaches, or plow through regiments to attack leaders, Foster would bolster a group\\u2019s numbers, and the Whelps might scout.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Having difficulty when there were too many people around.</p>\\n<p>Okay, well, I was willing to cede this one to him.\\xa0 It <em>was</em> proving to be an obstacle.\\xa0 Couldn\\u2019t get to him without getting past all these people.</p>\\n<p>Another man spoke out, one of the Shepherd\\u2019s comrades in arms.\\xa0 That the Shepherd was deferring to him suggested that the group was being prepared for another kind of leadership entirely.\\xa0 \\u201cIn case of gas, anything airborne, anything you can smell or taste, hold your breath.\\xa0 One of my men is handing out cloths.\\xa0 Tie them over your noses and mouths.\\xa0 The fluids we put on them will help filter out the gases.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSmells like piss!\\u201d someone shouted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can use your own piss and a handkerchief if you prefer,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 He was wearing a raincoat, but his expression had a military cast to it, as if he\\u2019d held a grim and serious, staring-past-you expression for far too long, and his face was forever stuck that way.\\xa0 Something about him was very similar to the Shepherd.\\xa0 Disconnected, too calm given the situation.\\xa0 It was strangely compelling, because it seemed like something was missing, or he\\u2019d once been very lost, deep inside himself, and he\\u2019d come back having found something.</p>\\n<p>Most people didn\\u2019t manage that.\\xa0 Whatever didn\\u2019t kill us tended to leave us hurting, rather than making us stronger.\\xa0 But something had happened to the Shepherd\\u2019s regiment that left them harrowed, all the emotional or mental fat flensed away.\\xa0 Parasites?\\xa0 Psychadelics?\\xa0 A horror unlike any other, that they\\u2019d been forced to survive?</p>\\n<p>The soldier spoke, \\u201cThey\\u2019ll try to scare us with the Stitched.\\xa0 March them at us to make us retreat.\\xa0 We <em>must</em> hold the line.\\xa0 We have allies moving into position, they\\u2019ll break the ranks of the Stitched instead.\\xa0 <em>If</em> you have the courage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Allies moving into position.\\xa0 That\\u2019s who the Shepherd was signaling.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is fine to be afraid,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 \\u201cGod-fearing is praise for a reason.\\xa0 Fear makes everything clearer.\\xa0 But do not panic.\\xa0 This is the first momentous step among many to making it so that the Academy\\u2019s wrongs and mistakes no longer weigh on our minds.\\xa0 We do not build or change something without care.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Another horn sounded in the distance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy is coming,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re meant to be serving us, bettering mankind with great truths and brilliant discoveries.\\xa0 Instead, they crush us under their heels.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve felt it in your bones for a long time.\\xa0 Maybe you\\u2019ve felt it since the day you opened your eyes and looked at the world.\\xa0 Maybe you\\u2019ve wondered if it could be different.\\xa0 I\\u2019m promising you that it can.\\xa0 You get one chance, and this is it.\\xa0 Turn around.\\xa0 Be ready.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The soldiers were passing through the group.\\xa0 People were being handed weapons and the cloths.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t all match, like a proper military regiment.\\xa0 Many were improvised.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we do this right, if the Academy has any humanity at all, it shouldn\\u2019t come to a fight.\\xa0 Hold firm, defend yourselves if you must, but don\\u2019t act without need.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve made you afraid for a long time.\\xa0 Pay attention to that fear, make it yours again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were maybe two hundred people present.\\xa0 Maybe slightly more.\\xa0 Each stood in the rain, gripping the weapons they\\u2019d been given.\\xa0 There was silence.</p>\\n<p>There was going to be blood.\\xa0 A lot of these people were going to be hurt, if not outright killed.</p>\\n<p><em>You\\u2019re all sheep.\\xa0 You were the Academy\\u2019s sheep before, and now you\\u2019re his.</em></p>\\n<p>I needed to get close.\\xa0 Close enough to say one or two things to the Shepherd.</p>\\n<p>I turned away, pushing through the crowd, every individual of which was now facing away from the church.\\xa0 People didn\\u2019t get out of my way, and some even tried to stop me, <em>still</em> me, and make me conform.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy,\\u201d a man said.</p>\\n<p>I stopped.\\xa0 <em>No</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne coach?\\u201d another man asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI recognize the coach,\\u201d Jamie said, a few feet away.\\xa0 Then he piped up, \\u201cTeacher!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Cecil.</p>\\n<p>Jamie wasn\\u2019t fast to move when the situation called for it, but he wasn\\u2019t able to move very fast while he worked his way back out of the crowd, anyway.\\xa0 I looked over my shoulder and saw him sprinting across the empty space between the crowd and the coach.</p>\\n<p>Jamie had a plan.</p>\\n<p>I needed to do something.\\xa0 To stall, to execute, to buy time.</p>\\n<p>Being small had its disadvantages.\\xa0 As easy as it was to move around, I struggled to make headway through a mass of bodies, people who\\u2019d been asked and ordered to stand resolute.\\xa0 People who collectively smelled like piss.</p>\\n<p>I reached the perimeter of men that were around the Shepherd.\\xa0 Hands seized me, stopping me.</p>\\n<p>A moment later, one hand was off me, then another.\\xa0 I heard a man cry in pain, saw him twisting his arm and hand in a weird way, and realized that a small hand had a grip on it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou leave him alone!\\u201d Mary shouted.</p>\\n<p>Mary was with me, facilitating.</p>\\n<p>I broke past the soldiers, stepping into the space between the Shepherd and the crowd.\\xa0 There wasn\\u2019t much of an audience like this.\\xa0 People might hear my voice, but they wouldn\\u2019t see me.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Helen had enjoyed their moments in the spotlight.\\xa0 I wanted mine, damn it.</p>\\n<p>I found a short wall, dodged one soldier\\u2019s reaching hand, and hopped up onto it, grabbing an overhanging tree branch for balance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou never believed in God, did you?\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>With the crowd so quiet and expectant, the words rang out.\\xa0 Heads turned.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd was silent.</p>\\n<p>It was a powerful tactic in arguments, especially when one had the position of power.\\xa0 Let another person make their arguments, exhausting themselves, then shut it down, one decisive blow.</p>\\n<p>Which meant I had to make as strong an argument as I could.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou just want to manipulate us!\\u201d I cried out.\\xa0 \\u201cYou chose a job that would mean we <em>listened</em> to you, you <em>used</em> us, you <em>lied</em> to us!\\xa0 You never told us any of this!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Problem was, I had to make my argument while sounding like a child.\\xa0 Could I call this Emperor out on his new clothes?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou didn\\u2019t give any proof that she did anything, you only needed a- a <em>scapegoat</em>!\\xa0 Why are you hurting my teacher, Reverend Mauer!?\\xa0 Why!?\\xa0 She\\u2019s nice!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>On the other side of the crowd from the Reverend, I saw Cecil do the saddest, stiffest, \\u2018lift the child up by the armpits and whirl them around\\u2019 act that I\\u2019d ever seen.\\xa0 Jamie must have asked him, to play into whatever Jamie\\u2019s plan was.</p>\\n<p>The two of them stepped into the shelter the coach offered, talking.\\xa0 Again, very stiff, the doctor reached out to touch Jamie\\u2019s head.</p>\\n<p>With Cecil so close, I had to do what I could to disarm the Shepherd on that score.\\xa0 Defending Lacey or forcing him to argue in her favor would play into that.</p>\\n<p>While I was dividing my focus between the Shepherd and Cecil, a soldier grabbed for me.\\xa0 With me up on the wall, and Mary so low to the ground, she wasn\\u2019t able to stop him or interfere.\\xa0 Not without doing anything fancy.</p>\\n<p>He lifted me down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHush, boy,\\u201d he said, gruff.\\xa0 \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t the time for that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s like he said,\\u201d I said, louder than was polite or socially acceptable.\\xa0 The benefit of being young.\\xa0 \\u201cIf not <em>now</em>, then <em>when</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s fine,\\u201d the Shepherd said.\\xa0 He gave me a hard look, and I <em>knew</em> that he was suspicious now.\\xa0 He hadn\\u2019t missed seeing Jamie and Cecil either.\\xa0 Between Gordon, Jamie, Mary and I, we were doing too much to work against his ends.\\xa0 \\u201cSid, I want you to listen, and hear how much I mean it.\\xa0 I wouldn\\u2019t be doing any of this if I didn\\u2019t truly <em>believe</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t sound like you mean it much at all!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do.\\xa0 You\\u2019re scared, and you\\u2019re hearing only what you want to hear.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think any regular member of my congregation has any doubt how much I believe, or how much I care for their welfare.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was a cheap, dirty tactic, and it was a cheap, dirty tactic that worked.\\xa0 Retreat to the unassailable position.\\xa0 An argument so vague and seemingly from-the-heart that it couldn\\u2019t be taken to pieces.\\xa0 Emotion-based arguments were annoying like that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour teacher used your friend,\\u201d he said, in that same calm voice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe was with you and me the whole time!\\xa0 You saw!\\xa0 Why are you lying!?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I had so many listening ears, I was changing minds incrementally, instilling doubt where there had only been loyalty, and I was taking all the joy I felt in the moment and translating it into a kind of outrage, more emotion to feed into my words, <em>accusing</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI-\\u201d he started.\\xa0 He paused, his head turning.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t see through the crowd to follow his line of sight.</p>\\n<p>The soldier that was holding on to my wrist turned to look, and I chose that moment to pull myself free.\\xa0 I danced back and hopped back onto the wall.\\xa0 He reached for me, and I ducked back.\\xa0 The same branches I\\u2019d held onto before poked at his face and shoulder, almost invisible in the darkness.</p>\\n<p>It was Cecil, approaching the crowd, Jamie a step behind.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome!\\u201d the Shepherd called out.\\xa0 \\u201cOver here, let\\u2019s talk!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Cecil started forward.\\xa0 Jamie held firm onto his hand, keeping him from following the offer.\\xa0 The Doctor paused, then shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m not talking to you, I\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were in my Church earlier.\\xa0 Before the boy was hurt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Working on tying him to Lacey</em>.\\xa0 But my defense of Lacey and the show of familiarity with Jamie gave Cecil a kind of protection.\\xa0 The Shepherd would look unreasonable before his flock if he wasn\\u2019t careful.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not- no,\\u201d Cecil said.\\xa0 He bowed his head.\\xa0 He seemed to compose himself.\\xa0 \\u201cThere were more riots.\\xa0 Men, boys and women from other areas got hurt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf there were more riots, we would have heard more horns,\\u201d the Shepherd said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI

hostility, the strangeness of it.\\xa0 But the terror seemed to work for him.\\xa0 It gave him an authenticity that he might not have had if he were speaking in monotone.</p>\\n<p>He fumbled for a paper, unfolding it.\\xa0 \\u201cL\\u2026 J.J. Bridges.\\xa0 K. Downs.\\xa0 I- I can\\u2019t read in the dark, with this rain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A man broke rank, stepping forward to raise his cloak up over Cecil\\u2019s head.\\xa0 A lighter glowed, illuminating the paper.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cR. Hartman.\\xa0 D. Estrada.\\xa0 M. Mayes.\\xa0 D. Thomas\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>With every other name, there were noises from the crowd.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat happened!?\\u201d a man cried out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI just know that they were hurt or killed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe full name.\\xa0 Was that Doug Thomas!?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know the full names,\\u201d Cecil said, and in his fear, his voice was small and hollow, almost powerless.</p>\\n<p>My eye fell on Jamie.</p>\\n<p>We all saw so many people over the course of the day.\\xa0 We heard names.</p>\\n<p>Jamie knew names, he knew faces.\\xa0 He\\u2019d actively gone looking for them, in quiet moments, had listened for them.\\xa0 He\\u2019d asked questions over the years.\\xa0 He\\u2019d pieced together a mental picture.</p>\\n<p>Not complete, I was sure, but he knew important people and he knew who their children were.\\xa0 The faces that weren\\u2019t in the crowd.</p>\\n<p>Jamie just stood there, rain streaming off his glasses and rain-cloak, having served as the harbinger of the worst kind of news anyone with a family could get.</p>\\n<p>A restlessness grew within the crowd.\\xa0 These were people they cared about, people neighbors cared about.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCalm down!\\u201d the Shepherd called out.\\xa0 \\u201cNothing is proven, nothing is certain!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>But the crowd was beyond the point of listening.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you react to this, you\\u2019ll be doing exactly what they want!\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>But there was no response.\\xa0 He was shouting at a force of nature, now.\\xa0 He knew it.</p>\\n<p>The crowd made a noise.\\xa0 A growing roar.</p>\\n<p>They had an enemy.</p>\\n<p>The Academy was here.</p>\\n<p>Guns fired, where people in the crowd had been given such.\\xa0 Too early, shooting at the wrong targets.</p>\\n<p>A formation of stitched, twenty-strong, each in uniform.</p>\\n<p>People broke rank, hurried to grab things they could throw at the Academy\\u2019s beasts.</p>\\n<p>We had our riot.</p>\\n<p>We also had a problem.</p>\\n<p>In this scenario Jamie had painted, the Academy had made the first move.\\xa0 It helped that people would go home and find their loved ones safe and sound.\\xa0 But if we couldn\\u2019t correct the interpretation, things would go sour.\\xa0 Hayle would be upset with me, because this wouldn\\u2019t be a perfect execution.</p>\\n<p>We had a <em>second</em> issue, now that I thought about it, figuring out where things stood.\\xa0 The Shepherd was one to position himself carefully, so any piece that we took was well defended.\\xa0 That made me think about his <em>men, </em>and thinking about his men made me think about the fact that he now knew that we were working against him.\\xa0 His flock was scattered, turned into something wasteful, soon to be shut down, and he had nothing to stop him from dwelling on <em>us</em>.</p>\\n<p>He met my eyes, and there was something there I hadn\\u2019t seen before.</p>\\n<p>He was <em>looking</em> at me.\\xa0 Not as a child, or a member of his flock, but as the person on the other side of the chess board.\\xa0 Or one of them, anyway.\\xa0 He knew what we were, or he had an idea, now.</p>\\n<p>I gave him a smile.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/12/08/bleeding-edge-8-1/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Mary</strong></p>\\n<p>Four nobles.\\xa0 Augmented physiology, augmented minds.\\xa0 They were, as Mr. Percy would have said, \\u2018<em>top notch</em>\\u2018.\\xa0 Absolute monsters.\\xa0 Depending on what unfolded, the Lambs might find themselves in a fight by the day\\u2019s end.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t a situation the Lambs would survive.</p>\\n<p>She had to trust Sy and Gordon to figure out if there was a way out, and handle her part of the questioning as well as she could.\\xa0 What she <em>could</em> figure out was a way to make things easier.\\xa0 If they were called in, the girls were likely to be called in first.\\xa0 Helen first of all, the appointment was already made, then Mary herself, very possibly, or Lillian or <em>may</em><em>be</em> Sylvester, but Mary was likely.</p>\\n<p>The professors and assistants in the hallway were blocking Mary\\u2019s view of the rest of the group, while Gordon was inside, giving his answers.\\xa0 She could only stare out the window, at the people, or gaze at the floor while she worked out a strategy.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Percy had always encouraged \\u2018mental practice\\u2019.\\xa0 Picturing where her body would be, the motions she would make, the weight of things, and all the details, sometimes over and over, before she acted.\\xa0 Then she would act, perform more mental practices, adjusting for how things had felt, and the loop would continue until the actions and process were distilled in her mind\\u2019s eye.</p>\\n<p>Helen would probably die, if she was first.\\xa0 If Sylvester or Lillian were second, then they would die next.\\xa0 That would hurt more.\\xa0 She cared about Helen, but Lillian was her best friend,\\xa0 worth killing Percy for.\\xa0 Sylvester was important to her for different reasons.</p>\\n<p>She had to steel herself for that.\\xa0 Prepare herself by putting the emotions aside, lock them away.\\xa0 If she was going to use them, it had to be in rage or in desperation, a forward push to get past any pain or bodily harm she might feel, past poisons or drugs or whatever else they might do to her.</p>\\n<p>The Twins were torturers with a retinue of doctors and madmen who catered to their whims.\\xa0 The bodies might well be on display.\\xa0 What was left of them, if they were lucky enough to be dead.</p>\\n<p>Mary felt cold inside, hollowed out, but she was able to drive out the feelings of fear and panic.\\xa0 Those were useless, dangerous feelings, ones that robbed her of precision and control.</p>\\n<p>She had to prepare, be ready.</p>\\n<p>The Nobles were tall.\\xa0 They liked that, being above the common people.\\xa0 Mary was far from full grown, with a three-quarter foot to grow, if she compared herself to the woman who was supposed to be her mother.\\xa0 The legs would be her best target.</p>\\n<p>But that wasn\\u2019t the whole story.\\xa0 The jackets the Duke and Baron had been wearing were heavy, and they flowed oddly as they walked.\\xa0 There was something in them, armor.</p>\\n<p>She had to attack from the front, knowing that the one she chose as her target was quicker, faster, and very aware of what was going on around them.</p>\\n<p>Best to attack while her back was turned.\\xa0 Use her head to distract and drive one foot back and up, to target the knee.\\xa0 If she could topple one, then she could target the neck.</p>\\n<p>Easiest to do if she had a knife, but she suspected she would be searched.\\xa0 They knew her methods too well.</p>\\n<p>There was a disposable scalpel razor in the lining of her coat, and another blade in the tongue of her shoe.\\xa0 Small enough she could put them up her nasal cavity or in her mouth.\\xa0 The nose meant a risk of bleeding if she slipped, but she\\u2019d done it before.\\xa0 The mouth, hm, they would search her mouth if they had any sense at all, but she suspected she could embed the blade in the flesh behind the last molar, pointing toward her throat.\\xa0 Easy to miss if the lighting was wrong, and she could swallow the blood.\\xa0 If she threw up from that, then so much the better, it only gave her more opportunities.</p>\\n<p>Maybe both.</p>\\n<p>Topple her enemy, target the spine.\\xa0 She tried to picture the scenarios unfolding.</p>\\n<p>Not the throat or the jugular, unless she could do that as part of something else.\\xa0 The spine was a better target.\\xa0 Cervical four, third bundle was a likely target, but would only shut off breathing, freezing the diaphragm.\\xa0 She would get pulled away, the doctors would swoop in.\\xa0 They would fix the noble in the time it took them to die from a lack of breath.\\xa0 Depending on how their bodies had been changed, that could be a very long time.</p>\\n<p>Thoracics one through four had places she could drive a blade in to shut off the heart, lungs, and larynx.\\xa0 Drive in the blade, do as much damage as possible, shut off heart function or ability to breathe.\\xa0 Hard to do if the back was armored and protected, if the twins might have open backed dresses, or she could reach in past the collar.\\xa0 It was worth keeping in mind, reciting that play in her head as a possibility.</p>\\n<p>If she could drive the blade in, knowing how small it was, then it would be harder to fix, the damage more severe.\\xa0 It would require something harder than any one part of her body.\\xa0 Something from the environment.</p>\\n<p>She could do it if her hands were bound, it would be harder but possible.\\xa0 But being restrained was the least of her concerns, as she imagined different factors.\\xa0 They might not fall, even as she leveraged a kick that could break ordinary bone into one of the more vulnerable parts of the human body.\\xa0 Their spine might be protected.\\xa0 She might not be able to access and keep a blade.\\xa0 Her hands might even be bound, which wouldn\\u2019t stop her, but it could cost her the time she needed to grab the blade and follow through.</p>\\n<p>She would die.\\xa0 That bothered her less than the cold hollow emptiness that Helen had articulated so well, the loneliness that took hold inside her even now at <em>imagining</em> Helen\\u2019s dead eyes staring off into space, or Lillian in horrible pain.</p>\\n<p>She would die, but even if she <em>tried</em>, if she was clever about it, the nobles who remained might think twice about giving personal attention to the Lambs who remained.\\xa0 If they deferred to another method of execution or torture, then the remaining Lambs might have a chance to escape that they wouldn\\u2019t have with the nobles.</p>\\n<p>It was a chance, however slim.</p>\\n<p>Hope for the best, trust the Lambs, anticipate the worst.\\xa0 She and her knives as the final measure to turn to when the talking and strategy drew to a close.</p>\\n<p>So often, her way of showing her affection for others meant killing people.\\xa0 For Percy, it was always the plan.\\xa0 For Lillian, she\\u2019d killed Percy.\\xa0 Now she might have to kill a noble, a possibility few even dared to contemplate.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs were too important to her.</p>\\n<p>She could see glimpses of Helen through the crowd.\\xa0 Helen seemed utterly at ease, but she didn\\u2019t broadcast her feelings like others did.\\xa0 She could see the sort of situation that Mary had imagined earlier, the Lambs dead or mutilated, and smile and act like nothing was wrong.</p>\\n<p>Mary liked to think that even if Helen smiled and acted normal, she would seek revenge if it came down to it.\\xa0 She had spent a lot of time stressing out about Helen, until months of close proximity and sharing a room had forced her to come to terms with her feelings.\\xa0 Helen was a lot easier to understand as a creature when Mary stopped looking at her as a human, and more as a reptile or a cat.</p>\\n<p>Even cats and snakes had a measure of loyalty.</p>\\n<p>That made her think of Lillian.</p>\\n<p>Mary had never had a friend.\\xa0 The depth of her feelings for Lillian spooked her, sometimes, sometimes on par with her early feelings for Sylvester, in a very different way.\\xa0 Sylvester had been like a leap over a gap between rooftops, dangerous, uncertain even when she was fully aware of her own ability.\\xa0 She <em>knew</em> he was a manipulator and liar, and that had made him interesting.</p>\\n<p>It still did.\\xa0 More than any of the Lambs, the little things and the patterns of Sylvester promised to complete her.\\xa0 They were in step, he could carry out a plan and she didn\\u2019t feel uncertain.\\xa0 When she faltered, he was there.\\xa0 When he faltered, she knew she had the opportunity to shine.\\xa0 It was rare for her to experience the concern about Sylvester\\u2019s plans that Gordon so often commented on.</p>\\n<p>She had spent a long time feeling very incomplete, as if she was working hard to fill a void with Percy\\u2019s approval, and someone who conformed to her as easily as Sylvester seemed to do was tempting.</p>\\n<p>But it had always felt dangerous.\\xa0 Always promised betrayal down the line.\\xa0 Idly, she had sometimes wondered how she would kill him if it came down to it, because she couldn\\u2019t entirely convince herself that it wouldn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Even as her trust in him approached that ninety-nine point seven or ninety-nine point eight percent, she had harbored faint doubts.\\xa0 That was who he was.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was a better, safer match.\\xa0 They were similar, the academic and the assassin, both dedicated to their individual crafts.\\xa0 With Lillian, she didn\\u2019t feel that heady sense of invincibility.\\xa0 With Lillian, she felt like a <em>girl</em>.</p>\\n<p>Whatever that was.</p>\\n<p>And <em>to</em> Lillian, she imagined, she <em>was</em> a girl, a friend.\\xa0 Lillian lacked guile enough to lie about that.\\xa0 She could share everything with Lillian.\\xa0 Even talk about Percy without feeling like she was betraying the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>Hearing Lillian speak about Percy and Lillian\\u2019s horror over what Percy had been doing had scared Mary more than any number of monsters or guns.\\xa0 It had led her to make a decision.</p>\\n<p>And Gordon.\\xa0 Gordon was the best of both worlds.\\xa0 She knew it, she just wasn\\u2019t sure if she felt it.\\xa0 Imagining kissing him made her heart pound, as did thoughts of feeling his hands around hers.\\xa0 She\\u2019d drawn nearer and nearer to him, testing the waters, waiting for him to reject her, waiting for the feelings she had to clarify.\\xa0 She just wasn\\u2019t sure if she truly liked him, or if it was only that her feelings for the other Lambs were so poignant and confused by other things going on in her head and her heart that he paled a shade in comparison.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was her only friend ever, and filled that hole in Mary\\u2019s breast that even Percy hadn\\u2019t been able to promise to fill.\\xa0 Sylvester was Mary\\u2019s counterpart.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was\\u2026 what?\\xa0 He promised to be the only thing that wasn\\u2019t mixed in with those complicated other thoughts.\\xa0 He understood her, he was a little bit dangerous, he made her feel like a proper <em>girl</em>.\\xa0 The thought of him dying made her think in all seriousness that she might react like Sy had to Jamie, and that somehow made her more anxious than the idea of losing all of the Lambs together, or any of the Lambs individually.</p>\\n<p>Because it felt most real and imminent, she told herself.</p>\\n<p>Was that love, fledgling love or otherwise?</p>\\n<p>The door opened.\\xa0 Mary looked up, just in time to see Hubris running ahead, zig-zagging.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHubris!\\u201d Gordon called.\\xa0 He changed the pitch of his voice, apparently annoyed, \\u201cHubris!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hubris made his way across the hallway, in Sylvester\\u2019s direction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHubris, come!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hubris looked back, pausing, then changed direction.\\xa0 The dog moved through the crowd of doctors and guards, making a beeline toward Mary.\\xa0 Sitting on the floor with her back to the wall, she couldn\\u2019t get up and move in time to get out of Hubris\\u2019 way.\\xa0 He pressed his face against hers, licking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood boy,\\u201d Mary said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGet your dog under control,\\u201d one of the doctors said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo tricks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon sounded exasperated as he explained, \\u201cHe\\u2019s worried.\\xa0 The people inside can tell you, I informed them at the start of the questioning, and several times throughout, my heart is acting up.\\xa0 He\\u2019s trained to tell me when there are problems, which is why he kept nudging me, and when I won\\u2019t or can\\u2019t listen, he\\u2019s trained to tell the other Lambs.\\xa0 My doctors are here.\\xa0 They can tell you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hubris whined.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t train him for that last part.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou didn\\u2019t, I did.\\xa0 It\\u2019s what he\\u2019s <em>for</em>,\\u201d Gordon said, patiently.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnough,\\u201d another doctor said.\\xa0 \\u201cWho\\u2019s next?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A man Mary couldn\\u2019t see spoke.\\xa0 \\u201cMary Cobourn.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary didn\\u2019t move at first, and Hubris leaned forward to lick her again.\\xa0 She imagined the actions she would need to take to attack the key targets here.\\xa0 Soldiers, key doctors, and people that stood in the way.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t as simple as it might have seemed on the surface.\\xa0 Crossing the hallway to get to Gordon or Sylvester could open up possibilities, in having more fighting strength and having more problem solving ability, but it was more distance to cover, and the Lambs needed to get to the other end of the hallway.</p>\\n<p>Her hands gripped Hubris\\u2019 collar, and she found a roll of paper slipped into the fold of the collar.\\xa0\\xa0 Moving her hands suggested there were two more.</p>\\n<p>No time to read it.</p>\\n<p>She pushed Hubris off her, and stood.</p>\\n<p>Mary offered Lillian a reassuring smile.\\xa0 Head up, chin high, back straight.\\xa0 Hubris hadn\\u2019t made it to Lillian, so Lillian lacked the small reassurance the piece of paper provided.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was being led the opposite way, leaving for his appointment.\\xa0 Mary watched him as they approached one another, each mostly surrounded by soldiers and scholars.</p>\\n<p>She met his eyes.\\xa0 They were warm, the colors not entirely matched between the two \\u2013 something she had only noticed after over a year of paying attention to him.\\xa0 On a dark, gloomy day,\\xa0 there wasn\\u2019t enough light to distinguish between them, but on a brighter day, when the light filtered in through the window, one eye was more chestnut than hazel, with flecks of gold.</p>\\n<p>A nod would be a giveaway.</p>\\n<p>She looked away, and her hands smoothed down the front of her top and her skirt, then went up to her collar, fixing it.\\xa0 She resisted the urge to let the hands linger a moment too long.\\xa0 He would understand.\\xa0 He knew her habits and mannerisms.</p>\\n<p>He had managed to direct, even without obvious cues.\\xa0 She suspected a hand signal, then tones of voice to change Hubris\\u2019 direction.\\xa0 It was possible there was another mechanism.\\xa0 She would ask later, given the chance.</p>\\n<p>For now, knowing there were options if they needed to fight their way out was reassuring.\\xa0 Knowing Gordon was thinking and working to help was reassuring.</p>\\n<p>Sy had been silent since stepping out of the room.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t starting anything, hadn\\u2019t made any comments.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t mean nothing was wrong.\\xa0 He could be biding his time, instead of working to signal the rest of the Lambs about the problems.</p>\\n<p>For now figuring out the right moment to read the note and answering the questions was the best thing she could do.\\xa0 If it went badly, she would turn her thoughts toward making sure the small blades were in place should she need them to kill a noble of the Crown.</p>\\n<p>One chair faced a table.\\xa0 Ten people sat around the sides and back of that table.</p>\\n<p>Headmaster Travers, Professor Hayle, Professor Ibott, and several other prominent professors sat around the table.\\xa0 So many had been pulled away during the war, and the table was mostly empty now.</p>\\n<p>The doors slammed shut behind her.</p>\\n<p><em>I have already figured out how to kill all of you if necessary</em>, Mary told herself.</p>\\n<p>She relaxed.</p>\\n<p><em>I am a young lady of Mothmont.\\xa0 I am a skilled killer.\\xa0 I am a step above.\\xa0 I can handle this, and with the Lambs at my back and sufficient preparation, I can handle anything this world might throw at me.</em></p>\\n<p>She smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell us,\\u201d Travers spoke, \\u201cWhat did the Lambs do wrong?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She kept the smile from faltering.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou failed in your duties, you let Genevieve Fray get away.\\xa0 Obviously the Lambs weren\\u2019t perfect.\\xa0 What happened?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary estimated what the people of the room could see, and scooted her chair forward a fraction.\\xa0 They wouldn\\u2019t be able to see over the table.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay right there, please.\\xa0 We know what you\\u2019re capable of-\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>You don\\u2019t know the half of it.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd we\\u2019d just as rather you stay where you are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 With one hand, she unrolled the paper at her knee.\\xa0 She dropped her eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u2018Y syG Y gW Y\\u2019\\xa0 The \\u2018y\\u2019 had a curve to the upper prongs.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t familiar with the shorthand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary raised her head.\\xa0 She thought through the possibilities as her mouth opened, and said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t like to badmouth the other Lambs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you can\\u2019t critically assess their performance then there might be deeper problems,\\u201d one of the doctors said.\\xa0 \\u201cIn which case we might want to consider sacrificing them for the greater good of Radham.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Sacrifice.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo save your own hide, you mean?\\u201d another Professor spoke.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCalm down,\\u201d Hayle cut in.\\xa0 \\u201cYou were saying, Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary remembered the hand sign for sacrifice.\\xa0 Thumb folded in, fingers curled forward.\\xa0 It was the thought that connected to the paper Gordon had given her.\\xa0 The letter G.\\xa0 It meant to sacrifice, a pawn, to put something at risk for greater reward, a

strategy.</p>\\n<p><em>Gordon\\u2019s plan.\\xa0 Scapegoat Sy?\\xa0 This is a</em> trick.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy was struggling,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStruggling?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe thing with Jamie, it threw him off, emotionally.\\xa0 He was adapting how he operated, trying to compensate for the lack of Jamie, and he was stressing about Jamie coming.\\xa0 When Jamie did come, later on, it was a distraction.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSending Jamie was our decision.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re trying to shift the blame-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary hurried to answer.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 Not at all.\\xa0 There were other problems.\\xa0 Sylvester made other mistakes.\\xa0 It stemmed from similar things, but also, you know he operates best when things are fresh in his mind, and if he picks up something new he forgets other things, or it slips away from him.\\xa0 We were months out of practice, the situation escalated too fast, and Sylvester was spread too thin to compensate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see,\\u201d the headmaster said.\\xa0 He looked frustrated.</p>\\n<p>It dawned on her why.</p>\\n<p>Sy had an <em>excuse</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk about Percy\\u2026\\u201d another Doctor said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow did you encounter him?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe got access to the building he and Fray were holed up in,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 Best to tell the truth when she wasn\\u2019t sure.\\xa0 Lie only when it counted.\\xa0 \\u201cFray let us walk in.\\xa0 Sy said she would, we believed him.\\xa0 Percy was one reason it worked.\\xa0 He was attached to me, still, and didn\\u2019t want me to come to harm.\\xa0 If someone had, it would have hurt their alliance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell us more about what you understood of Fray\\u2019s reasons.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Helen</strong></p>\\n<p>\\u201cHer reasons?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI look at faces,\\u201d Helen said, narrowing her eyes as she looked at the headmaster.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m a very good student of faces.\\xa0 I had to learn it all from the beginning, like Ashton is doing now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe know this,\\u201d Professor Ibott said.\\xa0 His face was <em>annoyed</em>.\\xa0 She would probably get talked at in a mean way when this was over.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis information might help for our replacement hires that aren\\u2019t familiar with the Lambs,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cGo on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI saw things in her face.\\xa0 What Sy said, she wants to be right.\\xa0 She has a mission and nothing\\u2019s going to shake her from that mission.\\xa0 But she\\u2019s very insecure deep down.\\xa0 She was <em>really</em> insecure when we ran into her.\\xa0 Sy did a lot of that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Ibott said.\\xa0 \\u201cUse his full name like a grown up girl.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExplain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe lost Cynthia, that was because of us too, I think.\\xa0 Cynthia didn\\u2019t like us being there, and she wasn\\u2019t happy being there to start with.\\xa0 And there was something about her not liking not being on top if Fray\\u2019s plan works and the Crown loses their grip on the West Crown States.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBe sure,\\u201d Ibott said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t the time or place for suppositions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t listening,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe others can tell you.\\xa0 I was focused on the room, making sure to listen to other things that were being said.\\xa0 I\\u2019m still not used to my new ears, but I wanted to make sure we weren\\u2019t attacked.\\xa0 There were a lot of dangerous people there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not good enough,\\u201d Ibott said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt will have to be,\\u201d Helen said, firmly.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Lambs work like a puzzle does.\\xa0 The pieces fit together one way.\\xa0 I\\u2019m a piece that does certain things.\\xa0 What I do is I watch.\\xa0 Especially when Jamie isn\\u2019t around.\\xa0 I wait, I look for opportunities to attack, and I use my ears better than anyone in the group.\\xa0 They all had their ears pointed one way, and I had my ears pointed the rest of the ways.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou need to keep track of what\\u2019s happening,\\u201d Ibott said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cLike I said, I kept enough track to know that Cynthia didn\\u2019t like it if everyone got those books and she wasn\\u2019t special for knowing stuff anymore.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was upset.\\xa0 She knew that.\\xa0 She knew how to act to make him more upset, and she knew how to act to make him less upset.\\xa0 She was less certain about why he was upset.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d known him longer than she had known anyone, and she still didn\\u2019t understand him a lot of the time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing she\\u2019s saying is contradicting what we heard from other Lambs,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s <em>how</em> she\\u2019s saying it,\\u201d Ibott said.</p>\\n<p>Oh.</p>\\n<p>Helen knew how to fix that.</p>\\n<p>She straightened her back, folding her hands in her lap.\\xa0 All of the right expressions and postures were very well organized in her head.\\xa0 She put the other ones away and brought these ones out.\\xa0 The tones of voice, the ways it affected how people treated her, it was a big, elaborate, spider\\u2019s web of a puzzle she had long ago figured out.</p>\\n<p>The trick to that puzzle was that everyone wanted something.\\xa0 Sy was good at making people want different things, or taking what they wanted and using it to make them do what he wanted them to do.\\xa0 Gordon wasn\\u2019t as clever about it, but could figure out what people <em>didn\\u2019t</em> want and hammer at that weak point until they gave.\\xa0 Even if it meant being troublesome to the point that they just wanted him to go away or told him what he wanted to know just to make him stop.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t get to do it much.</p>\\n<p>Helen could figure out what people wanted and <em>be</em> that.</p>\\n<p>The doctors and professors were conferring among themselves in whispers.\\xa0 There were parts of their voices that sounded too sharp, where her ears hadn\\u2019t quite adjusted to the very high pitches that voices could reach, that normal ears didn\\u2019t always catch.</p>\\n<p>She couldn\\u2019t hear all of it, but she could put the pieces together from one word in five that was being said.\\xa0 They were talking about focus.\\xa0 Priority number one was to verify if the Lambs were traitors.\\xa0 For some, the word \\u2018if\\u2019 was replaced with \\u2018that\\u2019.\\xa0 Verifying <em>that</em> the Lambs were traitors, as if it had already been decided.</p>\\n<p>All of her attention was going towards the act, reading expressions, paying attention to the glances that were cast her way and the faces people wore both when they did the glancing and after the fact.</p>\\n<p>Many parts of her brain were built around this kind of thinking and attention-paying.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid the Lambs at any point split up?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d Helen said, voice crisper than before, but musical enough to be pleasing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe night before last.\\xa0 Sylvester suggested we split up.\\xa0 Then he went after Fray.\\xa0 He was in there for a time, then he came out.\\xa0 That was how he knew we could get close enough to Fray to figure out what she was planning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re talking differently,\\u201d Professor Ibott observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh,\\u201d the Headmaster shushed the man.\\xa0 \\u201cIs it not possible that Sylvester could have acted against the Academy during this time, collaborating with Fray?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, sir,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe was acting funny.\\xa0 We had an argument about it after.\\xa0 He was acting different, hurrying things along, and making small mistakes.\\xa0 I said, and I said this to everybody, he was trying to replace Jamie.\\xa0 Not on purpose, exactly, but subconsciously.\\xa0 He was too sloppy to do the sort of thing you were talking about.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis role you\\u2019re putting on,\\u201d Professor Ibott said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s different from the infantile, \\u2018cute\\u2019 behavior before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was a role I put on for the Lambs, creator,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey were worried and anxious ever since our first meeting with Genevieve Fray.\\xa0 I tried to inject humor and positivity into things.\\xa0 I was more open about the thoughts that regularly cross my mind, but in a way I thought they could accept.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll cease that immediately,\\u201d Professor Ibott told her.</p>\\n<p>Helen tilted her head a little to one side.\\xa0 \\u201cI already have.\\xa0 You said you didn\\u2019t like <em>how</em> I was talking before, Professor.\\xa0 I adjusted my behavior to match this room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll cease that too.\\xa0 Present yourself to the room as you are, without the act.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen nodded.</p>\\n<p>All of the details went away, the facial expressions, the considerations, the balances and her judgments of people around her.\\xa0 Her expression faded, until she was only staring.</p>\\n<p>She looked at each of the people around the table, assessing them.</p>\\n<p>Ibott spoke, and he sounded a little smug, having shown off his control and his ability to make her go quiet, \\u201cNow, focusing on the matter at hand, tell us about the mental state of the others.\\xa0 You reported Sylvester was acting strange.\\xa0 None of the other Lambs stepped in, forcing him to hand over the reins?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t have to make the mental adjustments to fit his feeling of superiority into her \\u2018act\\u2019, because there was no act.</p>\\n<p>Helen stood from her chair.\\xa0 In her assessments, she\\u2019d found and fixed her eyes on the man at the far left of the table.\\xa0 A young man in a military uniform with the Radham crest on it.\\xa0 A manager of the local armies, organizing and training the local troops, probably.\\xa0 He was, as she had things put in her head, outward facing, a book man, locked in, a <em>decider</em>.\\xa0 She couldn\\u2019t help but visualize the notecards that had taught her about faces and people as she deciphered him.</p>\\n<p>At a glance, she assessed him as the strongest person in the room.\\xa0 He could probably destroy her in a fight.</p>\\n<p>She felt her hearts beat a little faster and harder.\\xa0 She could feel <em>spurting</em> as chemicals flowed from glands in her body.\\xa0 A rush, adrenaline, as if she was about to pick a fight.\\xa0 It all built up to a warmth in her middle.</p>\\n<p>She imagined wrapping her arms around his chest until he <em>stopped</em>.\\xa0 Feeling her cheek against his chest as it went from warm to cool.\\xa0 Going to sleep like that.\\xa0 She wanted to put her thumbs on his eyes and press in until they gave away.</p>\\n<p>Her hands reached out, touching the table.\\xa0 She leaned forward, hair hanging in front of her face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d Ibott said, making it a reprimand.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThinking,\\u201d she said, her voice monotone, glancing only briefly at her creator.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re asking you questions.\\xa0 Sit down,\\u201d Ibott said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you thinking?\\u201d Hayle asked, voice calm.\\xa0 He was gesturing to the men at the door.\\xa0 Helen remembered they had guns.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAbout him,\\u201d Helen said, pointing at the man in the military uniform, and that rush she was feeling did change her voice slightly from the monotone.\\xa0 She could have controlled that if she had wanted to, but this still wasn\\u2019t an act.\\xa0 To the man, she said, \\u201cI\\u2019m very flexible.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m thinking,\\u201d Helen continued, \\u201cAbout if I can crawl into your open mouth.\\xa0 Things would tear apart , of course, but you\\u2019d be warm and you\\u2019d flop around and I want to see what it would feel like if you were doing that while I was most of the way inside you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man\\u2019s hand went to his gun.</p>\\n<p>Ibott\\u2019s chair screeched on the floor as he stood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnough of this,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou told me to stop acting, I did.\\xa0 The acts were the only thing keeping me sitting still,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop,\\u201d he ordered.</p>\\n<p>She went still.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is over,\\u201d Ibott said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s having her appointment.\\xa0 I need to figure out what\\u2019s wrong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not done questioning.\\xa0 Helen, you can speak,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cTell us-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wanted to muck about in Fray\\u2019s insides too,\\u201d Helen said, interrupting him. \\u201cAnd Percy\\u2019s, and Mauer\\u2019s, and the others.\\xa0 That would have been <em>lovely</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She knew the cadence and even the fact that she\\u2019d chosen the word \\u2018lovely\\u2019 was very strange and offputting.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t mind.</p>\\n<p>Hayle didn\\u2019t finish his sentence, only glancing at Ibott.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSuggests she isn\\u2019t a traitor, unless she\\u2019s looking to do that with her friends, too,\\u201d one of Sylvester\\u2019s doctors spoke.</p>\\n<p>Ibott rounded the table.\\xa0 He comprehended the sentence just before grabbing Helen\\u2019s upper arm.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t touch or attack me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would never,\\u201d Helen breathed.\\xa0 The rush was still coloring her words, maybe even her face.\\xa0 She felt like a coiled spring, a catapult ready to fire, a gun with the trigger cocked.\\xa0 But getting <em>release </em>meant feeling parts of someone break in her arms.\\xa0 It was the best feeling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d Ibott said.\\xa0 He steered her around, marching her to the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would never,\\u201d she repeated herself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo us both a favor and shut up,\\u201d Ibott said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause,\\u201d Helen said, \\u201cI only feel this way about strong people, and powerful people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ibott stopped in his tracks.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIbott?\\u201d Hayle asked, from the other end of the room.\\xa0 \\u201cProblem?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t relevant to the topic at hand,\\u201d Ibott said.</p>\\n<p>His grip was tighter, the march more forceful than before, as the doors opened and he steered her past the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>Helen glanced at Gordon as she walked by, smiling, her eyes wide.</p>\\n<p>One hand went to her hair, tossing it back over one shoulder.</p>\\n<p>Her fingers lingered briefly at her collar, as she tugged on it.</p>\\n<p>Better to do this, than to let the questioning continue too long.\\xa0 The more questions she answered, the more chances there were of her giving the wrong answer.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Lillian</strong></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe problems only became apparent when the mission was underway,\\u201d Lillian answered.</p>\\n<p>She was sweating, she kept fidgeting and telling herself to stop, only to resume again without fully realizing it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHigh stress situation, and we knew Jamie was coming, and that added more stress to things?\\xa0 The Lambs are <em>people</em>, we- they had reasons and plans.\\xa0 Sylvester had something to prove to make up for losing to Fray last time, when the whole thing happened with the water supplies.\\xa0 Mary was fixated on Percy, but she saw that one through when she killed him.\\xa0 Then there was Jamie, and he was coming, but I said that part-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh, calm down,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian made a concerted effort.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave you reported on everything that\\u2019s been happening?\\u201d another Professor asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMental issues, health issues\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir.\\xa0 Everything as it\\u2019s come up, even irrelevant things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s been thorough,\\u201d Professor Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen\\u2019s apparent\\u2026 precociousness, and Sylvester\\u2019s failings during this mission, they raise concerns.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStart with Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s been changing gradually for a very long time.\\xa0 She presents one face to us and there\\u2019s more going on beneath the surface, which we only glimpse.\\xa0 She has never indicated any problems.\\xa0 During the mission, she provided a good assessment of Sylvester and if I\\u2019m remembering right, helped us capture a Ghost for Petey, before we knew he was a problem.\\xa0 We later heard it inconvenienced him and Fray, because he had to lure off some Ghosts and take them out of play to keep up the undercover ruse.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cMary, and Percy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m close to Mary, it feels lousy to say stuff when she shared some of it in confidence-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s your <em>job</em>,\\u201d the military man on the far left of the table said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI- it- I-\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She couldn\\u2019t find it in her to put a coherent syllable together.\\xa0 She\\u2019d had nightmares about this sort of thing, being on trial when there was no right answer.\\xa0 Except usually it was an oral exam.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is your job, Lillian, to look after the Lambs, to monitor their performance, and report anything the Academy needs to know,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs- as a friend,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cShe told me things about Percy.\\xa0 About how it was hard to let go.\\xa0 He was like a dad to her.\\xa0 She was always worried he would show up again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe told you she was considering betraying the team and you didn\\u2019t report it?\\u201d another Professor asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She was screwing this up.\\xa0 Everyone had been confident in leaving the room and she was saying all the wrong things.\\xa0 Half the words that left her mouth, she felt like it was the wrong answer before she\\u2019d even spoken and felt like it was a <em>worse</em> answer after she\\u2019d heard herself say it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, she wasn\\u2019t considering betraying the team, or no, you didn\\u2019t report it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI mean, she wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 It never came up, not like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt sounds as if it was pertinent,\\u201d a professor jumped in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t, not for the job, not for what she was doing,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe- she just didn\\u2019t want it hanging over her head, I mean.\\xa0 I think, that was the reason, I think?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A stutter of the brain had made her say \\u2018I think\\u2019 twice in the same sentence.\\xa0 She was pretty sure that was cruel irony.</p>\\n<p>They didn\\u2019t look happy, and they didn\\u2019t look convinced.\\xa0 Professor Hayle leaned closer to another professor so the man could whisper in his ear.\\xa0 People at the left end of the table were talking to each other in a babble of low voices.</p>\\n<p>Lillian had the slip of paper in her sock, she\\u2019d looked at it while she waited for her turn \\u2013 second to last \\u2013 and she had no idea what it meant, which terrified her.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d heard of the Twins.\\xa0 She\\u2019d seen pictures of the Twins\\u2019 victims.\\xa0 She\\u2019d seen their pet warbeasts and had heard about their Doctors, one had a name that recurred in urban legends and scary stories, told in candlelit dormitories after dark.\\xa0 She was pretty sure it was the same person, and all of the legends and stories weren\\u2019t necessarily just stories.</p>\\n<p>The stakes had never been higher, and in her attempt to give an explanation that <em>should</em> have sounded good, she\\u2019d fumbled and made it sound weak.</p>\\n<p>This wasn\\u2019t what she was good at.</p>\\n<p>She was good at studying, and she was good at putting people back together.\\xa0 Even if she needed help with some of the hard stuff.\\xa0 Most of the rest she did was try to keep up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat will be all, I think,\\u201d Headmaster Travers told her.</p>\\n<p>It sounded ominous.</p>\\n<p>She started to rise from her seat, then stopped.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere am I going?\\xa0 The others went to their appointments, or other places, and I\\u2019m not sure if I\\u2019m supposed to go to the dorm room, or wait, or-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester and his doctor should be waiting outside,\\u201d Professor Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe talked it over between questioning Ashton and questioning you.\\xa0 If Sylvester is performing badly, then I feel the most important thing is to maintain routine.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll wrap things up soon, but for the time being, I would like you to look after Sylvester for his appointment.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll need you to be able to administer doses in the field, for longer engagements.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDepending on how the last series of questions go, it might be helpful if we know exactly where to find you,\\u201d the Headmaster said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t do if we had to scurry around to figure out where you\\u2019d gotten off to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>For the nobles</em>.\\xa0 He might as well have said it, it was clear as day.\\xa0 If this went badly, the Lambs would be handed over.\\xa0 Some or all.</p>\\n<p>Lillian turned and left the room, only belatedly realizing she hadn\\u2019t said farewell, or any pleasantries at all.</p>\\n<p>Sylvester was indeed waiting in the hall, talking to the thuggish man that was his doctor.\\xa0 She\\u2019d never liked the man, after seeing him cuff Sy far too hard for a smart-assed remark.</p>\\n<p>Sitting across the hall was Jamie, who had a book in his lap.\\xa0 He was writing, and didn\\u2019t even look up as she approached.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m supposed to come with you,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d the doctor said.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you think I\\u2019d be waiting here for some other reason?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor good conversation with me?\\u201d Sylvester suggested.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d the man made a noise.\\xa0 He looked at Lillian, his eyes traveling all the way up and down her body.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you learn this, I have to deal with him less.\\xa0 I\\u2019m bad at judging ages.\\xa0 How long until I can buy you a drink as thanks?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree years,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll probably forget by then,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian wondered if the man had been asking out of any <em>interest</em>, but the thought creeped her out, and her mind was frazzled from a full half-hour of questioning.\\xa0 She wanted to ask so many questions and get feedback, and she didn\\u2019t dare with the doctor in earshot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBye, Jamie,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie looked up from his book, silent, and raised a hand in a wave, giving a brief smile.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d liked the old Jamie more.\\xa0 He\\u2019d shared books with her and talked to her.\\xa0 They were both bookworms, happier in darkness and quiet than in noise and chaos.\\xa0 <em>This</em> Jamie made her uncomfortable for reasons she couldn\\u2019t put a finger on.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t entirely his fault.\\xa0 When he was around, everyone acted different, and she could see the pain on the faces of some of the people she cared about the most, Sy first among them.</p>\\n<p>The big man that was Sy\\u2019s doctor had an umbrella of matching size.\\xa0 The moment he was outdoors, he lit up a cigarette, then opened the umbrella, inviting the two children to stand beneath, Sy to his right and Lillian to his left.</p>\\n<p>Standing too close felt weird, especially when she wasn\\u2019t sure if he\\u2019d been offering the drink out of gratitude or as a roundabout way of asking her out, or if he\\u2019d genuinely wondered about her age.\\xa0 Keeping that invisible, wary wall between them meant standing so that one of her shoulders was out in the rain, the rest of her under the umbrella\\u2019s cover.</p>\\n<p>The walk to the Tower wasn\\u2019t fast enough.</p>\\n<p>Just before they reached the door, the doctor finished his cigarette and lit another.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you going to expect us to stand around in the rain while you finish that?\\u201d Sylvester asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t care,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan we wait inside?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t care,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou finished answering their questions, so I figure my obligations about watching you are done.\\xa0 I spent forever standing around in there with nothing to do and nobody I wanted to talk to, craving a burn.\\xa0 I\\u2019m going to have two, maybe three.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMake it three, and I\\u2019ll make this one easy on you?\\u201d Sy suggested.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd to look good for her?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou mean you won\\u2019t be a baby and a little ass dribblet?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNeither.\\xa0 I just want a chance to talk to her and get caught up on things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFine.\\xa0 But you\\u2019re owing me a <em>few</em> no-nonsense appointments,\\u201d the man said.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree, then,\\u201d Sylvester said.</p>\\n<p>The man nodded.</p>\\n<p>Lillian\\u2019s heart jumped as Sylvester reached out to grab her wrist.</p>\\n<p>He tugged on her arm, pulling her inside.</p>\\n<p>Alone with Sy.\\xa0 Why did <em>this</em> make her anxious in a good way when she\\u2019d slept in the same bed as him the last two nights?</p>\\n<p>Her heart was already unsteady, she decided.\\xa0 She was in a shaky place and it didn\\u2019t take much to tip the scales.\\xa0 She looked at his wet hair and his narrow shoulders.\\xa0 His shirt clung to him, translucent where it touched the skin.\\xa0 He was about as tan as anyone could get in the rains of Radham and Brechwell, which wasn\\u2019t much at all, but it was something.</p>\\n<p>There were beads of water on the back of his neck.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow did it go?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>She remembered how it had gone, and the emotional high became an emotional low.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBad,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 The low came with a feeling like she wanted to cry, and if she cried, then he would call her a crybaby.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow bad?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI panicked, I didn\\u2019t know what to say, I tried to defend you guys and make you out to be confident, like you knew what you were doing.\\xa0 But they kept attacking you, and I lost track of what I was saying, and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou defended me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes!\\xa0 Of course!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou got the paper from Hubris, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, the paper.\\xa0 What did the paper mean?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sylvester half-turned, staring at her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was important, wasn\\u2019t it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He held up his free hand, gesturing.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t halfway done before she realized what he\\u2019d meant.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow the hell was I supposed to figure that out!?\\xa0 And why should we sacrifice you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause,\\u201d Sy said, \\u201cThey\\u2019re not going to screw over the Lambs because bad science and logistics on their part made me sloppy.\\xa0 It would hurt them, they\\u2019d be hurting themselves if they went to the nobles about that.\\xa0 Especially when the Duke likes me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd <em>I</em> didn\\u2019t expect you to figure it out.\\xa0 It was Gordon\\u2019s plan.\\xa0 A pretty good one.\\xa0 I hope you didn\\u2019t do too good a job of defending me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian huffed out a short, one-note laugh.\\xa0 \\u201cI really didn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood.\\xa0 Helen made a play too, but I won\\u2019t know what it was for sure until I talk to her.\\xa0 I\\u2019m <em>really </em>interested.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre we going to be okay?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 Probably.\\xa0 A very likely scenario is they target one or two of us, in some attempt to clean up the roster and make it look like they\\u2019re doing something effective.\\xa0 In which case I\\u2019m probably the sacrificial play.\\xa0 I get benched, not killed, and you guys actively suck at the job until I return to the picture.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s\\u2026 not so bad.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike I said, good plan,\\u201d Sylvester said.\\xa0 He stopped at a door, opening it.\\xa0 \\u201cMy office.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe doctor\\u2019s office.\\xa0 You\\u2019re the patient.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m <em>impatient</em>,\\u201d Sylvester said.\\xa0 He let go of her wrist and hopped up onto the desk at one side of the narrow room.\\xa0 It was barely bigger than a closet, with lots of bookshelves and both preserved and living animals of various poisonous and venomous varieties.\\xa0 Jars lined shelves.\\xa0\\xa0 \\u201cI want to hear how things went, and we won\\u2019t for a while.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cWas there more you wanted to ask?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAsk?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAbout the questions?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNope,\\u201d Sy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you asked him to stay for a while, and he was already going to finish a cigarette, and\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd I\\u2019m tired of being ferried around and told here to go and what to do and what questions to answer.\\xa0 I feel cornered.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian felt cornered in an office that was about two long paces long and an even shorter length wide, with furniture crammed in it.\\xa0 Murky light filtered in through a narrow, barred window, casting a raindrop-dappled light into the otherwise lightless room.</p>\\n<p>She had to admit she would have felt <em>more</em> cornered if the doctor was also present.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat doctor of yours creeps me out,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep,\\u201d Sylvester said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll be sure to tell him that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t,\\u201d she said, punching his thigh.\\xa0 He was sitting on the desk with his legs dangling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m glad you\\u2019re here,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>She looked up at him.</p>\\n<p>He was so fine-boned, with high cheekbones, and a narrow chin.\\xa0 She could see the individual parts of his shoulders.\\xa0 His hair was wet and swept away from his face, wild and always looking like it was tangled, though it so rarely was.\\xa0 His eyes were an insane green color, very dark, framed by long lashes.</p>\\n<p>When he looked at her, she felt naked.\\xa0 Stripped bare.\\xa0 Not in terms of clothes, but in terms of what was going on in her head and her defenses.</p>\\n<p>It was ten times worse since she had shared a bed with him.\\xa0 She felt very aware of him, and doubly aware of <em>his</em> awareness of <em>her</em>.</p>\\n<p>He was glad she was here?</p>\\n<p>Words like that seemed so very meaningful, coming from someone who seemed to see her so clearly, understanding who she really was.</p>\\n<p><em>\\u2018I know everything about you and I still enjoy your company\\u2019</em></p>\\n<p>Her face was hot, and she knew she was blushing.\\xa0 She turned to look out the window, and saw only a smirk on his face.</p>\\n<p>She would have hit him, but that would have meant admitting that she\\u2019d seen and facing the teasing that followed.</p>\\n<p>He stuck his feet out, one foot pressing against her belly, the other against the small of her back.\\xa0 She managed to make herself turn and give him a curious look.\\xa0 The feet dropped away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been feeling really lonely, since Jamie\\u2026 went.\\xa0 And especially since this Jamie came back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 If he kept talking like this, she\\u2019d get a lump in her throat, or end up crying.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s\\u2026 nice that you\\u2019re here,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou do a good job of making me not feel lonely.\\xa0 You\\u2019re good company.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Again, that look.\\xa0 She felt the heat rise to her face, more intense than before.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think I might go and see if I can get a bit of tea.\\xa0 Do you want some?\\xa0 I\\u2019ll bring some,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She turned to go.</p>\\n<p>She felt a sharp tug at the side of her head.</p>\\n<p>She turned and saw that Sy had grabbed the length of hair that normally framed one side of her face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>She swallowed hard.\\xa0 Her heart drummed.\\xa0 She couldn\\u2019t find words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cCome here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She approached, and watched as he reached out to take hold of the other lock of hair.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to kiss you,\\u201d he said, staring down at her with those penetrating eyes.\\xa0 \\u201cIf that\\u2019s alright.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her lips moved but no air passed through them.\\xa0 She gave him a nod.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen stand on your tiptoes,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>He tugged lightly on her hair, urging her up and forward, to meet him as he leaned down.</p>\\n<p>She obliged.</p>\\n<p>Somewhere, in her fantasies about kissing boys, she had most definitely thought about what kissing Sy would be like.\\xa0 A part of her had told her that no, it wouldn\\u2019t be great, first kisses never were, and Sy was usually terrible at something until he\\u2019d had a little practice.</p>\\n<p>He was a good kisser.\\xa0 His lips were cool to the touch, but he was gentle.\\xa0 His lips brushed hers, then pulled away.\\xa0 She raised herself up a bit further to kiss back, and he kissed her again as a reward.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t long until she was standing on the very tips of her boots, leaning forward, hands on his thighs, trying to meet him, only to experience feather touches of kisses.</p>\\n<p>Then, like he was hungry, a <em>real</em> kiss, full lipped instead of a simple touch, while her entire body was straining up and forward, as if everything led to that contact.</p>\\n<p>The knuckles of one hand that held her hair brushed against her cheek.\\xa0 It was so nice and she\\u2019d already been so close to crying earlier that she wondered if she might tear up.</p>\\n<p>If she dropped down, she knew, it would probably tug her hair against his hand, and it would hurt and it was probably the least of the reasons she didn\\u2019t want to stop straining up and forward, the least of the reasons she didn\\u2019t want this to end.</p>\\n<p>He pulled away, then kissed her, pulled away, and stopped.</p>\\n<p>Teasing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore,\\u201d she whispered.</p>\\n<p>Sylvester cleared his throat.</p>\\n<p>Lillian dropped down to the ground, spinning around.</p>\\n<p>It was worse than she\\u2019d thought.</p>\\n<p>Not just Sy\\u2019s doctor, but Hayle as well.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cA word?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian remained frozen, a deer in the headlights.</p>\\n<p>Sy leaned down, his mouth by her ear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTonight, if you come to my room, I\\u2019ll give you another.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>The worst.\\xa0 He was the absolute worst.</em></p>\\n<p>But it was reason enough to flee the room.</p>\\n<p>She knew she was blushing bright red for Professor Hayle.\\xa0 The professor closed the door.</p>\\n<p>He pointed, and the two of them walked a distance down the hall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo I need to worry?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>Lillian shook her head.</p>\\n<p>Then she remembered the greater situation.\\xa0 \\u201cDo- do we need to worry?\\xa0 The Lambs?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re waiting to talk to Jamie tomorrow.\\xa0 He\\u2019s having an appointment now.\\xa0 The others want to talk and figure out what questions to ask, as he can provide us the clearest perspective, for what he\\u2019s seen, if nothing else.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian felt a sinking feeling in her gut.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think things will be fine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian didn\\u2019t feel convinced.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI came to ask a question.\\xa0 Now I feel we might need to have a discussion.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease no,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a favorite student of mine, with all the promise in the world-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Hayle said, raising his hands.\\xa0 \\u201cAlright.\\xa0 Just let this old man say his piece.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian couldn\\u2019t stop blushing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere was a time, not so long ago, where I worried about Sylvester.\\xa0 All of the Lambs, but Sylvester was among them.\\xa0 When it came to\\u2026 interest in others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen a youth comes of age, it can be hard.\\xa0 Hormones surge, judgment isn\\u2019t always there, unfamiliar feelings\\u2026 if you combine the intensity of feeling with the natural ability of the Lambs to get what they desire, through trickery, problem solving, or sheer <em>charm</em>, keeping in mind Sylvester meets all of the marks, that\\u2019s a difficult issue.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s dangerous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, but he\\u2019s been retarded in physical and emotional growth by the chemicals we inject him with.\\xa0 He\\u2019s a late bloomer in everything but mental faculties.\\xa0 I worried that he would be a danger if he were to turn his attention toward someone in the public, but then he seemed to turn his sights to Mary, and if anyone can defend themselves, it\\u2019s her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to sound as though I don\\u2019t have faith in you, Lillian.\\xa0 But, the Lambs being what they are, it warps them in many ways, in growth and emotion and other things.\\xa0 The arena of love stands to be very dangerous ground.\\xa0 Enough that I considered chemically emasculating the boys and doing much the same for Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian swallowed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to do that.\\xa0 I won\\u2019t tell you not to do <em>this</em>.\\xa0 But I wanted you to know how, looking at the bigger picture, I was <em>wary.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would like you to be <em>wary.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir.\\xa0 Um.\\xa0 The other question?\\xa0 That you came to ask?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Professor Hayle sighed, as if she\\u2019d disappointed him somehow.\\xa0 She hated that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lambs will be splitting up, depending on how the verdict goes.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll find a way to broach the news to them tomorrow, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hayle paused.\\xa0 \\u201cI should have figured.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir.\\xa0 I mean, sir, I didn\\u2019t mean to sound like I was saying you should have, only that-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, Lillian.\\xa0 I know.\\xa0 Do you have any recommendations, from students in your age group?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t have many classes with students in my age group.\\xa0 But I could give you names.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, Lillian.\\xa0 Your parents are coming to visit in a month, I\\u2019m having them to my place.\\xa0 I expect you\\u2019ll come?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf there\\u2019s anything you need,\\u201d Hayle said, glancing in the direction of Sy, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll let me know?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d she lied.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/06/20/stitch-in-time-4-1/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Winter</strong></p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs Mr. Howell expecting you?\\u201d the stitched asked.</p>\\n<p>Warren stared.\\xa0 There were so few of the stitched in Pontiac, and they were the sort of thing that was ignored and people who used them were looked down on.\\xa0 Pontiac was still a city in the Crown\\u2019s dominion, but it was a good distance from any of the Academies and there wasn\\u2019t much love for the Academy\\u2019s work there.</p>\\n<p>Now he was <em>home</em>, and a dead man stood in his father\\u2019s entryway, dressed in a footman\\u2019s clothing.\\xa0 Warren glanced back over his shoulder at his companion, Harry, who quirked an eyebrow in response.\\xa0 Harry\\u2019s sandy-hair was tucked beneath a cap, and he wasn\\u2019t clean-shaven, unfortunately.\\xa0 They\\u2019d stepped right off the train and made their way straight there.\\xa0 Warren had decided to shave while braving the periodic bumps and jostles of the carriage, and had made out with only one nick at his jaw.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m his son,\\u201d Warren finally managed, still a little dumbstruck.\\xa0 \\u201cI sent a telegram ahead, he should be expecting me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis way, sir,\\u201d he told me, stepping back and gesturing.</p>\\n<p>The stitched in Pontiac hadn\\u2019t been so well made.\\xa0 They were haulers, dirty and covered up with heavy clothes and caps, they did the dangerous work until they overheated and fried.\\xa0 Even before the overheating, though, they were rarely able to speak more than one slurred word at a time.\\xa0 Warren had always avoided them.</p>\\n<p>It walked just a little bit stiffly.\\xa0 Harry fell into step beside Warren, exaggerating the stitched\\u2019s gait.\\xa0 Warren elbowed him, hard, and Harry resumed walking normally, still maintaining a shit-eating grin.</p>\\n<p>On a good day, Harry was such a <em>character</em>.\\xa0 On a bad one, he was <em>incorrigible</em>.</p>\\n<p>Warren hoped Harry could lose the smirk soon.\\xa0 The were just now approaching the sitting room.</p>\\n<p>The manservant opened the double doors, and Warren\\u2019s hopes were dashed.</p>\\n<p>The sitting room itself was as he remembered it.\\xa0 There were three sets of arching double doors opening to the outside, partially made of glass, a large window, and more archways that hid slightly recessed bookshelves.\\xa0 The hardcover books had gold lettering, some faded more than others.\\xa0 The furniture was ornate, some of which had been antiques when his grandfather had been young.</p>\\n<p>His father and another man stood in the middle of the sitting room, beside what looked to be an eighteen year old girl in a state of undress from the waist up, only a brassiere covering her.</p>\\n<p>Warren\\u2019s father looked at him with a moment\\u2019s surprise, then smiled.\\xa0 Harry\\u2019s grin was ear to ear, positively <em>delighting </em>in Warren\\u2019s situation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFather.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWarren!\\u201d his father said, approaching.\\xa0 \\u201cSo good to see you!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren accepted the hug stiffly, not quite sure what to do.\\xa0 His father was a tall man, but he\\u2019d dropped some weight, and felt surprisingly frail under Warren\\u2019s arms.\\xa0 His father was from Cardiff, tall, dark, and surprisingly genial for how grim he could look.</p>\\n<p>His mother, not yet present, was short, but of brawny English-speaking German stock.\\xa0 Warren had been blessed with the best traits of both, putting him above average in height and of a respectable solid build, and years at university had put some muscle on his frame.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look different,\\u201d his father said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI feel different,\\u201d Warren said, trying not to look at the elephant in the room.</p>\\n<p>His father smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s been a long time, Warren,\\u201d the other man in the room said.</p>\\n<p>Warren paid attention to him for the first time, an old man with a very thick beard and a white lab coat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoctor Pegram?\\xa0 You\\u2019re right<em>.\\xa0 </em>It\\u2019s been forever.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot since you were small.\\xa0 I watched you grow up, and now your father tells me you\\u2019ve just finished your studies?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHalfway across the Crown States, Doctor, yes.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been learning about machines and machinery,\\u201d Warren said, feeling a little embarrassed at the admission.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood on you.\\xa0 Not enough young people working with the <em>hard</em> sciences.\\xa0 It\\u2019s all chemicals and biology, ratios and balances instead of numbers and calculations,\\u201d the doctor said, gesturing at himself.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy machines, Warren?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI, uh, always liked cars, sir,\\u201d Warren said.\\xa0 His eye flickered toward the woman.</p>\\n<p>The doctor smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t mind her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s rather hard not to,\\u201d he admitted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, of course,\\u201d his father said, \\u201cWendy, get dressed, please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The woman moved, and immediately Warren recognized her as a stitched.\\xa0 The movements were slightly <em>off.\\xa0 </em>Her scars, however, were so faint that they only appeared in the right light, light pink and faintly reflective.</p>\\n<p>When she raised her hands up to pull her hair out from beneath her shirt, he saw how there was a piece of metal embedded into the side of her neck, back near the spine.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s yours?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 She cleans and runs small errands.\\xa0 She requires a little bit more care when instructions are given,</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been gone five years, and when I return, you\\u2019re employing stitched?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTimes change, son.\\xa0 All the arable land surrounding Radham is being co-opted by the Academy.\\xa0 I manage the farms and farmers as best I can, to give them work, but the Academy grows bigger, stronger, better crops.\\xa0 Blight doesn\\u2019t touch their plants, and they use stitched labor.\\xa0 I have to make concessions if I want to compete.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren glanced again at Harry, worried it was too sensitive a discussion when they had a guest.\\xa0 Two, if Dr. Pegram was included.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s alright, Warren.\\xa0 There were a few bad years, but we\\u2019re managing well enough.\\xa0 Using stitched for the field work was a hard choice, it meant turning some laborers away, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man sighed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo other choice?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo good ones.\\xa0 I forgot what it might look like to someone coming at this from an objective standpoint, I don\\u2019t think of them as anything more than tools.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren nodded.\\xa0 He felt uncomfortable with the notion, but he couldn\\u2019t put his finger on why, or how he might fix it.\\xa0 Instead, he changed the subject.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI almost forgot.\\xa0 Father, Dr. Pegram, this is Harry, my friend from school.\\xa0 Harry, this is my father, Mr. Clifford Howell, and Dr. Pegram, the man who pulled me into this world and looked after me for the first ten or twelve years after that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to meet you, Mr. Howell, Dr. Pegram,\\u201d Harry said.\\xa0 He stepped forward, hand extended.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs Harry only visiting Radham?\\u201d Warren\\u2019s father asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m here to stay, as a matter of fact.\\xa0 Warren and I are starting our own business, building and fixing up cars.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was top of my class in the building,\\u201d Warren said.\\xa0 \\u201cHarry\\u2019s grades were\\u2026 less stellar, but he\\u2019s a salesman through and through, and he knows just where we can get started.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcellent,\\u201d his father said.\\xa0 \\u201cMight have some competition from the academy.\\xa0 There\\u2019s something to be said for the carriages we\\u2019re all used to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s something to be said for cars, too,\\u201d Harry said.</p>\\n<p>Warren half-turned as he saw a movement in the doorway.\\xa0 His mother.\\xa0 Smiling, he met her halfway and wrapped her in a hug.</p>\\n<p>She had to raise herself up on her toes to touch his face, and she put one hand on him to steady herself as she plucked the cap off his head.\\xa0 \\u201cNo hats indoors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry, mother,\\u201d Warren said, a little abashed to be talked to like a little boy while Harry was around.\\xa0 He saw Harry snatch the cap from his own head, lightning quick.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSit, please,\\u201d his mother said.\\xa0 \\u201cWendy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The stitched girl turned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFill the teapot with the boiling water from the stove, I\\u2019ve already got teabags in there.\\xa0 And, let me see-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t count me among your guests,\\u201d the doctor said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ve already been so hospitable, and I\\u2019m on my way out the door.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFour cups, then, Wendy.\\xa0 Farewell, Doctor,\\u201d she said, giving the man a brief hug.</p>\\n<p>They settled themselves on armchairs and couches that had been positioned around the little coffee table.</p>\\n<p>The small talk never happened.\\xa0 Warren\\u2019s father sat, giving him a peculiar look, then squinted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFather?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look different, Warren.\\xa0 I thought it might be your hair, or your brow, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren felt his heart skip a beat as his father circled the table.\\xa0 The grip on Warren\\u2019s chin was surprisingly strong and fierce as his father forced his head up at an angle, so he was looking up at the man.</p>\\n<p>No geniality now.\\xa0 Only the <em>grim</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour eyes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, heh,\\u201d Warren said.\\xa0 \\u201cHarry convinced me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s true, I did.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Blue</em>?\\u201d his father asked, no humor in his tone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy vision is sharper, too.\\xa0 The change in color from brown was purely cosmetic.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt looks <em>wrong,</em>\\u201d his father said, and there was something in his voice that made Warren feel deeply uncomfortable.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cClifford,\\u201d his mother said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t make mountains out of molehills.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t a molehill, if my suspicions are right.\\xa0 Or are you going to tell me this will go away on its own.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s permanent, father.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was a lark, sir,\\u201d Harry said.\\xa0 \\u201cI convinced him it was cheaper to change his eyes than to buy eyeglasses every few years.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChanged how?\\u201d the man\\u2019s words had a hollowness to them.\\xa0 \\u201cTorn out and swapped in with another man\\u2019s?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey rewrote the language that determines how my eyes should be,\\u201d Warren said.</p>\\n<p>Warren\\u2019s father let go of his chin as if he\\u2019d been burned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know you\\u2019re more conservative, father, but if you\\u2019re employing stitched-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis and that are two <em>very</em> different things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a very minor change.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Harry chimed in, \\u201cAn attractive one.\\xa0 I told him it would get him all the girls, an ice blue stare, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Please,</em>\\u201d Warren\\u2019s father said, in the gentleman\\u2019s way of saying something polite while declaring that Harry might get struck if he kept talking.</p>\\n<p>Harry dutifully shut up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve heard about this,\\u201d the older man said.\\xa0 \\u201cRewriting our very <em>being</em>.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve heard the concerns.\\xa0 It carries <em>forward</em>, Warren.\\xa0 When you have a child, there is a very good chance it will have the same sort of eyes.\\xa0 This <em>alien</em> blueness.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2026 yes.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve heard that,\\u201d Warren said.\\xa0 The blueness was a remark on the deepness of the blue.\\xa0 Most had a pale blue color to their eyes, but Warren had elected for a shade and hue that was closer to what might be found on a flower.</p>\\n<p>A moment\\u2019s decision, after drinking with Harry and several other friends.\\xa0 A lark, as Harry had suggested.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cClifford,\\u201d Warren\\u2019s mother said, standing and reaching out.\\xa0 But the man was so filled with repressed anger that she seemed to hesitate to approach.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFather,\\u201d Warren said, trying to use the moment, \\u201cIt\\u2019s easily changed back.\\xa0 Same process.\\xa0 A needle in the arm, and a few weeks to adjust.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh?\\u201d his father asked.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you have the, what do you call it, the language, the script of your eyes as they once were?\\xa0 Or are you simply trying to mime the old color?\\xa0 A guess on the part of whatever doctor you subject yourself to?\\xa0 How is that different?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou make it sound like the end of the world!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s the end of <em>us</em>!\\u201d his father said, suddenly shouting.</p>\\n<p>The statement seemed to bring everything in the room to a standstill.</p>\\n<p>The stitched girl stood in the doorway with tea on a tray.\\xa0 Her head was bowed, and the plates on the platter rattled as her hands shook.</p>\\n<p>Warren\\u2019s mother flew to the stitched girl\\u2019s side, to console and to take the tray, the murmured words indistinct.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe end of us?\\u201d Warren asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re the product of your mother and I, as we\\u2019re the product of those who came before.\\xa0 But any child you have now will be a product of you, your wife, and the Academy\\u2019s work.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t yet know how these little things will carry forward, or if there will be long term repercussions, for you or your children.\\xa0 Such a <em>stupid</em> thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The word was like a slap.\\xa0 <em>Stupid.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s minor.\\xa0 Nothing of importance in the grand scheme of it all,\\u201d Warren said, a little more obstinate now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s important to <em>me.\\xa0 </em>Do you understand?\\xa0 You\\u2019ve tainted the bloodline.\\xa0 You\\u2019re not truly my son anymore, not in full.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>If the word \\u2018stupid\\u2019 had been a slap, this was a strike to the gut.\\xa0 Warren felt all of the tension that had built up over the argument now seizing him.\\xa0 In shock, he was no longer sure how to move or properly think.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWarren,\\u201d Harry said, putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cPerhaps we should go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat might be a good idea,\\u201d Warren\\u2019s father said.</p>\\n<p>Warren nodded, dumb.\\xa0 He looked at his mother, on the other side of the room, still consoling the stitched girl.</p>\\n<p>He and Harry left, Warren more stiff than either of the stitched had been.\\xa0 Down the long hallway, past the stairs, and out the door, into bright sunlight.\\xa0 Radham was just on the horizon, past the patchwork white-brown and white of snow-dusted farmland, ringed by buildings that spewed dark fumes into the air.\\xa0 A perpetual raincloud hung over the city.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWarren,\\u201d his mother said, behind him.</p>\\n<p>He turned.</p>\\n<p>She pressed a slip of paper into his hand.</p>\\n<p>He looked down at it, too caught up in a storm of emotion to process it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMoney.\\xa0 To get you off the ground and tide you over the first year or so, if you\\u2019re frugal.\\xa0 It was intended as a graduation present from me to you.\\xa0 It <em>is </em>a graduation present.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he said, but he still felt adrift, confused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll talk to him, Warren.\\xa0 He <em>cares,</em> but he\\u2019s had to adapt so much so quickly, this caught him off guard, so soon after he\\u2019d already made monumental sacrifices.\\xa0 Send us another telegram so we know where you are, so I can reunite you two when he\\u2019s calmed down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWill he?\\u201d Warren asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe will,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She gave his arm a squeeze.</p>\\n<p>He nodded, but the wound still felt raw.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTake Wendy and the carriage.\\xa0 Go where you need to today, to get yourself situated and run any errands.\\xa0 Wendy can help you, and she can do a surprising amount of carrying.\\xa0 Send them back tomorrow, if you can.\\xa0 She knows how to use the carriage and how to ask for directions if she needs them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you sure?\\u201d he asked, eyeing the young stitched dubiously.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe needs it, frankly.\\xa0 Her disposition always improves after a good carriage ride.\\xa0 It would be a favor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren nodded.\\xa0 His mother was lying, but perhaps she wanted to keep an eye on him.\\xa0 Not an entirely bad thing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook after him, Wendy,\\u201d Warren\\u2019s mother said.\\xa0 \\u201cDo as he asks, okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, ma\\u2019am.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s go,\\u201d Harry said, a hand on Warren\\u2019s shoulder.\\xa0 He used the hand to guide Warren into the horse-driven carriage.</p>\\n<p>Warren sat and stared blankly at the wall.\\xa0 He blinked as Harry slammed the door, then again as Harry sat across from him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s go,\\u201d Harry said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think you\\u2019re in dire need of an unhealthy amount of drink.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p><strong>Spring</strong></p>\\n<p>Every morning, it was the same.\\xa0 Replaying the discussion with his father, fragments of memory about the afternoon and evening that had followed.\\xa0 Drinking, meeting Harry\\u2019s friends in Radham.</p>\\n<p>Some had altered themselves, more than very blue eyes.\\xa0 A girl with horns, a young man who had added muscle to himself.\\xa0 Among Warren and the other students in Pontiac, Harry had been the roughest around the edges, too clever for his own good, always a little disheveled.</p>\\n<p>Harry\\u2019s friends in Radham were a dozen long strides in that same direction.\\xa0 Smart as a whip, all of them, but not in the academic sense.\\xa0 Quick to insult, joke, jibe.\\xa0 Warren hadn\\u2019t been able to keep up, especially as the drinks had added up.</p>\\n<p>He remembered <em>blood</em>, and he wrested his thoughts away from that particular sequence of events.</p>\\n<p>He tried to raise a hand to his face, and felt it move, felt the air against it, the shift of muscles.\\xa0 But the sensation folded on itself, the sensations continuing onward in his psyche until they had dissolved into smoke.</p>\\n<p>Every morning, it was like this.\\xa0 Discovering how badly things had gone, one way or another.</p>\\n<p>It was the movement in the corner of his eye that usually did it, or movement in front of him, sleep-bleary eyes making out the general shape of the surroundings.</p>\\n<p>Waking up like this might never become routine.\\xa0 Perhaps because it was too far removed from the reality he understood.\\xa0 Perhaps because he didn\\u2019t <em>want</em> to realize.\\xa0 Waking up in confusion, with a dawning feeling of horror, that was <em>better</em>.\\xa0 It was <em>best</em>, all things considered.\\xa0 It hinted at how low his expectations should be.</p>\\n<p>There was no dawning feeling of horror in the pit of his stomach.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t feel sweat run down his back.</p>\\n<p>His hands didn\\u2019t clench.</p>\\n<p>His toes didn\\u2019t curl.</p>\\n<p>His heartbeat didn\\u2019t pick up in speed.</p>\\n<p>His blood didn\\u2019t run cold.</p>\\n<p>None of those things <em>were, </em>not anymore.</p>\\n<p>He turned his head, and it was difficult.\\xa0 He had a limited amount of mobility, and the skin pulled tight with even a small turn.</p>\\n<p>The surroundings were dark, lit only by a slice of light that cut between curtains.\\xa0 It looked to be a cellar or a basement.\\xa0 One he had seen every morning for the last week.</p>\\n<p>It was the smallest of blessings that things changed locations once every week or two.\\xa0 A change of scenery.</p>\\n<p>As his eyes focused, he saw the movements.\\xa0 Shapes in his immediate peripheral vision, and in front of him.\\xa0 Tubes, wires, and <em>heads</em>.</p>\\n<p>Heads without bodies, hair shorn, mounted on a piece of metal, tubes running into the spaces and mounts, giving blood, hydration and nutrients, drawing everything else out.</p>\\n<p>They moved, jaws opening wide, teeth clacking, the ones that weren\\u2019t asleep in the midst of a silent, mad rage.</p>\\n<p>He opened his mouth to speak, and the air didn\\u2019t come as he bid it.\\xa0 The only tongue that moved was the one his mind conjured up, made of smoke.\\xa0 His tongue had been removed a long while ago.\\xa0 Too easy to bite it off and attempt to bleed out or choke.</p>\\n<p>The thought provoked the flurry of images he\\u2019d tried so hard to push out of his mind.</p>\\n<p>He remembered himself, partying with Harry and Harry\\u2019s friends.</p>\\n<p>He remembered seeing them talking among themselves, every time he came out of the washroom, or every time he found himself occupied with something or someone.\\xa0 Furtive talks.\\xa0 He\\u2019d imagined them discussing his situation at home, his father\\u2019s rage, and he\\u2019d deliberately ignored it, drinking more.</p>\\n<p>He remembered how, late in the evening, when it had been just them, Harry\\u2019s friends had grabbed him.</p>\\n<p>Harry had helped himself to the note that would let him access the money, then he had given the signal.</p>\\n<p>The group had lifted Warren up, then tipped him over.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d dropped several stories.\\xa0 He remembered seeing Wendy on landing.\\xa0 She and the carriage had been just outside the building.</p>\\n<p>When he\\u2019d woken up, it had been like this.</p>\\n<p>Body ruined, head salvaged, kept indefinitely on life support.</p>\\n<p>He stared through bleary eyes as a man pushed a curtain aside, where the curtain served in place of a door.\\xa0 Disheveled, with a thick beard, the man wore no lab coat.\\xa0 He looked more like someone who might be found sleeping at the side of the road, a bottle in hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTea,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe usual.\\xa0 Then brush their hair and sponge them off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Wendy was heard to say.</p>\\n<p>Warren had only a glimpse of the stitched as she went about her day.\\xa0 Left untended, she was fidgeting more, anxious.\\xa0 Something about dealing with the heads left her more concerned each time, and her poor condition was part of it.</p>\\n<p>Had Warren been able to speak, he would have insisted she be taken care of, or sent back where she came from.</p>\\n<p>He doubted he would be heard.\\xa0 No man that could do <em>this</em> had any mercy in him.</p>\\n<p>The man approached the table, and though he couldn\\u2019t <em>breathe</em>, Warren could smell the rank odor of the man.\\xa0 He saw the man reach out and stroke the hair of one of the heads.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood morning, my pretties,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 He consulted a notebook.\\xa0 \\u201cThinking Machine project, version three, day\\u2026 hm.\\xa0 Day fifty-three.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren stared.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t the numbers that mattered, the number of days or even the implication that there had been two versions before this.</p>\\n<p>The <em>horror</em> that he experienced, a frustrated horror that had nowhere to go but his <em>head</em>, nothing to do but compound itself, was because of the words \\u2018good morning\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>Twelve to sixteen hours before sleep could claim him again.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren started screaming, twisting, face contorting, best as he was able, though no sound came out.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Summer</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Sweat ran down his brow.\\xa0 He felt the coolness of the water as his scalp was gently dabbed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Wendy fidgeted.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been maintained, but it had been a rough job, and had left deep scars in her flesh, where before there had been only faint ones.\\xa0 The ongoing damage to her strange psyche was something else altogether.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m supposed to watch over you,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cMadam said so.\\xa0 I very much look forward to going home, as soon as you give the word.\\xa0 This place is dark and\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She leaned close, as if to share a secret.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201c\\u2026I don\\u2019t like the dark, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren did his best to nod, a sympathetic look on his face.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI have a teddy bear I hug when it\\u2019s dark.\\xa0 It was a gift.\\xa0 I know I\\u2019m a young lady now, but it does make me feel better,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He nodded, though it made his jaw and neck hurt.\\xa0 His brain felt fried.\\xa0 Wires ran in and out of his skull, connecting to the others, and several times a day, the thinking machine was put in use.\\xa0 The machine would play out a long stuttering series of clicks, the madman who\\u2019d put him down here would make a few notes, then take them with him as he walked into another part of the building, peering at them and scratching his head.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t think I know how to go back,\\u201d Wendy said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m supposed to get directions to the Ossuary, then I go down\\u2026 I can\\u2019t remember the road.\\xa0 Then\\u2026 I can\\u2019t remember what comes next.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Every day, she talked to him.\\xa0 Most days, she said the same things.\\xa0 When her pattern changed, it was because she was breaking down, running too hot.\\xa0 What he hadn\\u2019t picked up from idle curiosity before, back in Pontiac, he\\u2019d learned from the madman\\u2019s occasional comments.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren held onto this, but he wasn\\u2019t sure why.\\xa0 A part of him hoped she would snap, go crazy, and end all of this, or murder the madman.\\xa0 Stitched did that, didn\\u2019t they?\\xa0 Or was that rumor, heard in a city that didn\\u2019t like stitched?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A part of him hoped she would leave, forgetting that she had to look after him.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And, running contrary to that, a part of him feared her leaving, above all else.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He was supposed to have lost his mind by now.\\xa0 He already had, to a degree, and the memories he pulled up now and again were too real, dreamlike, while his dreams were indistinguishable from memory, or they simply brought him back here.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He was being drugged, he suspected, to keep him from panicking or having a stroke, but he still panicked with regularity, his thoughts looping over and over.\\xa0 Sometimes hours passed in the blink of an eye, like that, and sometimes what felt like hours of mad panic were only as long as it took the madman to leave, cook, eat, and return.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI miss music,\\u201d Wendy said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s this tune, it plays in my head, and it goes, ba ba ba, ba ba, ba ba ba\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A body with only a partial brain, and a head without a body, Warren still had the phantom sensations of movements or feelings his body might have experienced, and he\\u2019d learned that, unburied by fever and stress, Wendy had phantom traces of an identity, complete with memories.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Silently, with all the focus he could bring to bear, he scrawled promises on his brain with a permanence that he might use to etch words on stone tablets.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">To make amends, to show gratitude, because he couldn\\u2019t bring himself to pray and he needed to do something of magnitude to have an iota of vision for the future, he promised her a teddy bear, he promised her her music\\u2026</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Autumn<br/>\\n</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The cell door slammed shut.\\xa0 He stirred to wakefulness, blinking, though he hadn\\u2019t been asleep.\\xa0 Reality and dream blended in together, now.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He was fantasizing, or dreaming.\\xa0 The madman having his world turned upside down, screaming about the loss of his life\\u2019s work, the thinking machine.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Men of the law arresting the madman, then approaching the <em>board, </em>where three of the original nine heads were still functional, the number of wires tripled to compensate.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Fantasy?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">No.\\xa0 The smells and tastes and touches\\u2026</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Wendy was standing beside him, stroking his hair.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be okay,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He didn\\u2019t dare hope.\\xa0 Easier to think he was still in the basement, and that reality had slipped away entirely.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He realized that someone was staring at him.\\xa0 The world seemed so distorted.\\xa0 He was higher up than he was used to, almost five feet off the ground.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He\\u2019d once been six feet tall, he remembered.\\xa0 That life felt so far away.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The person in the cell was a young woman, not much older than he was.\\xa0 Or older than he\\u2019d <em>been</em>.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t sure he was a he anymore.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">His thoughts were rambling, he knew.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Her hair was black, a contrast to Wendy\\u2019s blonde hair, cut straight, and tucked behind one ear, while it obscured the other.\\xa0 Her eyes were narrow and dark, her mouth curved in a light smile, painted crimson.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She wore a lab coat, he realized.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He looked away, bothered.\\xa0 The science, the <em>doctors</em>, all of it, he\\u2019d seen what it came to, in the end.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Not just what he\\u2019d experienced, but <em>Wendy</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So many horrors, so many lines crossed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He couldn\\u2019t turn his head away, not really, but he averted his eyes, watching the officers patrolling the room.\\xa0 Half of it was desks, half of it was cells, a single row with one occupant per cell.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He was good at letting time slip by, now.\\xa0 He knew the techniques.\\xa0 Count the cracks, count the bars.\\xa0 Study the people.\\xa0 The guards, their habits, their way of dress.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There were so many new sensations and things to experience that he wasn\\u2019t able to process it all.\\xa0 He was <em>free</em>, but he wasn\\u2019t sure what that entailed.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t dare hope for one thing or the other, out of fear that if he hoped for death and got a second chance instead, or vice versa, it might break him.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The <em>clang</em> of the cell door opening was startling.\\xa0 He\\u2019d been watching the people, but the people had taken action without him noticing.\\xa0 There was a man in a grey coat in the cell in front of him, with guards gathered loosely around.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019ll be getting these injections twice a day for a week.\\xa0 You know what these do, Ms. Fray.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou want to make me forget.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cEven if it does damage to other parts of my mind in the process.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNothing has been proven on that front.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She made a scoffing sound.\\xa0 She sounded so cavalier.\\xa0 Did she not realize what the Academy\\u2019s people were capable of doing?\\xa0 Even without a lab coat, the madman and his thinking machine <em>had</em> been the Academy\\u2019s doing.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren had had enough time to puzzle that much out.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf you do this, you can go to the underground laboratories, you can work on projects, live in dorms\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cA half life.\\xa0 I made my bid for professorship, I failed, and you take half of everything.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSome people would kill for this much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOr carry out a crazed experiment in their basement with limited resources?\\xa0 Trying to make nine heads think as one?\\u201d Ms. Fray asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cEven that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll take a lifetime of imprisonment if it means keeping my brain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou don\\u2019t get a choice, Ms. Fray.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI can tell you that I took a dose of the Wyvern formula just this morning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what that means.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cContraindicated.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t tell me you got your grey coat without knowing what <em>contraindicated</em> means.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI know what it means.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve never heard of the formula, and quite frankly, after having read your files, I suspect you\\u2019re lying, to delay the inevitable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAsk Professor Hayle.\\xa0 He\\u2019ll know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was a pause.\\xa0 Then, \\u201cLock her up.\\xa0 Watch her.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll be back later this evening after I\\u2019ve confirmed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren watched as the guards and the doctor in the grey coat vacated the cell.\\xa0 The door clanged shut, making Wendy flinch, and they went about their way, the grey-coat exiting through the door at the far end of the building.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Long minutes passed.\\xa0 Ms. Fray paced, leaned against the bars to peer further into the building, and alternately watched Wendy, watched Warren, and studied the guards.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Some time had passed before she cleared her throat, standing straighter.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Within the cell, the woman raised a finger to crimson lips.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Wendy did the same, echoing the gesture.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The cell was equipped with a toilet behind a short barrier, intended for privacy.\\xa0 Ms. Fray approached the toilet, then bent over it, hand going to her throat.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren still felt like this was all a dream.\\xa0 Too surreal.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He saw Ms. Fray stand up, now with a writhing tentacle coming out of her mouth.\\xa0 She gripped the tentacles, grunting and making choking sounds, as she hauled it out, excruciating inch by excruciating inch.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It took a minute and a half, by Warren\\u2019s estimation, before she\\u2019d retrieved the entire thing.\\xa0 It coiled and uncoiled, tentacles reaching out and wrapping around her hands and forearms.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat are you grunting and moaning about?\\u201d a guard asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But as the guard reached the cell, Ms. Fray was sitting on the toilet, the tentacled horror pinned between her back and the toilet\\u2019s tank, blocked from view by the barrier.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The guard shook her head, turned, and walked away.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ms. Fray reached under her dress.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren averted his eyes, horrified.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He heard a titter.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When he looked up, she had what looked to be a large piece of glass.\\xa0 No more tentacles.\\xa0 From the speed with which she\\u2019d acted, he suspected it had been tucked into the band.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Again, she raised a finger to her mouth, the universal gesture for silence.\\xa0 This time, however, she had a piece of glass in her hand, and the tentacle-thing held behind her back.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The second guard paced down the building, then headed back up toward Ms. Fray.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The moment he passed by the cell, she reached out, and the tentacles did as well, snaring him by the head and throat, pulling him tight against the bars.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cFeel that?\\u201d Ms. Fray asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMmph,\\u201d the guard said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThen don\\u2019t touch your pistol.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The other guard had heard the crash of skull against bars.\\xa0 The woman approached at a half-run from the far end of the building.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cKeys,\\u201d Ms. Fray said, calm.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can reach the door.\\xa0 Work fast.\\xa0 If she gets here before the door is open, I\\u2019m going to cut your throat so my pet is free to stop her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The guard fumbled, keys rattling.\\xa0 He reached up, holding the keys at an awkward angle to see which one he was selecting.</p>\\n<p>The key went into the lock.\\xa0 He turned it, and the door came open.</p>\\n<p>Ms. Fray hauled him in a touch deeper, then gripped the sliding door, hauling it open.\\xa0 With the man\\u2019s head between the bars, the sliding door caught him in the side of the head or the neck.</p>\\n<p>Warren saw the other guard approaching at a swift run.</p>\\n<p>She rounded the corner, standing back this time, pistol raised.</p>\\n<p>Ms. Fray was crouched, the other guard\\u2019s pistol in hand, tentacles coiling at one side.</p>\\n<p>The woman guard had to take the time to figure out what was going on, the position of her target, and adjust before pulling, aiming between the bars.</p>\\n<p>Ms. Fray only had to pull the trigger as soon as the moving target came into view.</p>\\n<p>Three shots, in quick succession.</p>\\n<p>Covered in a light spattering of blood, Ms. Fray stepped out of her cell.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou.\\xa0 You saw what I just did,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m going to <em>keep</em> doing it, over and over, in ways both dramatic and subtle.\\xa0 You can come with me and <em>help,</em> or you can stay here and be at their mercy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe?\\u201d Wendy asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHim.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren blinked.</p>\\n<p><em>Mercy doesn\\u2019t exist</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve got to go.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll have heard shots.\\xa0 Yes or no, do you want revenge?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He thought of Harry.</p>\\n<p>He thought of the Madman.</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>She reached out to scoop him up.\\xa0 Wendy got in the way.</p>\\n<p>Warren rolled his eyes over to Wendy, then back to Ms. Fray, then to Wendy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou too, then.\\xa0 Bring him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wendy nodded.</p>\\n<p>Ms. Fray collected the keys.\\xa0 She walked backward, facing Warren, pointing at the cells.</p>\\n<p>He looked.</p>\\n<p>A stranger.\\xa0 Another stranger.\\xa0 Empty.\\xa0 A stranger.</p>\\n<p>The madman.</p>\\n<p>He must have given some tell.\\xa0 Another shot from the pistol rang out.\\xa0 The madman died, a shot through the head.</p>\\n<p>The gun twirled on Ms. Fray\\u2019s finger as she turned her back on Warren and his stitched friend, marching for the exit.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Winter</strong></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The creature squealed as it died, crushed under a meaty fist.\\xa0 Bird, bug and reptile blended together, it was the size of a large dog, and surprisingly hard to kill.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren stretched, then heaved out a heavy breath.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIs it safe?\\u201d Ms. Fray asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYes,\\u201d Wendy said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ms. Fray opened the door and stepped out of the washroom.\\xa0 She looked down at the stain in disgust.\\xa0 \\u201cWhelps.\\xa0 One of the Academy\\u2019s weapons.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf there\\u2019s one here, there\\u2019ll be more.\\xa0 They have our scent.\\xa0 We\\u2019re relocating.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren nodded, again.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ms. Fray led the way, but she usually did.\\xa0 She always walked briskly, she rarely held back, if she was even capable, and she expected everyone else to keep up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Not that Warren had much difficulty.\\xa0 He was taller than he\\u2019d been with his original body, to the point he almost had to bend double to get through the door.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The city swirled with snow.\\xa0 Mad creatures and doctors were everywhere, and he felt his head hurt as he glanced at each.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t a <em>pleasant</em> place, this, but it was good for camouflage.\\xa0 Ms. Fray and Warren looked entirely normal walking down the street.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI keep expecting them to lose interest, but they up the ante each time.\\xa0 Academy investigators, monsters, The Hangman, Dog and Catcher\\u2026 now the Whelps.\\xa0 They really, <em>really</em> want me,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Warren nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He saw a movement out of the corner of his eye.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Stray cat.\\xa0 He might not have seen it if it weren\\u2019t for his sharp eyes.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A second later, a fanged beak snapped out, consuming half of the cat.\\xa0 A tongue snaked around the rest, and hauled it into the creature\\u2019s gullet.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Another whelp.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI saw it too,\\u201d Genevieve said.\\xa0 She gave him a pat on the arm, where his striped sweater was rolled up to the elbow.\\xa0 His forearm was bigger around than her upper body, his fist large enough that when he held Wendy\\u2019s hand, it consumed the hand and most of her forearm.\\xa0 \\u201cIt won\\u2019t come out into the daylight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">His strength and new body was of her design.\\xa0 She\\u2019d asked what he\\u2019d wanted, and with a writing implement in his temporary hand, he\\u2019d scrawled out a simple word.\\xa0 \\u2018Strength\\u2019.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He didn\\u2019t trust his sanity, but he trusted his <em>mind.\\xa0 </em>It had always been sharp.\\xa0 The only flaw had been that it had been too trusting.\\xa0 No longer.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Now he had a body to match the mind.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">They approached the train station, amid a light snowfall.\\xa0 Ms. Fray led the way toward a side street.\\xa0 If they were catching a train, they\\u2019d hitch a ride in a car carrying crates or hay, so witnesses wouldn\\u2019t be able to report on them.\\xa0 It had bought them some time in the past.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She put a hand to his chest, stopping mid-stride.\\xa0 He had to go to some effort to stop fast enough.\\xa0 Had he been any slower, he might have forced her wrist or arm backward and snapped them.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She didn\\u2019t seem to notice or care.\\xa0 Her eyes were on the train station across the street.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Passengers were getting off.\\xa0 Young, old, many of them women and girls attending the local women\\u2019s Academy.\\xa0 A small school, but popular.\\xa0 Many a father conceded to his daughter\\u2019s wishes to study, but insisted on something like this.\\xa0 A quiet, safe town and an unthreatening learning environment.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThere,\\u201d Genevieve said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey got off a few seconds ago.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He watched.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe Lambs,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He frowned, then realized she was talking about the children.\\xa0 Just on the verge of adolescence, all six of them, they walked with purpose, working their way through the gaps in the crowd.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey finally caught up,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He glanced at her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cChange of plans,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re staying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/10/lamb-to-the-slaughter-6-12/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The nature of our enemy forced us to change up our approach, given how \\u2018stealthy\\u2019 meant a very different thing when dealing with enemies who could suss out our locations by <em>hearing</em> them.</p>\\n<p>They had eyes, too, but I had no idea if they relied on those eyes to the same extent we did.\\xa0 It meant we had to pick and choose our positions carefully.\\xa0 We made our way up the stairs to the floor above, the relay serving its purpose well.\\xa0 With the four hallways below, people steadily evacuating under the Duke\\u2019s watchful eye, I could at least hope that my back was covered.\\xa0 Lillian moved with her escort, and Jamie and I moved as a pair, five to ten paces behind Helen.</p>\\n<p>We stopped halfway up a set of stairs covered in red carpet, the railings some special wood with a marble-like texture and gold-colored caps.\\xa0 I reached up to a picture; I was too short to reach it with my hand, but I could reach it with the point of my knife.\\xa0 I got the blade between the picture and the wall, twisted, and pried it off, with a slight <em>crack</em>.\\xa0 I poked the underside to lift it up, and it came free of the wall.\\xa0 I caught it.\\xa0 Some Professor\\u2019s painted portrait.\\xa0 He looked like a smug twat.</p>\\n<p>Jamie did much the same, even utilizing my technique of the knife-twist.\\xa0 By the time he had his picture, I had an arm curled around mine.\\xa0 I put the long side of the knife\\u2019s edge against the glass, and began playing it as one might a violin.</p>\\n<p>Jamie smiled as he realized what I was doing, but as our eyes met, he flinched and turned forward, progressing up the stairs a few steps.</p>\\n<p><em>Running away.</em></p>\\n<p>I felt like having the formula running through my veins would have helped me find the thing to say and do.\\xa0 Not just for Jamie, to bring things back to normal, to get him to look at me and talk to me in the right way, but for myself.</p>\\n<p>I was hurt, and I was angry.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d blown it off in that cavalier, casual way, but he\\u2019d <em>had</em> to have known he was throwing a wrench into things.\\xa0 He was complicating how he and I interacted and he\\u2019d done it when I\\u2019d been confiding how uncertain I was about the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d never been good at timing, but that was pretty frigging ugly timing.</p>\\n<p>Helen signaled.\\xa0 We moved up the bend in the stairs.\\xa0 In my agitation, I was moving the knife more dramatically.\\xa0 As the texture of the glass changed, with regular, fierce scratches, I moved the knife further along the portrait.\\xa0 In a few minutes, I\\u2019d have to replace it.</p>\\n<p>We reached our new location at the bend in the stairs.\\xa0 We could see both up and downstairs, a large window to our back.\\xa0 It was tree branches, reaching from the floor to the ceiling far above us, glass fitted between.</p>\\n<p>I signaled for Lillian to approach.\\xa0 Half the soldiers tramped forward to a point halfway up the stairs.\\xa0 Lillian came with the second half.</p>\\n<p>I used the knife on the window while I waited, to prolong the life of the portrait I held.</p>\\n<p>Above us, Helen relayed Gordon\\u2019s signals.\\xa0 <em>Clear</em>.\\xa0 Fist clenched.\\xa0 <em>Clear.\\xa0 </em>Fist clenched.</p>\\n<p>Punctuating each check.</p>\\n<p>If Gordon saw the ghosts, it was either because they wanted to be found, or the scratching of glass was working.</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s other hand went up, head turning as she threw herself against the wall.\\xa0 Thumb and pinky extended, touching nose and ear.\\xa0 The hand pulled away, already forming the next gesture.\\xa0 All five fingers pointed skyward, as if she were clutching a ball.</p>\\n<p><em>Smell.\\xa0 Hear.\\xa0 Fire.</em></p>\\n<p>She had only just formed the gesture when the ghost stepped out at the very top of the stairwell.\\xa0 She was wearing an Academy uniform, but her hair was brown, her form petite, and I recognized the face as one of the ghosts we\\u2019d fought.</p>\\n<p>Helen hit the ground, chest flat against the stair she\\u2019d been standing on, hands over her head.</p>\\n<p>She had her eyes narrowed, flinching visibly with eyelids twitching as I brought the knife down the pane of the window, ready to throw it if I had to.</p>\\n<p>But she was already making the necessary motions, throwing a bottle with a rag stuffed in the end.</p>\\n<p><em>Helen\\u2019s Flame</em>.</p>\\n<p>The weapon sailed through the air, an underarm toss, not necessarily hard enough to break the bottle.\\xa0 The long drop down to us would do it.\\xa0 Jamie wouldn\\u2019t be quick enough to get out of the way.</p>\\n<p>The portrait fell from my hand.\\xa0 I leaped forward, bringing both feet up, knees to my chest.\\xa0 I set my feet on the railing, then extended my legs, pushing myself up as high and fast as I could go, reaching up and over my head.</p>\\n<p>I touched the glass of the bottle, but I was too short to actually grab it, my hand too small.\\xa0 I saw a glimpse of Jamie beneath me.</p>\\n<p>The touch made the bottle spin in the air.\\xa0 My arms windmilling, I brought my other arm forward.\\xa0 Knife still in hand, I reached over my head to stab the flaming cloth.</p>\\n<p>I followed through with the motion, bringing my arm down, sharp and away.\\xa0 The bottle shattered against the wood and glass of the window-covered wall, and the knife with the flaming rag flew off onto higher stairs.</p>\\n<p>I landed, hard, amid the spatter of caustic chemical and broken shards of glass.\\xa0 I barked out something of a cough, and my next attempt at drawing in air didn\\u2019t seem to draw in enough.\\xa0 Each subsequent breath was better.</p>\\n<p>Jamie had barely moved.\\xa0 His eyes were wide.</p>\\n<p>I panted for breath, getting a nice reserve of air back into my lungs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 He extended a hand.\\xa0 I was already grabbing onto the window for a grip, and opted to follow through, using it to stand.</p>\\n<p>I regretted it the instant I saw his expression.\\xa0 Nothing obvious, but a flicker of pain.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m okay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I felt the need to do something more, and reached out, bumping his shoulder with my fist, a light punch.\\xa0 I sort of repeated myself, but I was saying something very different as I looked around at the spatter of chemical on us and the stairs, the glass, and the burning rag, well out of the spatter\\u2019s range.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said, and it didn\\u2019t sound like he agreed.</p>\\n<p>I turned away, signaling Helen.\\xa0 <em>Good alert.</em></p>\\n<p>She nodded, stepping down two stairs to stamp on the rag.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeems like you\\u2019ve still got a little Wyvern formula in you,\\u201d Jamie murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s enough, I hope,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I was still far from baseline.\\xa0 I was glad I wasn\\u2019t on the same level as a boy my age without any of the drug\\u2019s effects.\\xa0 I\\u2019d only been there once, and it had been much, much worse.\\xa0 I still had the skills I\\u2019d picked up.\\xa0 My personality was still mine.\\xa0 My analytical way of thinking hadn\\u2019t changed, even if the edge was gone and the focus wasn\\u2019t all there.</p>\\n<p>But I wasn\\u2019t wholly <em>there</em> either.\\xa0 There was fog, blurriness around the edges of thoughts if I didn\\u2019t commit to them, and there was sloppiness.\\xa0 I was legitimately worried that I would try something and I would find I didn\\u2019t have the ability.</p>\\n<p>I signaled the a-ok to Lillian, who was staring up at me from the midst of her sea of stitched soldiers.\\xa0 I saw her hand go up, passing on the message, while her expression didn\\u2019t change, her eyes not leaving me.</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, Helen was relaying Gordon\\u2019s signals from upstairs.\\xa0 He was on the floor above, and according to him, there was more fire.</p>\\n<p>Fire had long been the go-to tool against the Academy.\\xa0 Now Claret Hall burned.</p>\\n<p><em>If we let the place burn with the exits sealed, will she burn with this place?\\xa0 </em>It was so easy an option, but the Duke had given his order.\\xa0 If she wasn\\u2019t captured alive, then we lost our one chance to get information on Percy\\u2019s plans.</p>\\n<p>Forcing the other guy to rush, as I\\u2019d often observed, was a critical part of a con man\\u2019s ploys.\\xa0 It gave the target less time to think, and it gave them more opportunity to make mistakes.\\xa0 Avis was forcing us to rush to reach her if we didn\\u2019t want her to burn alive.</p>\\n<p>That, or she was hoping to utilize the chaos and confusion native to fire and escape another way.</p>\\n<p><em>Hurry</em>, I signaled Helen and Lillian both, making sure to look at each so they knew.</p>\\n<p>The rotations, movements, and relayed orders came faster than before.\\xa0 One group wasn\\u2019t wholly in position when we started moving up the next.\\xa0 Jamie and I moved up to where Helen had dropped to the stair, then further down the hallway.</p>\\n<p>The stairs above where we\\u2019d been were on fire.</p>\\n<p>There were any number of offices in this hallway, each one with windows looking in at the hallway, and windows looking out.\\xa0 Just around the corner from where Gordon was was the vantage point we\\u2019d used to spy on his conversation with Shipman. Because the building was a square, the hallway ringing it, there was plenty of space for a set of rooms in the center of it all, these ones had windows for us to see within, the bottom of each sitting at shoulder level for me.\\xa0 A reference library, a room with a long table and many chairs, a tea room, all of which were littered with bleeding corpses.\\xa0 Each had windows that failed to give us a view of the ghosts, and each had multiple doors, so one could pass from any point in the hallway or pass from room to room.</p>\\n<p>The fire Gordon had signaled us about was at the opposite end of the building.\\xa0 Around two corners, or through the room with the table and chairs.\\xa0 It seemed strategically set to limit access to the upstairs, the flames set on and around the only other set of stairs.\\xa0 Wood burned but didn\\u2019t ignite.\\xa0 The designers of the Academy weren\\u2019t so stupid as to make the building well and truly <em>flammable</em>.</p>\\n<p>That said, while I imagined the wood had been treated to make it less likely, I wasn\\u2019t sure it was impossible for a proper blaze to take hold.\\xa0 If it was only the surface of the wood that was treated, or only the floorboards, then there was a risk.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d left us no apparent way up, short of quenching the fire.</p>\\n<p>If it weren\\u2019t for the windows that seemed to be everywhere, I might have said it was the best possible environment for our enemy to be fighting in.\\xa0 Too many avenues for access and escape.\\xa0 Two strides in any direction meant passing a door that a ghost could be lurking behind.</p>\\n<p>I could see Gordon, further down the hallway, using a knife to cut what must have been a wire.\\xa0 Through the windows that looked into and out of the rooms at the center of the building.</p>\\n<p>I continued to play my glass violin, watching, trying to get a sense of what the enemy was doing.</p>\\n<p>Gordon shifted his grip on his knife.\\xa0 He raised his free hand, giving Helen the signal.</p>\\n<p><em>Move up.</em></p>\\n<p>Yet he hadn\\u2019t budged.</p>\\n<p>I passed information to the soldiers further downstairs.\\xa0 They moved up to our position, we moved to Helen\\u2019s-</p>\\n<p>A woman in an Academy uniform stepped out of the doorway just behind where Helen had been standing.\\xa0 She was so fast in turning up that she must have been only a stride away from Helen, separated by the door and doorframe.</p>\\n<p>She was silent, graceful, and only momentarily acknowledged our existence with a glance before approaching Helen\\u2019s back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen!\\u201d I shouted.\\xa0 A white-knuckle grip on my knife, I raked the blade against the glass of the portrait, cracking the glass.\\xa0 I saw the woman falter.</p>\\n<p>Jamie threw a knife.\\xa0 It hit the woman in the lower back, right where the kidneys ought to be.</p>\\n<p>Helen was turning, and as the ghost stumbled forward, Helen wrapped her arms around her in a hug.\\xa0 The two of them tumbled to the ground.\\xa0 Helen let the ghost\\u2019s hand swipe at her face, and a stripe of crimson marked Helen\\u2019s chin.</p>\\n<p>Helen lay on top of the ghost.\\xa0 As the ghost tried to sit up, Helen slid up, forehead coming down, ass going up, standing on the woman\\u2019s pelvis on tiptoes so the entirety of her body weight was pressing down on the woman\\u2019s head.\\xa0 Her hands slapped out, grabbing for the woman\\u2019s wrists.\\xa0 She brought her head up, and slowly but surely, she brought the woman\\u2019s arms across her chest, until the arms formed an \\u2018x\\u2019, breasts squished together between them.</p>\\n<p>Another shift of grip, reversing her hold on the ghost\\u2019s wrists, and the arms were now being strained, the hard end of one elbow pressing against the hard end of the other, both straining the wrong way.\\xa0 The woman bucked and tried to throw herself to one side to hurl Helen off, but Helen\\u2019s feet went out, bracing on the floor to either side.</p>\\n<p>As bone and cartilage audibly cracked, Helen let the destroyed arm fall, grabbing the other in two hands.\\xa0 One twist and maneuver, and she twisted the shoulder from the socket.\\xa0 The woman reacted, twisting and struggling to pull away, and Helen brought the dislocated arm up and around, strangling the woman with her own arm, while the arm with the broken elbow flopped ineffectually.</p>\\n<p>More ghosts were coming from the other end of the hall, no doubt reacting to the screams.\\xa0 Gordon to the right of us, a herd of ghosts to the left.</p>\\n<p>I signaled for the soldiers below us.\\xa0 <em>Move up.\\xa0 Hurry.</em></p>\\n<p>Jamie was only a half-step behind me as I made a beeline for Helen.\\xa0 I saw the blade jutting out of the woman\\u2019s back and kicked it, driving it in as deep as it would go, before stabbing with my own knife.\\xa0 Helen glanced at me over her shoulder as I stabbed over and over, taking advantage of how Helen was holding the woman still.\\xa0 One after another, the slices went between the ribs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know we promised!\\xa0 We\\u2019ll let you have fun another time!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave the woman one last stab before turning to face the assailants.</p>\\n<p>They were gone.</p>\\n<p>Too many doors here.\\xa0 Too easy for them to fade away.</p>\\n<p>Helen had moved up to Gordon, and was crouched at his side, while he was crouched over himself.\\xa0 The soldiers were at the top of the stairs, weapons out, on the alert.</p>\\n<p>My portrait was cracked.\\xa0 I decided to make use of the windows that were so omnipresent here.</p>\\n<p>I reached for one with my knife, and it shattered a moment before I got there.\\xa0 I reached for the next nearest one, and saw a shadow of movement on the other side.\\xa0 I pulled away instead, before she could lash out or grab me.</p>\\n<p>Windows at the end of the hallway opposite Gordon broke.\\xa0 Then, like a cascade effect, they began to break one by one, the progression leading in Gordon\\u2019s direction.\\xa0 Thrown objects and coordinated movement.\\xa0 We\\u2019d let our guard down, and we hadn\\u2019t been keeping up the sharp noises to throw them off.</p>\\n<p>No, Jamie had.</p>\\n<p>They were getting used to it.</p>\\n<p>Now they were removing the options, they were heading Gordon\\u2019s way, and whatever he was saying or doing with Helen, neither of the two were moving.</p>\\n<p><em>No</em>, I thought.\\xa0 I was falling into the sway of things.\\xa0 Under pressure, time cut short by the threat of the fire, I was taking mental shortcuts and jumping to conclusions.</p>\\n<p><em>Leading the eye one way, while acting to take advantage of an enemy with their backs turned</em>.</p>\\n<p>I signaled, touching my chest, then raising my hand, changing the angle-</p>\\n<p><em>Behind me</em>.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I turned simultaneously.\\xa0 Lillian gave the order.\\xa0 \\u201cTurn left and fire!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The ghosts were only just stepping out of doorways as we turned around and the words left Lillian\\u2019s mouth.\\xa0 They moved as if it had been the plan all along, leaping for cover.</p>\\n<p>The stitched with the guns fired.\\xa0 In the enclosed space, my ears already ringing from the sound of glass breaking, the gunfire was as violent a sound as I\\u2019d ever heard.\\xa0 Bullets punctured the walls below each window, they penetrated doors, and they broke the smaller branches off of the window frames that no longer had glass in them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop!\\u201d Lillian shouted.</p>\\n<p>The stitched ceased firing, though they hurried to fix up and reload their guns.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid we get \\u2019em?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 He backed away a step.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI smell blood,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cGot <em>some</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I hoped there weren\\u2019t any people hiding in those offices and in that end of the library.\\xa0 Or that we hadn\\u2019t just executed people who the ghosts had left behind.\\xa0 Too big a chance that some were slowly bleeding out but not yet dead.</p>\\n<p>No, I had to stay focused.</p>\\n<p><em>Fixate on the enemy, Sy.\\xa0 They know what we\\u2019re doing as we do it.\\xa0 What\\u2019s their counterplay?</em></p>\\n<p>Gordon.\\xa0 Helen.</p>\\n<p>I spun around.</p>\\n<p>I saw nothing beyond the two Lambs.\\xa0 The pair were still hunched over.\\xa0 Helen was crouched over like she was prepared to pounce at any second.</p>\\n<p><em>These ghosts follow rules.\\xa0 Move away from danger.\\xa0 Capitalize on the weak.</em></p>\\n<p>There was no easy passage between the offices that were set against the external walls of the building.\\xa0 There <em>was</em> passage between the library, conference room and the tea room.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLil!\\xa0 Jamie!\\u201d I shouted.\\xa0 \\u201cPlay me a song!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d Lillian asked me.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd don\\u2019t call me Lil!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>But Jamie was already showing her how he was using the knife on the glass.</p>\\n<p>I was halfway to Gordon and Helen when the <em>stitched</em> began rubbing glass against bayonet blades, the edges of the broken shards of glass cutting into fingers.\\xa0 A cacophony of discordant sound.</p>\\n<p><em>Where are they?\\xa0 How are they moving?</em></p>\\n<p>As I got closer to the tea room, I could see through the window and make out where furniture was.</p>\\n<p>I raised a hand, warning, not looking at Gordon and Helen.</p>\\n<p>Then gestured.\\xa0 <em>Stop</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop!\\u201d Lillian called out.</p>\\n<p>The stitched obeyed.</p>\\n<p>My footsteps slapped against wood.\\xa0 One step, two steps, three steps.</p>\\n<p>Another signal.\\xa0 <em>Go!</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo!\\xa0 Start!\\xa0 Use the glass!\\u201d Lillian gave the order.</p>\\n<p>Another step, as the sound resumed, audible even to me, scratching and screeching.</p>\\n<p>I took one more step, then dropped, sliding on the floor as I reversed direction, my shoulder, side and hip touching the wall beneath the window.</p>\\n<p>I headed for a door I\\u2019d already passed, grabbing the frame as I slipped into the tea room.</p>\\n<p>A full six of them were there, crouched, poised, waiting, using furniture and the low wall beneath the window to hide, each of them in the position a sprinter maintained pre-run.\\xa0 All amid chairs and round tables, each table furnished with kettles and little bowls of tea bags.\\xa0 There were pastries and baked goods here and there on plates.</p>\\n<p>With the cacophony of noise affecting their clarity of echolocation, it took them a full second to register my approach, as I threw myself at the full group of them.</p>\\n<p>Knife in hand, blade pointing down, I swung down and at an angle.\\xa0 I nearly lost the knife as it caught on the front of one of the ghost\\u2019s throats.</p>\\n<p><em>I\\u2019m shit in a fight, but that\\u2019s all the more reason to keep it from being one</em>.</p>\\n<p>As fast as I\\u2019d been to get close to them, I reversed direction, heading for the door.\\xa0 I threw the knife, and this time, I was pleased to note, the person I was throwing at had to move to avoid getting hit.</p>\\n<p>I was in such a hurry to get out of the tea room that I fell over on passing through the threshold of the door.\\xa0 I watched the ghost I\\u2019d cut gurgle.\\xa0 She clutched at the wound on her throat and she wasn\\u2019t able to stop the blood from flowing out.</p>\\n<p>They rose up as if they were buoyed by some force I couldn\\u2019t see, puppets on strings, or stitched in the first moment they were given power, all as one, a collective.\\xa0 Each and every one bristled with hostility, the stress of the glass noises clear in their faces.</p>\\n<p>I rolled to one side, so they could no longer see me through the doorway, expecting them to come lunging out, swarming atop me.</p>\\n<p>They didn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>I met Gordon and Helen\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 I grinned.\\xa0 \\u201cGot one.\\xa0 Using their own damn tactics against them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>No congratulations seemed to be in order.\\xa0 Gordon\\u2019s expression was tight, and Helen\\u2019s expression was dead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>She gestured, and it was a signal I hadn\\u2019t seen before, though the meaning was clear.\\xa0 Fingers crossed, she touched her heart.</p>\\n<p>Dog had mentioned it.\\xa0 Gordon had gone ahead.</p>\\n<p>I nearly snarled with the emotions that hit me then.\\xa0 Instead, I made a face, turning away, reaching for another knife.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sucking right now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou always suck, Gordon,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAt least you have an excuse this time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re an ass, Sy,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you\\u2019re broken.\\xa0 But tomorrow you\\u2019ll be fixed and I\\u2019ll still be an ass, so there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not how that goes, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The ghosts still hadn\\u2019t attacked.\\xa0 I had to judge what they were doing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026And I don\\u2019t know how fixable this is,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey implied this was my last heart.\\xa0 Adding another is going to tax my body too much.\\xa0 I-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnough of that,\\u201d I cut him off.\\xa0 My voice was tense.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 Job to do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Figuring out where the ghosts were went hand in hand with figuring out why they hadn\\u2019t retaliated.\\xa0 I figured both out as I looked back to check on Lillian and Jamie.</p>\\n<p>The Duke.\\xa0 He\\u2019d emerged at the top of the stairs.</p>\\n<p>Everyone else, stitched included, was crouched over, keeping low to the ground.\\xa0 It made us all harder to see, and it meant the enemy couldn\\u2019t reach through a broken window to attack or grab.\\xa0 The Duke didn\\u2019t care about either.\\xa0 He stood tall, surveying the situation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve stopped,\\u201d he said, his voice carrying down the hall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFire in the way, and we\\u2019re kind of busy killing these guys and trying not to die,\\u201d I said, the words escaping my lips.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Sy</em>,\\u201d Gordon said, voice soft.</p>\\n<p>But I saw the change in the Duke\\u2019s expression.\\xa0 He approached, footsteps heavy and swift, coat moving behind him.\\xa0 I had the impression of an onrushing train, and I was stuck on the tracks.</p>\\n<p>It was a ghost that saved me.\\xa0 She approached from the room with the table, leaping through the shattered window, straight for the Duke.</p>\\n<p>He saw her and he turned, one hand reaching out.\\xa0 She contorted in the air, twisting just out of his reach, before landing on the wooden floorboards with both hands and both feet.</p>\\n<p>The Duke drew his sword and cut in the same motion.\\xa0 She slipped out of the way of that strike as well.</p>\\n<p>His pistol fired without even leaving the holster.\\xa0 His hand had come down, he\\u2019d pressed the hammer down and adjusted the angle, while touching the trigger in the same motion.\\xa0 She\\u2019d already danced to one side.\\xa0 He fired twice more from the hip, before drawing the pistol and firing three more times.\\xa0 At the end of the hall, Jamie and Lillian threw themselves flat to the ground to avoid getting hit by one of the stray bullets.\\xa0 Lillian shrieked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm,\\u201d the Duke made an amused sound.\\xa0 He sheathed his sword, then reached to his belt before sliding bullets into his pistol.\\xa0 The ghost took the opportunity to duck through a doorway, running through the conference room with its long table and many chairs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou see what we\\u2019re up against, my lord,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do see,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He drew closer, and put one finger under my chin.\\xa0 He offered only the lightest touch, but I still rose to my feet.\\xa0 He spoke, \\u201cI also <em>heard</em> the insolence in your tone.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll remember it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart skipped a beat in time with the click of his pistol, as he closed it up and cocked the hammer, just a foot from my head.\\xa0 He tossed it into the air and caught it with his other hand.</p>\\n<p>Then, so suddenly I wasn\\u2019t sure I\\u2019d processed it right, he grabbed one of the sections of window frame with only scant glass shards remaining, and carried through on the movement to hurl it violently across the tea room.\\xa0 It crashed through the window there.</p>\\n<p>I only barely saw the ghost move, abandoning her cover where she\\u2019d been standing.\\xa0 The Duke\\u2019s arm was already extended, pistol pointing.\\xa0 In the eyeblink the ghost\\u2019s head was visible, he put a bullet through it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm,\\u201d he made that amused sound again.</p>\\n<p>He walked past me, and he did it in a roundabout way that had the pistol in his hand touch my face.\\xa0 It traced along cheekbone, catching on the ridge of my nose, and then stopping there, between my eyes, before he moved on.\\xa0 He was tall enough he didn\\u2019t even need to move his arm or change the angle of his wrist to do it.\\xa0 His arm hanging down at his side put his hand at eye level for me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI heard you say that you killed the one,\\u201d he said, as he walked away, \\u201cLying on the floor, throat cut?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy isn\\u2019t normally-\\u201d Gordon started.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re <em>not</em> the one I asked.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI am, lord,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I figured formalities couldn\\u2019t hurt, given circumstances.</p>\\n<p>There was no response, nor any explanation over the question.\\xa0 Or perhaps the question was the response.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe fire is barring your way?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t asking me, Gordon, or Helen.\\xa0 He was talking to Jamie and Lillian.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 He stepped into the conference room.</p>\\n<p>Helen and I gave Gordon a hand in standing, and I was a little surprised at how much help he needed.\\xa0 He was sweating a little.</p>\\n<p>As a trio, we approached.\\xa0 I could see Mary at the center of the group, with Jamie and Lillian.\\xa0 She looked better than Gordon did.</p>\\n<p>Wood scraped against wood, a haunting, awful sound.\\xa0 The long table looked like it could sit eighteen, the wood of the tabletop two inches thick and very probably dense.\\xa0 Rather than legs, it had boards of the same thickness at two ends, poised diagonally.\\xa0 The Duke pushed it across the floor, out the double doors on the far end of the conference room, until it sat beside the fire that stood between us and the stairs.</p>\\n<p>Broad shoulders strained as he tilted it.\\xa0 The table fell on its side.\\xa0 Another turn, and it landed upside-down.\\xa0 The heavy table\\u2019s top squashed the fire and sent licks of the flaming chemical dancing over hardwood.</p>\\n<p>He raised his pistol and fired down the length of the hall, toward the tea room.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cStay with Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>The Duke turned to set his eyes on us.</p>\\n<p>We wasted no time.\\xa0 The herd of stitched followed, with Lillian at the fore of the group with two handlers and Gordon and Mary at the rear.</p>\\n<p>As I passed the Duke, stepping on the underside of the table, he moved.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t remain with Mary, this time, but fell into step, just behind me, with Helen to our left and Jamie to our right.</p>\\n<p>I looked back at the others, for feedback, or clarity.\\xa0 As if someone could provide some sanity to this mad situation.\\xa0 Instead, I saw the shadow of a ghost moving across the hall, in the direction of the opposite stairwell.</p>\\n<p>There was no firebomb waiting for us this time.\\xa0 A good thing, considering Jamie and I were doused in flammable chemicals.\\xa0 We reached the third floor of the building, and came face to face with stitched.\\xa0 None of the four were armed.\\xa0 None even appeared hostile.</p>\\n<p>But each one had a conspicuous hole in its midsection.\\xa0 Intestines scooped out, they had empty cavities within, large enough to hide a human head inside.\\xa0 Some cavities had different shapes to them, as if they\\u2019d settled around whatever they\\u2019d been holding.</p>\\n<p>That was a <em>bad</em> thing, as things went.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d been assuming she had something small, for her countermeasure.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Duke,\\u201d Avis\\u2019 voice carried.\\xa0 \\u201cShould I be honored?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis will go easier if you\\u2019ll turn yourself in,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI sincerely doubt that.\\xa0 I\\u2019m doomed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou are,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut your extended family doesn\\u2019t need to be.\\xa0 I know you have a sister.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI already sent the bird out.\\xa0 Whoever you send, whatever message you try to get to your subordinates, it\\u2019ll be too late.\\xa0 She\\u2019ll be gone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll have to get creative, it seems.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo it seems,\\u201d Avis said.</p>\\n<p>Her voice sounded sad.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know you can\\u2019t kill me,\\u201d the Duke said, as he stepped into the hallway.\\xa0 He very casually put a sword through the throat of one stitched, then swiped it to one side, beheading the other three.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can try.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm,\\u201d the Duke made an amused sound.</p>\\n<p>I replayed her voice in my head, those last three words, and I couldn\\u2019t say why, but I suspected she didn\\u2019t believe she had a chance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been preparing for this eventuality for years,\\u201d Avis said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been prepared for any eventuality since birth,\\u201d the Duke said, very quietly.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re building something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBuilt.\\xa0 It\\u2019s done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo it\\u2019s not.\\xa0 You\\u2019re biding your time,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He advanced further into the third floor.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs, too, climbed a little higher.\\xa0 I could see across the floor, now.\\xa0 A lot of open space.\\xa0 There were few walls, and the floor sat in a depression, the staggered steps down doubling as seats or benches, with pillows here and there.</p>\\n<p>A social area.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m done building,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m just having a drink.\\xa0 It\\u2019s taking a few goes to get all of it down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA combat drug,\\u201d Lillian whispered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever you need to do,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 He smiled, as he picked his way around the staggered steps.\\xa0 He leaned his head one way, to try and look beyond the wall that only extended partway down the room.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m hoping for a good contest.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cContest?\\u201d Avis asked, and her voice sounded <em>different</em>.\\xa0 \\u201cNever.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was an echo of a thought that had passed through my head as I\\u2019d cut the ghost\\u2019s throat.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t even see the catalyst.\\xa0 The depression in the floor <em>ignited</em>, the deepest part filling up with fire, clearly filled with an odorless accelerant of some kind.\\xa0 Stripes of flame swept up the stairs to each corner of the room, separating it into four quadrants, the Duke cut off from us.</p>\\n<p>The sound of glass shattering and the roar of flame below us suggested our retreat was being cut off.</p>\\n<p>I fought to keep my breathing under control, my thoughts in focus, and the <em>sound</em> didn\\u2019t help in the slightest.\\xa0 The Duke was chuckling, and the chuckle became a laugh.\\xa0 He stood with flames within feet of him, arms spread, weapons in hand.</p>\\n<p>We didn\\u2019t even matter.\\xa0 This fight, this scenario, it was all for <em>him.</em></p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/06/lamb-to-the-slaughter-6-11/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Our approach as a group was somewhat staggered, as Lambs came in ones and twos to kneel before the Duke.\\xa0 Jamie first, then me a few seconds later, then Helen and Lillian as a pair, Gordon and Mary, with Gordon helping Mary ease down to her knees as he knelt himself.\\xa0 Dog didn\\u2019t kneel, but there were anatomical issues there. He bowed his head instead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStand,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p>We stood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI heard you left as a group.\\xa0 I asked to be notified the moment you were seen returning,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cDog, Catcher, it is nice to put faces to the names.\\xa0 Faces that aren\\u2019t from medical sketches, at least.\\xa0 From the injuries, I assume you found something out?\\xa0 Gordon, speak.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLord, there are at least twelve of the enhanced clones in the city.\\xa0 We found their base of operations with Catcher\\u2019s help.\\xa0 We couldn\\u2019t run down the clones, but we killed three and captured a different type of clone.\\xa0 Percy\\u2019s.\\xa0 They\\u2019re in the rear hatch of the carriage.\\xa0 Three rescued children are within the carriage itself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Duke indicated the carriage with a hand.\\xa0 Soldiers and one doctor approached it.\\xa0 \\u201cContinue.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s distributed the clones to several cities or several points in this city, my lord, with his own clones producing further generations.\\xa0 They\\u2019re taking a viral approach.\\xa0 Occupying our cities, proliferating within, then spreading.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Duke remained very quiet for a moment.\\xa0 Not a single person present dared speak.\\xa0 Many of the people on the road around the Academy campus were keeping their heads down, sharply aware of the Duke\\u2019s presence.\\xa0 People a third of the way across the Academy grounds probably sensed the shift in tempo and focus, all rippling from this one location.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow severe a problem do you believe it is?\\u201d the Duke asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAt this stage, it might be manageable, my lord.\\xa0 They won\\u2019t have spread very far in the last year.\\xa0 They might only be working on the second generation now, but that could mean ten to twenty sites.\\xa0 Individually, they\\u2019re dangerous, they have incredible amounts of spatial awareness and tracking ability.\\xa0 They are training themselves in combat, but their ability isn\\u2019t high.\\xa0 Not yet.\\xa0 They rely more on their natural ability, their environment, and picking the place and time of their attacks to win.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis ability?\\u201d\\xa0 The Duke cut in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLord, we think it\\u2019s echolocation, derived from the escaped experiment we named \\u2018Whiskers\\u2019.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know the one you\\u2019re talking about,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p>I was a little bit surprised at that.\\xa0 I was a little more concerned that Gordon hadn\\u2019t had the chance to finish speaking.</p>\\n<p>He watched as people emerged from the carriage.\\xa0 Stitched soldiers carried one corpse each, and two more held the captive.\\xa0\\xa0 High quality stitched.\\xa0 Elite guard?</p>\\n<p>My eye passed over Jamie as it turned forward again.\\xa0 He was looking at me.</p>\\n<p>I felt uncomfortable.\\xa0 It was a very hard uncomfortable to put my finger on and identify.\\xa0 I felt angry more than anything.</p>\\n<p>Anger was a bad emotion here, so close to the Duke.</p>\\n<p>The silence lingered as the Duke seemed to take it in.\\xa0 Nobody was permitted to speak without permission, and there was more to say.\\xa0 It felt uncomfortable, having the things left unsaid hanging over our heads.</p>\\n<p>I could tell how the conversation was going to go.\\xa0 I could play it through in my head, muddy as it was, and I could see several ways it could go poorly.\\xa0 We weren\\u2019t used to being around the nobility, and Gordon had made a tactical error.\\xa0 He hadn\\u2019t divulged the most critical, dangerous information, and now he wouldn\\u2019t get a chance to do it without being rude.\\xa0 Being rude could have repercussions.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is effective work,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll allot you some time to rest and heal before assigning you another job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, my lord,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord,\\u201d I said, quickly.\\xa0 I spoke at the same time I raised my eyes and saw the ruling body of Radham opening <em>his</em> mouth to speak.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 His tone had the faintest hint of danger as he said, \\u201cYou seem eager to speak.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t waste our time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLord Duke, there\\u2019s another facet to this that needs mention.\\xa0 They were using Academy resources.\\xa0 Vats, chemicals, uniforms, this carriage, chemicals, and very possibly communication.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCommunication?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord, it\\u2019s only speculation, but they were using birds.\\xa0 They tried to burn the cage and their papers as Dog and Gordon made their approach.\\xa0 I only recovered remains of the cage.\\xa0 There are no guarantees, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t meet his eyes, but I was aware of how he was moving and how he stood.\\xa0 He seemed to assert himself, straightening.\\xa0 He began pacing.</p>\\n<p>Having the Duke pacing before us was nerve-wracking.\\xa0 He was moving his hand, as if to punctuate thoughts he wasn\\u2019t sharing with us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour captive,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe clone of Percy.\\xa0 Will he respond to interrogation?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe didn\\u2019t for us, my lord,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>It was going out on a limb, to speak when I had the Duke\\u2019s attention.\\xa0 Had Gordon simply let me continue to hold the conversation, he faced a heck of a lot less risk.\\xa0 Now we risked sharing it, either as a pair or all of the Lambs together.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut he can speak?\\xa0 He\\u2019s capable of reacting to cues?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen there is almost certainly a way,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 He turned to one of his doctors, gesturing with one hand.\\xa0 The man departed.\\xa0 The Duke spoke again when the man was only a few steps away.\\xa0 \\u201cDobson?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord?\\u201d\\xa0 The doctor stopped.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe thought crossed my mind in relation to this interrogation.\\xa0 Professor Briggs managed Radham Academy before my arrival.\\xa0 While you\\u2019re making arrangements for the clone, have Professor Briggs detained and rendered to the labs as fodder for testing.\\xa0 It should be made absolutely clear to him that I\\u2019m displeased at the number of mistakes that were made under his watch.\\xa0 Give his wife and child a payment to give them time to get their feet under them.\\xa0 Allow him to say his goodbyes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou may go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Duke turned his back as his doctor disappeared into Claret Hall.\\xa0 The team at the gates didn\\u2019t dare slow the man on his errand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t like doing that,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt makes me uncomfortable.\\xa0 I worry I\\u2019ll have to do it several more times today, as I look into this <em>infestation</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was still pacing, periodically gesticulating.</p>\\n<p>My mouth was dry.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d he said, coming to a complete stop as he whirled on me.\\xa0 His coat flared behind him.\\xa0 His eyes fixed mine, wild with too much white around them.\\xa0 My entire body jolted with the accidental eye contact.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>No!\\xa0 No!\\xa0 </em>\\u201cI- I mean, my lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wrong word, sir was.\\xa0 Wrong, very offensive word to use when referring to a noble.</p>\\n<p>The word seemed to hang in the air.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you know the name of the woman who manages the birds and all incoming and outgoing communication in Radham?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>What?</em></p>\\n<p>Memory was Jamie\\u2019s strength.\\xa0 It was most definitely not mine.</p>\\n<p>I could have named Jamie, could have said something, but then the agitated, upset Duke would be focusing on him.\\xa0 Whatever weirdness Jamie had brought up, even if he\\u2019d changed the paradigm between us, I wasn\\u2019t about to do that to him.\\xa0 No, especially now, I wasn\\u2019t willing to.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know, my lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAvis Pardoe,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe manages the phone bank, and she looks after the birds who transmit more secure messages.\\xa0 She was subtle, to work against us like this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord.\\xa0 I know the person, the name escaped me, I\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 A little too fast, all together.\\xa0 I might as well have been rambling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI last saw her in Claret Hall, right behind me,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 He straightened a little.\\xa0 He still gestured, his eyes moving in a way that reminded me of Mary\\u2019s, earlier.\\xa0 \\u201cDog, Catcher.\\xa0 You were just in active duty, and you assisted the Lambs.\\xa0 I would not begrudge you if you said you weren\\u2019t in fighting form.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cI am able and willing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor the time being, we\\u2019ll dispense of formalities,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cI won\\u2019t brook disrespect or disobeyed orders, but there\\u2019s no need for titles.\\xa0 Foley, I want available forces to converge here.\\xa0 Cut off escape routes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>What was he doing?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not sure I understand,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen I\\u2019ll explain what <em>I</em> know.\\xa0 After our last discussion, I had the men at the entrance to Radham Academy questioned about these women you described.\\xa0 Off-duty soldiers have been partaking of the services of some ladies of the evening.\\xa0 They were recognized, and while thoroughly frisked, they thought that a professor or, ahem, a <em>dignitary</em> had arranged for the women to come visit.\\xa0 As of right now, by their recollection, two such women entered Radham and have not yet left.\\xa0 Did you intercept the bird leaving the enemy\\u2019s headquarters?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, my lord,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure if there was a bird.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAvis Pardoe may have received a warning.\\xa0 If she\\u2019s not already running, she\\u2019s braced for us to come after her.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll enter and move through the building.\\xa0 The other usable weapons of Radham Academy are out of the city or preoccupied.\\xa0 The uninjured Lambs will address this, in addition to Dog and Catcher and every able bodied man I can summon.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll lead the capture.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>He\\u2019ll lead?</em></p>\\n<p>That spooked me more than anything Avis could bring to bear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo what you do,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cKeep me informed, relay information back to me in as timely a fashion as you can.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told you to forget the title,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt wastes time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cCatcher, take the North door?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are five non-window exits they could use to escape the building,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cNorth, West, South, the service door at the side by the garbage haul, the secret door facing the underground labs, and a hatch leading under Claret Hall.\\xa0 You can cover the secret door as well as the North door.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Hatch</em>? I thought.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure why I thought it to myself instead of asking Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat hatch?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAccessible through the wine cellar, which is below the kitchens.\\xa0 They store drinks for visitors.\\xa0 The hatch leads to a drainage tunnel.\\xa0 The tunnel collects rainwater from gutters and the plaza, where it collects in cisterns,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s ankle deep, the top of each cistern has a grate that can be walked on.\\xa0 Maybe ankle deep in water, depending on rainfall, but it was meant as an emergency exit.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know how many people know about it, but it\\u2019s in old blueprints.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere does it lead?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe underground labs.\\xa0 But if any part of the dungeon is sealed off, so is the escape tunnel.\\xa0 There are rooms offset to the tunnel, where people can hide, same construction as the labs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Claret Hall was the center and headquarters of the Academy.\\xa0 The heart.\\xa0 It was where the Duke situated himself, much of the time, and it was where the administration worked from.\\xa0 Important people who came to Radham came to Claret Hall.\\xa0 It made sense that the place was riddled with options to give those people an extra measure of security.</p>\\n<p>Catcher looked to the Duke.\\xa0 \\u201cWith your permission, we\\u2019ll do a circuit around the building, see if she\\u2019s made a run for it, loop back, and then take up position.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Duke nodded.</p>\\n<p>Catcher and Dog left, each moving in separate directions.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t be dumb, not in the sense of being mute.\\xa0 Even if I wasn\\u2019t sure how to handle the Jamie situation, I needed to communicate and figure out what was going on.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs she watching us?\\u201d I asked, looking at the building face.</p>\\n<p>Jamie responded without looking at me.\\xa0 \\u201cHer office isn\\u2019t facing us, but anyone can walk down the hall and peer out the window.\\xa0 If she got a bird with a message and she\\u2019s looking out for trouble, she might already be planning her escape.\\xa0 The secret door and the hatch are most likely.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Duke snapped his fingers, then pointed.\\xa0 The doctors who\\u2019d accompanied the Duke had little bags with wheels and handles.\\xa0 He was pointing at one bag.</p>\\n<p>It reminded me of our signals, but it was different.\\xa0 Our signals were something cooperative, that we\\u2019d devised between us as a matter of course, because it seemed only natural.\\xa0 For the Duke, he expected people to do as he bid, and people who spent any length of time around him adopted a way of thinking that involved anticipating and predicting the man every step of the way.</p>\\n<p>One doctor had opened the bag, withdrawing weapons.\\xa0 A sword, one-handed, and a pistol.\\xa0 Both were overly ornate.</p>\\n<p>The Duke stood, eyes surveying the building while the doctor strapped the weapons onto his belt.</p>\\n<p><em>If this goes wrong, and the man gets assassinated, do we all suffer the same fate Briggs did?\\xa0 Are we deemed utter failures and summarily disposed of?</em></p>\\n<p>There were more soldiers approaching.\\xa0 I could see others further along, approaching from a distance to surround the building.\\xa0 They were keeping their distance, picking positions where buildings would obscure the view.\\xa0 Somehow, knowing what the ghosts were capable of, I didn\\u2019t believe that Avis was oblivious to any of this.</p>\\n<p>The Duke only watched, listened, and reached out to stroke Helen\\u2019s hair in an absent way.</p>\\n<p>It was gratuitous force.\\xa0 A hundred armed men, Dog, Catcher, the Lambs and the Duke himself, to catch three people?</p>\\n<p>This was a man who, given the opportunity, left nothing up to chance.</p>\\n<p>With every moment that passed, I had more of a bad feeling.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t feeling sharp enough to know or say if it was because of prey instinct or if it was something else entirely.\\xa0 It could have been lingering feelings from my discussion with Jamie, about how unstable the Lambs felt at this very moment.\\xa0 We threatened to fall to pieces, and going into the fray so soon after Mary got hurt, it might have been a factor in why I felt uncertain.</p>\\n<p>If it <em>was</em> prey instinct, though, what was I noticing but not processing?\\xa0 What little details were adding up to make me feel concerned?\\xa0 There was no telling what the enemy was doing.\\xa0 There <em>was</em> the fact that the Duke was involved here and he was something of a wild card, but he wasn\\u2019t doing much more than petting Helen.</p>\\n<p>I glanced at Ibott, who had remained nearby, silent, watching, clutching hands together like the toady he was.</p>\\n<p>Helen seemed oblivious to what was going on, but I knew she wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 It was more that there was a discrete, distinct break between what she thought and felt and what she <em>did</em>.\\xa0 There was a reason she was such an effective actress.\\xa0 For the time being, she was keeping everything locked down and away, and there would be no telling what she needed or wanted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLord, my Helen can stay here,\\u201d Ibott said.</p>\\n<p>My bones felt like cold water had run through them in the wake of that statement.</p>\\n<p>I saw Gordon turn his head.\\xa0 I knew Gordon well enough to read his expression, to know what he was thinking, that he felt the same way I did.</p>\\n<p>Well, I\\u2019d established myself as someone who spoke out of turn.\\xa0 The Duke had given us permission to say what needed to be said, given that we were going into battle, I might as well use it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Ibott turned to look at me, incredulous.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019d deny her company to the Lord Duke?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne of the bodies we brought in was Helen\\u2019s kill.\\xa0 We need her at the front.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s injured, Mary can stay behind,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not your decision to make,\\u201d Ibott snapped at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p>Ibott paled a little, surprise and fear crossing his expression before he mostly composed himself.\\xa0 He bowed a little, saying, \\u201cMy lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>In straightening, he shot me a glare.</p>\\n<p>He already hated me.\\xa0 I was surprised that he hated me <em>more</em>, by the looks of things.</p>\\n<p>My mind was struggling to draw up explanations even as fast as I provided them.\\xa0 \\u201cWe Lambs push in, spreading out while remaining in contact.\\xa0 Catcher knows the hand signals.\\xa0 We keep eyes on one another, watch each other\\u2019s backs.\\xa0 Signal with right hand, relay with left.\\xa0 If you see a signal, relay it.\\xa0 As we extend in, the Duke and Mary can advance, Mary selectively informs the Duke what we\\u2019re saying and doing, keeping in mind that the Ghosts can hear us.\\xa0 The Duke, in turn, can give orders to the soldiers and stitched.\\xa0 Soldiers complement what we\\u2019re doing.\\xa0 At our signal, Dog and Catcher can move.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I glanced at Mary, who looked back my way, and there was emotion on her face.\\xa0 She was upset.\\xa0 <em>Galled,</em> to use a clever word for it.</p>\\n<p>Being left out or being told she was <em>incapable, </em>both struck to the heart of who she was, stinging her at her core.</p>\\n<p>I hated to leave her with the Duke, but it made the most sense.\\xa0 Of all of us, short of Gordon, she was the one who could deal with the man, impress him, and yet not impress him to the degree that he wanted to take a Lamb for himself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAvis knows we\\u2019re here.\\xa0 She\\u2019s got ghosts with her.\\xa0 If we leave ourselves exposed in any way, they\\u2019ll get us like they got Mary.\\xa0 But she\\u2019s a smart woman.\\xa0 Has to be, to have that position.\\xa0 I assume the Duke is using this show of force out of concern for any bioweapons or other failsafes she stashed in the event she was caught.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was a consideration,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cI trust your ability to manage it more than I trust the common soldier.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>But we\\u2019re still handling it.\\xa0 We\\u2019re walking into a building while the Birdwatcher knows there\\u2019s trouble incoming.\\xa0 She\\u2019s been working against the Academy for a long while, and she\\u2019s been fearing this day.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s been at this for a while.\\xa0 Maybe since she joined the Academy.\\xa0 She\\u2019s been fearing being caught and having the entirety of the Academy collapse in on her since day one.\\xa0 Every time she\\u2019s sent a bird out with a message intended to work <em>against</em> the Academy, she\\u2019s been fearing what might happen if it got intercepted, if the wrong person read it.\\xa0 She\\u2019s worried if someone would say the wrong word and turn her in.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a fear that eats at you and even consumes you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow interesting, to hear how people think,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cI can\\u2019t imagine living with fear.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve only experienced it a few times in my life.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWariness,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHaving to be on guard, think everything through.\\xa0 You surely experience that when you look at the maps and plot strategy for the war, my lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do.\\xa0 But I do not fear anything when I do it,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 He observed, \\u201cDog and Catcher have returned.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see them,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe thing about that fear, is I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019d be content to sit back and let it wash over her.\\xa0 You can\\u2019t be that passive and rise to the position she did.\\xa0 She\\u2019d take measures.\\xa0 It would have to be subtle, something that wouldn\\u2019t get found, and it would have to be effective.\\xa0 Something that would give her the security that there was a way out at any time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was saying this not just to elaborate on the enemy, but to convince the Duke that this was a <em>bad</em> idea.\\xa0 If he\\u2019d be willing to send someone else, or reconsider using the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA bomb would not be likely,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cPoison gas or no, we have the like of Dog and Catcher to identify something like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t considering going with another option, it seemed.</p>\\n<p>Dog and Catcher reached us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s inside,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>The bad feeling was getting worse.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA final group is getting in position,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne moment.\\xa0 Catcher, stay near.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was painfully aware of Jamie.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t communicating with me, wasn\\u2019t looking my way, wasn\\u2019t doing anything.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d let him down, I felt let down.\\xa0 It gnawed at me, and I was in a particularly distracted state, without Wyvern flowing through my brain.\\xa0 Normally, I might have turned to my best friend to confide in him and find some sense or peace in the midst of it, but I couldn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>Anxious, nervous, I broke away from the group under the pretext of looking at Claret Hall from another angle, or studying the regiment of soldiers off to one side.</p>\\n<p>I realized, belatedly, that I was making a beeline straight for Catcher.\\xa0\\xa0 Instincts at work.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t stop.</p>\\n<p>I ran my fingers through wet hair, pushing it out of my face.\\xa0 It was just damp enough to stay where I put it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you want advice about your Jamie,\\u201d Catcher said, \\u201cI\\u2019m the least qualified person to dispense it.\\xa0 Dog is better qualified, but I don\\u2019t think we have enough time to translate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d heard it all.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure what to say to that, or how to explain myself, or what I even wanted to communicate.</p>\\n<p>A full minute passed as I stood there, silent.</p>\\n<p>I saw the Duke stirring, and realized I was out of time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThanks,\\u201d I said, and it wasn\\u2019t sarcastic, and I had no idea what I was thanking Catcher for.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood luck,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I turned to go back to the others.</p>\\n<p>He gave Helen\\u2019s head another stroke, then let his hand fall to his side.\\xa0 He gripped the pommel of his one-handed sword.\\xa0 \\u201cWe capture her alive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, lord,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 My response mingled with that of the others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSoldiers in first.\\xa0 Lambs, follow alongside, then move as you suggested,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p>We were among the rank and file.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t something that I normally dwelt on, but each of the men we were working with were two to two and a half feet taller than I was.\\xa0 They loomed, all in matching uniforms, all with guns.</p>\\n<p>This wasn\\u2019t familiar ground, and I wasn\\u2019t sure I would have liked what we were doing if it was.</p>\\n<p>Feet tramped on the ground.\\xa0 The Lambs found positions between the rows and columns of stitched soldiers as they divided to enter through the two separate doors.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI lead,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen, watch my back.\\xa0 Jamie and Sy, you stick together.\\xa0 Lillian, we keep you surrounded by soldiers, advance them forward, then have you escorted up to the new group.\\xa0 Focus on the signals and relaying back to Mary and the Duke.\\xa0 Be ready with your kit in case there\\u2019s trouble.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLots of windows,\\u201d I observed.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need knives.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve got knives,\\u201d Mary said, behind us.\\xa0 Then, in response to a question I didn\\u2019t hear, she said, \\u201cThe ghosts are sensitive to high pitched sound.\\xa0 Blades against glass.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She started passing the knives up to the rest of us.\\xa0 I took three.</p>\\n<p>It was disconcerting, having the Duke following, watching our every move, judging.\\xa0 This was a man so powerful that our project continued or faced cancellation at his whim, but we were almost beneath him.\\xa0 We almost didn\\u2019t matter.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t help that he was here under the guise of leading us, but <em>we</em> were the ones devising the strategy.</p>\\n<p>The doors banged as the stitched pushed them open.\\xa0 We marched into the hallway, the rows of rifle-wielding stitched taking up so much space that bystanders were being squeezed out or pushed up against the wall.</p>\\n<p>The ground floor was shaped like a cross, with a long hallway leading to a crossroad with a desk in the middle.\\xa0 Offices and services were set off to either side of the hallway.\\xa0 Beyond the desk was the north hallway, leading to the door that Dog and Catcher watched.\\xa0 All of it was worked up in dark wood that gleamed with lacquer and resin, with gold trim and deep red woods here and there for accent.</p>\\n<p>And the people \\u2013 there were hundreds of students in the space, and as large as Claret Hall was, it made for a jumble.\\xa0 More so when they reacted to the approach of a full regiment with chaos and confusion.</p>\\n<p>The soldiers went out, checking offices to either side.\\xa0 The hand signals came out from Gordon.\\xa0 I relayed it back.\\xa0 <em>No sign.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cHear me!\\u201d the Duke proclaimed, and his voice <em>boomed</em> down the length of the hall.\\xa0 Before he was even done speaking, people were dropping to their knees.\\xa0 \\u201cBy order of the Crown, lay on the ground with your arms straight out above your head, and we will know you are no enemy of ours!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was as if an invisible wave was crashing into the crowd.\\xa0 There was no question, there was no hesitation.\\xa0 Every person in the crowded hall dropped, and many had already been in the process of kneeling or kneeling already.</p>\\n<p>Well, that was his contribution, I supposed.\\xa0 We hadn\\u2019t had the element of surprise to begin with, and now we didn\\u2019t need to worry nearly so much about the people who were lingering.</p>\\n<p>Helen raised a hand, signaling.\\xa0 <em>Escape.\\xa0 </em>She swept it out to point to people behind us.</p>\\n<p>I passed it on.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re within five paces of me or behind me, you evacuate,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p>I heard the people shuffling, scrambling to get off the ground and head for the South door.</p>\\n<p><em>Where are you, Birdwatcher</em>? I thought.</p>\\n<p>Upstairs, probably.\\xa0 With whatever weapon or tool she\\u2019d devised to quiet her fears and convince herself that she could escape when and if she got caught.</p>\\n<p>I hated the notion that she might be right.\\xa0 That she really did have an out.\\xa0 Or worse, that she <em>didn\\u2019t</em>, and that she was prepared to go out with a bang if her trick didn\\u2019t work and we ended up cornering her.</p>\\n<p>Couldn\\u2019t say no to the Duke, couldn\\u2019t retreat or take a different tack.\\xa0 His presence behind us was pushing us forward, giving us no choice but to face this, however uncertain I or we might feel.\\xa0 His advance behind us was like a pressure, pushing us forward, into deeper, uncertain waters.</p>\\n<p>I could feel the tension in my teeth, and I recognized it from before.</p>\\n<p>I snapped my fingers for the benefit of the others, then signaled.\\xa0 <em>Number.</em></p>\\n<p>Helen nodded, then touched an ear.\\xa0 She relayed to Gordon, while I made sure the others behind me knew.</p>\\n<p>Of course there were more than two.\\xa0 The sensation was already more intense than the seven had been, back when Mary got stabbed.</p>\\n<p>I listened for the order that wouldn\\u2019t come, in response to the chatter I couldn\\u2019t hear.\\xa0 My heart sank.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t order a retreat.</p>\\n<p>This had suddenly gotten a great deal more difficult.</p>\\n<p><em>We know the first card Avis is playing, now.\\xa0 All of their ghosts somehow found a way inside.</em></p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/17/enemy-arc-6/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Avis raised her head, groggy, her vision unfocused.\\xa0 Chains and bands of metal clinked.</p>\\n<p>The table she was bound to was set on a hinge so it could be laid flat, or tilted so she was standing up.\\xa0 Bars sat between toes and fingers, locking them in place, and a network of wires had been worked into her mouth and around her shaved head, locking jaw and tongue in place.\\xa0 Tubes fed clear fluids into her and drained out dark ones.\\xa0 Mechanical arms with more tubes, syringes, and other tools hung around her, poised like a dozen scorpion tails, ready to strike at her.</p>\\n<p>Her gradual struggle, waking up to find out how firmly she was bound, made for a backdrop of clinks and grunts, quickly growing more intense.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAvis,\\u201d the Duke spoke.</p>\\n<p>The noises ceased.\\xa0 Her eyes found us.\\xa0 The Duke stood, his doctors behind him.\\xa0 His wounds had been patched up, now virtually invisible, and he\\u2019d changed both shirt and coat for something less bloodstained.\\xa0 Jamie, Lillian, and I were there, Lillian beside Jamie, me off to one side, nearer the Duke, sitting on a table.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf your chest hurts,\\u201d the Duke said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s because of the day\\u2019s surgeries.\\xa0 I imagine the drug you took was intended to kill you if you didn\\u2019t take a very specific antidote, but my doctors are very good.\\xa0 You are going to live, Avis Pardoe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was breathing harder, but she wasn\\u2019t physically struggling.</p>\\n<p>He glanced at a piece of paper that sat on the corner of the same table I did.\\xa0 \\u201cCapsule embedded in your leg, I assume it would be activated with sustained flexing of the calf muscle, that has been removed.\\xa0 We have also removed, for the time being, your ability to use your thumbs and fingers independently.\\xa0 If and when we release you from your bondage, you won\\u2019t be able to stand, crawl, or make any vigorous movements without assistance.\\xa0 Should you try, your hip and shoulder joints will come free of the sockets.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He turned his attention back to her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe bonds you\\u2019re in now are a formality, and I do like formalities, Avis.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been told by my doctors that it is kinder to keep you like this, so you won\\u2019t accidentally hurt yourself.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve been given our best drugs to dull pain.\\xa0 I want you to think very clearly about things between visits.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She tried to speak.\\xa0 It was garbled by the wires in her mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou had your chance to speak earlier.\\xa0 This isn\\u2019t a stage for you to say anything except what I want you to say.\\xa0 One of my doctors is going to remove the gag from your mouth, I am going to ask you a question, and you will answer either yes or no.\\xa0 If you take too long, I\\u2019ll consider it the same as you giving me the answer I don\\u2019t want to hear.\\xa0 You do not want to say anything but that yes or no.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t lie to me,\\u201d he said, as he signaled one doctor, \\u201cI don\\u2019t believe in torture.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t like it, even as I recognize just how common it is.\\xa0 Our own bodies torture us with hunger and pain if we put ourselves in the wrong circumstances.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re smart about this, you won\\u2019t experience either.\\xa0 You can say you won\\u2019t give me an answer, and nothing will be done to you, but don\\u2019t lie, and don\\u2019t say anything but \\u2018yes\\u2019 or \\u2018no\\u2019.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>One of the doctors stepped forward.\\xa0 Two keys were inserted into either side of the gag, latches clicked, locks came undone, and the entire thing jumped in the man\\u2019s hands.\\xa0 He withdrew it, and with it came a two-foot long cord of interconnected metal and tubes, with what looked like a lamprey worked out into the center of it all, thin streams of blood trailing from tiny teeth at the one end.</p>\\n<p>Avis coughed and sputtered, gagging as the end of the tube came out.\\xa0 Her head bowed as she dry-heaved, coughing.</p>\\n<p>The Duke spoke, very clearly, \\u201cWill you tell me where I can find the other cells of Percy\\u2019s enhanced clones?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She looked at the Duke, then at each of us.\\xa0 I could imagine the cogs in her brain turning, over and over, trying to figure out the trick, the catch.\\xa0 She coughed, trying to clear her throat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, I assume?\\u201d the Duke asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she said, voice hoarse and gravelly to the point she sounded like an old man.</p>\\n<p>The Duke nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cDoctor, I don\\u2019t believe there\\u2019s a need for the gag.\\xa0 You can leave it out.\\xa0 Avis, I\\u2019ll be back soon.\\xa0 Take some time to consider your next response.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She opened her mouth as though she was about to speak, then closed it.\\xa0 She looked between us, wary, before fighting her bonds anew.</p>\\n<p>The Duke gestured to the door.\\xa0 I hopped down from my seat.\\xa0 The way things went, I wound up right beside Jamie as we passed through the door together, the doctors behind us.</p>\\n<p>Not that \\u2018together\\u2019 was the right word.</p>\\n<p>The Duke let the door shut.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMay I ask?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAsk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLord, time is kind of of the essence, isn\\u2019t it?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is.\\xa0 Time is the operative word, as it happens, Sylvester,\\u201d the Duke told me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou know, I\\u2019m very interested in the brain.\\xa0 You raised the topic with Avis Pardoe, and the timing felt serendipitous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTime and brains, my lord?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 I felt as if he was getting at something.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhile you were looking after your fellow Lambs at the Hedge, seeing that they got the care they needed, I was busy looking after Mrs. Pardoe.\\xa0 All four of my doctors worked on her.\\xa0 One worked on her <em>brain</em>.\\xa0 She\\u2019ll experience time in a very different way from now on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It dawned on me.\\xa0 \\u201cWith utmost respect, my lord, I\\u2019m assuming she won\\u2019t think you were gone for a few minutes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe won\\u2019t <em>feel</em> as if I was gone for a few minutes, no.\\xa0 In terms of raw thinking ability, I\\u2019m sure she\\u2019ll be able to rationalize it and logically work out that time is passing normally.\\xa0 But she\\u2019ll think faster in some ways and slower in others.\\xa0 Perhaps she\\u2019ll feel as if it has been days.\\xa0 Weeks, more likely?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He made it a question\\xa0 One of his doctors gave him a nod, and a murmured, \\u201cM\\u2019lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMonths aren\\u2019t out of the question?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, my lord.\\xa0 Not out of the question,\\u201d the Doctor said, quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cWithout patience or pacing, years or decades aren\\u2019t out of the question either.\\xa0 It depends on her coping mechanisms.\\xa0 If she tries to keep count of passing seconds and minutes, it will seem more pronounced.\\xa0 The watched pot, in this case, never boils.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo torture, no pain, no mutilation,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 He looked pleased.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m doing nothing more than giving her the time she needs to reconsider her stance.\\xa0 After that, I will let her consider whether to turn in people she worked with, and whether to join the Academy in earnest, working to put herself back in our good graces.\\xa0 I suppose we might have her report the whereabouts of her family and acquaintances, for future leverage.\\xa0 I imagine it will be a productive night.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian, was it?\\xa0 You\\u2019re the student.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpeak your mind, child.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t- I think what you\\u2019re doing <em>is</em> torture.\\xa0 Worse than anything you could do to her body, my lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d think a student was more on top of what the Academy is capable of doing, Lillian,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cIs it truly so bad?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t wait too long, my lord.\\xa0 You may be underestimating how frail the average person is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood advice,\\u201d he said, nodding.\\xa0 He touched her hair.\\xa0 \\u201cGood child.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll see to her after we\\u2019re done talking, then, rather than waiting the full thirty minutes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian ventured a smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hadn\\u2019t considered.\\xa0 My doctors said it would be effective, and I almost didn\\u2019t believe them, but the principle wasn\\u2019t unsound, giving her more time to think, so to speak, or giving that time a different sort of meaning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was a weird thought, one that I couldn\\u2019t quite frame, in the context of who the Duke was.\\xa0 He hadn\\u2019t considered, which meant he couldn\\u2019t empathize, which meant\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord,\\u201d I said, \\u201cWas something similar done to you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Duke smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cIt was.\\xa0 I do suppose I\\u2019ve had the advantage of it being the case from birth, something I\\u2019ve learned to harness, while our guest is experiencing it new, not a shift from a walk to a canter, or vice versa, but to a different vehicle altogether.\\xa0 Even I wouldn\\u2019t enjoy the deprivation of sensation she\\u2019s experiencing now.\\xa0 Doing nothing with my time is an alien idea to me, and wouldn\\u2019t have been permitted regardless.\\xa0 I wouldn\\u2019t say I think faster, but I can devote exactly the right amount of time to a problem as is needed.\\xa0 Brains are so fascinating, aren\\u2019t they?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d I said, my voice falling in with the others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen my brothers, sister and I were asked who was willing to come to Radham, the research being on brains here was one reason I volunteered,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cAs clever as this small alteration to my own brain is, it\\u2019s crude.\\xa0 I often find myself wondering if my own heirs will have better brains.\\xa0 If it\\u2019s possible that one of <em>you</em> will be the model for the next generation of nobles.\\xa0 Or perhaps one of you will, when given permission, explore other options and open the doors to a new age.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d we said.\\xa0 I was very cognizant of Jamie, who hadn\\u2019t had that permission to explore the options he\\u2019d dipped his toe into, and of Lillian, who knew about Jamie, but was a far worse liar than Jamie was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me, Lillian, what\\u2019s your end goal?\\u201d the Duke asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy goal, my lord?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you want to become a noble\\u2019s doctor?\\u201d\\xa0 The Duke indicated the doctors standing at attention just behind him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord, I\\u2019d-\\u201d Lillian started.\\xa0 She stopped abruptly as the Duke\\u2019s hand went up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, my lord.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t mean any offense, I-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Again the hand went up.\\xa0 I was annoyed on Lillian\\u2019s behalf.\\xa0 Me, I could deal.\\xa0 I\\u2019d earned the man\\u2019s ire earlier, and I had no idea if I\\u2019d patched it up by courting his favorite topic or if I had a sword looming over my head, ready to fall.\\xa0 But he\\u2019d asked a question and he wasn\\u2019t letting her answer.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t truly know her, and he was setting her up to fail.\\xa0 It was a blatant test.\\xa0 With three Lambs being patched up, I felt a little more protective of the ones who\\u2019d remained.\\xa0 Even if one was Jamie, who I had no idea how to deal with.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, my lord,\\u201d she said, again.\\xa0 She stopped there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWere I to start talking about the Lambs and how things work, my hopes for the project and the possibility for the Crown, heads would turn.\\xa0 I know how I was when I was young, my brain working the way it does, and I have many family members who are roughly your age,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 He arched one eyebrow and looked at Lillian.\\xa0 \\u201cMy younger relatives might well want to be Lambs, as a lark, or to have a way of stretching their legs as I did earlier today, I would imagine you\\u2019re the easiest one to replace, should we need to make room on this team.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian was so bad at hiding her tells.\\xa0 I could see the horror on her face.</p>\\n<p>I felt it, myself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr to move to a new team formed of nobles and higher quality work, now that I think about it,\\u201d the Duke mused.\\xa0 \\u201cCounsel, an unbiased perspective able to inform the new group about how things are done.\\xa0 You and three or four young nobles?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord, I wouldn\\u2019t be worthy,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She was trying to keep her expression straight.\\xa0 She tried a smile and failed.\\xa0 She cleared her throat, though it wasn\\u2019t her voice that had gone funny, but her face, as if she could make the sound and distract from what her face was doing.</p>\\n<p>The Duke took it in stride as if it was something that happened daily.</p>\\n<p>I felt a weird kind of jealousy and irritation at that.\\xa0 If he was doing that unintentionally to Lillian, then it wasn\\u2019t right or fair of him.\\xa0 If he was doing it <em>intentionally</em>, then he was bothering her in a way that was usually for <em>me</em> to do.\\xa0 Not to mention that I was a lot more careful about how I did it, while the Duke didn\\u2019t seem to understand any of the nuances here.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHmm,\\u201d the Duke made a noise, considering.\\xa0 \\u201cThe reason I ask, dear Lillian, is that you\\u2019ve earned my attention and my respect.\\xa0 If you know where you\\u2019re going, it could inform my choices, so I leave you as happy and close to your end goal as possible.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA-a black coat, my lord,\\u201d Lillian stuttered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA political appointment as much as it has anything to do with status.\\xa0 You could learn to navigate the playing field by studying certain Lambs,\\u201d the Duke said, indicating me.</p>\\n<p>Had she given the right answer?\\xa0 Did this lead the Duke to think she belonged with the Lambs?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut,\\u201d he said, \\u201cYou could well earn your professorship in record time, no matter where you are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Nope.\\xa0 That\\u2019s the kind of conclusion that leads the man to think she could be put anywhere.</em></p>\\n<p>Lillian managed the most insincere smile I\\u2019d ever seen, and she was trying.</p>\\n<p>Was this man going to <em>casually</em> tear the team asunder, just like that?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord,\\u201d Jamie said, pulling attention off Lillian. \\u201cIs there a particular reason you\\u2019re thinking about restructuring the team?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been reading your files, as well as the latest updates.\\xa0 It may be time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was approaching the limit of my patience.</p>\\n<p>No, wait, scratch that.\\xa0 I\\u2019d reached it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLord Duke,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I took a half-step to position myself forward and to one side, putting myself more in front of Jamie and Lillian, between them and the Duke.\\xa0 Jamie touched my arm, an instinctive movement, before he pulled away.\\xa0 I spoke, \\u201cYou\\u2019re wrong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Behind the Duke\\u2019s back, the noble\\u2019s doctors broke their stoic composure to give me looks as if I were insane.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou disagree,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 Voice cold and dangerous.\\xa0 \\u201cI haven\\u2019t forgotten the insolence earlier.\\xa0 You test me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith all due respect, my lord, you were testing <em>her</em>.\\xa0 We all have default behaviors we go back to when we\\u2019re on unstable footing.\\xa0 Lillian\\u2019s a good soldier, she defaults to shutting up and following orders, to insecurity and not speaking up when she needs to.\\xa0 If you move forward with either of the options you\\u2019re thinking about, you will utterly destroy her.\\xa0 You will hurt the Lambs, lord Duke.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA strategic break, nothing more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re <em>growing</em>, my lord, we\\u2019re still young, we\\u2019re not fully developed.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s improving by leaps and bounds, Lillian\\u2019s getting better.\\xa0 We\\u2019re evolving the team dynamic.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2018Evolving\\u2019 may be the wrong word,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cGoing by reports and what I\\u2019ve seen, things might be trending in the opposite direction.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d <em>noticed</em>.\\xa0 The realization almost took my breath away, stealing my ability to argue.</p>\\n<p>I did what I could to hide my tells.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re effective as a group, my lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I felt a hand touch the small of my back, insistent.</p>\\n<p><em>Too far.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs an <em>experiment</em>, you\\u2019re too muddled with one another to assess independently,\\u201d the Duke spoke.\\xa0 \\u201cI have the distinct impression you\\u2019re <em>arguing</em> with me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord, I would say I\\u2019m arguing <em>for</em> the Lambs, not arguing <em>against</em> you.\\xa0 Forgive me, but when I talked about my views in front of Avis, I couldn\\u2019t help but feel you and I are on the same page, of similar views on where we should be collectively headed.\\xa0 Let me add my views to yours, and yours to mine, my lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPresumptuous, too,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>Oh.\\xa0 Well.\\xa0 That was that.\\xa0 I\\u2019d gone and offended him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve had others challenge me like this,\\u201d the Duke observed.\\xa0 \\u201cTrying to appeal to my desire for excitement and challenge by arguing points, being reckless in conversation with me, foregoing custom and formality.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t dare speak at this point.\\xa0 I\\u2019d let my mouth run off with me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m trying to decide if you\\u2019ve crossed the line that the rest did in trying to challenge me,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I waited for an indication I had permission to continue.\\xa0 He gave it, raising his chin a fraction.\\xa0 \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t actively trying to challenge you.\\xa0 I swear this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve read your file, Sylvester,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He touched the side of my face.\\xa0 \\u201cYou talked about the behavior we all return to when we\\u2019re on shaky footing.\\xa0 I know this is where you go when you\\u2019re insecure, how you function as a living being.\\xa0 I do believe you when you say that, and it does inform my answer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>As much as you know and believe that that, I know that you default to playing with the lives of those around you.\\xa0\\xa0</em><em>When the world doesn\\u2019t suit you or make sense, you reorder it.\\xa0 You\\u2019re good at reordering it.\\xa0 A builder more than a destroyer.\\xa0 But you\\u2019re too big of a man, Lord Duke.\\xa0 You\\u2019re a giant among mere mortals, and the most trivial actions you undertake are ones with massive ramifications for the rest of us.\\xa0 That\\u2019s how you function.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Except you\\u2019re not a dumb giant, trampling over everything in your path.\\xa0 You know just how small we are</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re seeing me as a threat, you\\u2019re studying me, and you\\u2019re working out a plan of attack,\\u201d he observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Jamie said, just behind me.</p>\\n<p>No, couldn\\u2019t dwell on Jamie, had to focus.\\xa0 As if mirroring the thought, the Duke raised a hand, indicating with a raised finger that Jamie should stay silent and stay out of this.</p>\\n<p>In this, too, the Duke and I were on the same page.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you thinking, \\u2018Sy\\u2019?\\u201d the Duke asked me, staring down at me with eyes that showed too much white.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord.\\xa0 I\\u2019m thinking that you\\u2019re smarter than you\\u2019re acting right now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>If Gordon had been present, I was pretty sure he would have socked me one right there, to shut me up, then worked to beg for mercy.\\xa0 He was being looked after for his heart.\\xa0 Mary might have stabbed my butt like she had Helen\\u2019s, just to make it clear I was being stupid.</p>\\n<p>But this wasn\\u2019t a man who accepted half-measures.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPrecious Sylvester,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 His body language and voice softened.\\xa0 He smiled, and his tone became something very dangerous, alongside the gentle phrasing and volume.\\xa0 \\u201cI think you should explain yourself very carefully.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lambs are a unit, my lord.\\xa0 We developed to cover each others\\u2019 weaknesses.\\xa0 I, myself, was pushed forward to patch a gaping hole in the group.\\xa0 But splitting us up now is like clipping a rose branch when it hasn\\u2019t budded yet.\\xa0 You know you can let us reach a more complete state before evaluating us.\\xa0 You have people come to you wanting to challenge you because you <em>want</em> to be challenged, you signal it, you outright <em>asked</em> for it with Avis.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI signal this?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 Not a question so much as a challenge.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve talked about home.\\xa0 You want what you had there, on a deeper level.\\xa0 Back home, I have to assume, if you bared your throat like you\\u2019re doing here, someone would seize the opportunity.\\xa0 You\\u2019re doing it here, I\\u2019m seizing, and I\\u2019m hoping I\\u2019m doing it well enough you\\u2019re going to accept it where you\\u2019ve rejected others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He stared down at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFirst of all,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou forgot to call me \\u2018lord\\u2019.\\xa0 I have a grave appreciation of formality, Sylvester.\\xa0 It signals respect.\\xa0 Forgetting something so simple is a telling blow to your attempt to earn my respect by challenging me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t budge an inch or give any outward sign or change of expression, but interally I was screaming and running around in circles.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSecond, your argument hinges on the notion that you\\u2019re not yet done developing to your full strength.\\xa0 Yet your Gordon is near the end.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve had more injuries.\\xa0 Your group dynamic is reportedly and observably breaking down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He let that point hang in the air.</p>\\n<p>I ventured a response.\\xa0 \\u201cMy lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gave me consent to continue, a dismissive backhand swipe with the fingers of one hand.\\xa0 His eyes and body remained stone still, not budging.</p>\\n<p>I lowered my eyes.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had more injuries because we\\u2019ve been taking on more challenging missions.\\xa0 If the Lambs are breaking down, if we\\u2019re dying or nearly done, let the first Lamb die or break away before you take any action.\\xa0 You only lose the opportunity to work on the most perishable of us, and you stand to gain our loyal service in the meantime.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes still lowered, my heart pounding, I couldn\\u2019t see his expression, nor how much I\\u2019d succeeded or failed in swaying him.</p>\\n<p>It was a massive weight on my shoulders, wondering if I\\u2019d doomed myself or doomed the group.\\xa0 I let that weight be something real, driving me to the ground.\\xa0 Eyes fixed on the floor of the hallway in the Bowels, I dropped to my knee.\\xa0 I heard and felt the movement of Jamie and Lillian behind me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was my plan already, Sylvester,\\u201d the Duke said, above me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re not entirely wrong in your judgment of what I was doing.\\xa0 The Lambs are not ready to be broken up.\\xa0 We already have enough experiments capable of acting independently, too few who work as a collective.\\xa0 I was thinking aloud, wanting to see your response.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re forgiven for this.\\xa0 Stand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stood.\\xa0 My hands shook a bit as I did.\\xa0 I hooked my thumbs into the pockets of my shorts.\\xa0 The fact that my shirt stuck to my back had nothing to do with the summer heat \\u2013 we\\u2019d spent the last while in the Bowels, and it was cool this deep underground, if not quite refreshing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou are not, however, forgiven the transgression earlier.\\xa0 I know it is your nature, but I did say I would punish you, and I do what I say.\\xa0 I will decide on something fitting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour fellow Lambs should be going straight from getting care to having their appointments.\\xa0 Have yours as your doctors are able.\\xa0 I expect you to be ready for another task before the week is over.\\xa0 The war wages on, and our enemy is catching up to us in fits and starts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 My voice was joined by Jamie and Lillian\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI give you leave to go,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cForgive me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie\\u2019s eyes remained fixed on the ground.\\xa0 With just a bit of sweat on his nose, his glasses slid down the bridge of the nose.\\xa0 He pushed them back up into place.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s customary for the Lambs to fill each other in, so none of us are in the dark or lagging behind the others.\\xa0 Most often that\\u2019s me.\\xa0 But we\\u2019re going to talk to the others, and we\\u2019re going to talk about this conversation.\\xa0 May I ask, if Sy hadn\\u2019t spoken up, would this have ended differently?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would have given it thought first, much as Avis is giving her matter some consideration right now.\\xa0 My instinct is that you would have been disbanded,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cDear Lillian thrown to the nobles, perhaps, Helen ordered to my apartments, the rest of you left to fend for yourselves, with every expectation you wouldn\\u2019t fend for particularly long, but you\\u2019d see to the most essential tasks in the meantime.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you, my lord.\\xa0 Knowing that will make this easier to convey to Mary and Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Duke declined his head in acknowledgement.\\xa0 He swept his fingers to one side to dismiss us, and we were gone.</p>\\n<p>We fled, leaving the Bowels and heading off to our individual, long-postponed appointments.\\xa0 Lambs to the Tower.</p>\\n<p>The exit from the Bowels and the first half of the walk was painfully quiet.\\xa0 We walked among soldiers and warbeasts, students and stitched.</p>\\n<p>Halfway there, Lillian started crying.\\xa0 Heads turned, curious, but nobody stopped for us.</p>\\n<p>I reached out for her hand, and she squeezed mine so hard it hurt.\\xa0 She kept wiping at tears, only for new ones to show up.\\xa0 Had she simply let them fall, they might have been blamed on the light drizzle.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCrybaby,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She kicked me far harder than was necessary.\\xa0 Doing it while walking meant having to take a quick half-step forward and a twist to one side.\\xa0 She pulled her hand away from mine as she did it, but I held it firmly.\\xa0 I tugged her closer to me, and put my other hand around hers, until I held one of her hands firmly in both my own.\\xa0 I squeezed hard.</p>\\n<p>I was aware of Jamie, so much quieter than usual, a little to my right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou stood up for me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a Lamb,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t going to let him throw you to some group of golden-haired sociopaths so they can torment you to death.\\xa0 Tormenting you is my job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can do without that part,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou sure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPretty sure,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI like you more when you\\u2019re nice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was very possibly the worst thing she could have said or brought up with Jamie there, overhearing.</p>\\n<p>She sniffed again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHere,\\u201d I said, letting go of her hand with one of mine and extending a sleeve, my hand pulled inside.\\xa0 \\u201cBlow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn your shirt?\\xa0 Eww, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m changing first chance I get anyway, and I don\\u2019t have any handkerchiefs to offer.\\xa0 You want me to try being nice, take what you can get.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She sniffed, gave me a wary look, then took the cuff of my shirt and blew her nose into it.</p>\\n<p>The moment she released my hand, I wiped the snot on the fabric at her shoulder.</p>\\n<p>She shrieked and came after me, kicking and pummeling me with fists.\\xa0 I dodged as best as I could, up until she pushed me into a puddle.\\xa0 She kicked me when I was down, as much to splash me with muddy water as to drive the toe of her too-hard shoe into my thigh.\\xa0 Proof as much as anything that she <em>was</em> learning stuff from being with the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>But she was smiling, and Jamie was smiling too.\\xa0 I raised my arms in surrender, and the two of them approached me, offering their hands.</p>\\n<p>Jamie hadn\\u2019t said a word since we\\u2019d left the Duke\\u2019s company.</p>\\n<p>We passed the checkpoint at the tower, the guards giving me suspicious look as I dripped liberally with mud.\\xa0 I kept an eye out for the proboscis as it searched Lillian, and saw it pause at the mucus on her shoulder.\\xa0 She gave me a look.</p>\\n<p>But we were cleared to pass inside.\\xa0 Here, at least, we were regular enough to be known to the guards.</p>\\n<p>Checking on the other Lambs was priority number one.\\xa0 The door to Mary\\u2019s lab was closed, the doctors absent.\\xa0 Ibott and Helen weren\\u2019t present either, but I fully expected her to still be at the Hedge or deep in the Bowels, getting replacement skin after the burns.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was awake.</p>\\n<p>He lay on a table, his chest open.\\xa0 Tubes fed into it, crimson fluid churning and bubbling within.\\xa0 Doctors milled around him, chattering.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy had a long conversation with the Duke,\\u201d Jamie reported, as we drew next to the bedside.</p>\\n<p>Gordon blinked.\\xa0 He lay his head down on the table, staring at the ceiling.\\xa0 \\u201cGood thing my heart\\u2019s not in my chest.\\xa0 I might have had a heart attack at the idea.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReally?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIs it?\\xa0 Can I see?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He grunted, then eased himself up, until his arms propped his upper body up.\\xa0 The tubes fed into his chest, showing some metal clips and bits here and there, the blood-pumping tubes were connected to the major ins and outs around where the heart should be.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re dirty,\\u201d Gordon remarked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a heartless bastard,\\u201d I said, pointing at this hole.\\xa0 \\u201cIs that permanent?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said, lying back down, staring up at the ceiling.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m getting the same heart back.\\xa0 They\\u2019re changing some things, but the problem might recur.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, but I didn\\u2019t feel happy about the news.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI might be getting a dog,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Dog-</em>dog or dog-dog?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat makes no sense, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know what I mean.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA dog.\\xa0 A Gordon dog, for me.\\xa0 I told them that Dog could hear the heart going before I was even fully aware of it.\\xa0 They\\u2019re going to put something together for me.\\xa0 Inconspicuous, but built like I am, and a dog.\\xa0 If I know about the problems, I won\\u2019t jump into the fray and only realize I\\u2019m having problems when I can\\u2019t get out of it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot guaranteed to be a dog,\\u201d one Doctor said, passing by with clipboard in hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt better not be a cat!\\u201d Gordon called out to the man\\u2019s back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong with cats?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t <em>do</em> anything with cats,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSounds like a good stopgap,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe good enough for them to find another good heart, or a way to keep my body from hurting too much as it rides out the rejection.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon held up a hand, fingers crossed.</p>\\n<p>I did the same.\\xa0 Jamie and Lillian did too.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow\\u2019s Mary?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGrumpy.\\xa0 She stopped in.\\xa0 She\\u2019s getting surgery.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd Helen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHaven\\u2019t heard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright.\\xa0 Look, I\\u2019ve got an appointment I\\u2019m itching to get done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd a shower, apparently.\\xa0 Did you <em>roll</em> in mud?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd Lillian\\u2019s been gross and got snot all over her uniform.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian kicked at me.\\xa0 I jumped out of the way, bumping into a doctor.</p>\\n<p>The man physically picked me up, carried me two steps, and planted me firmly down with the others, pressing down as if it would keep me in place, before carrying on with his business.</p>\\n<p>By the time I\\u2019d figured out what was going on and turned around, he\\u2019d disappeared into the mill of Gordon\\u2019s doctors.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d wanted to get revenge on one person.\\xa0 Maybe I\\u2019d have to get revenge on the whole bunch of them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll stop in when you\\u2019re through the worst part,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHopefully.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want to be here too long.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said, \\u201cThanks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll fill the rest of you in on the conversation with the Duke,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cFelt important.\\xa0 A sense of where we\\u2019re going.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood going or no?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot as bad as it could have been,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut elaborating on that would require sharing the whole conversation.\\xa0 After.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you\\u2019re okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBad day, but I\\u2019m okay,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhichever one of us finishes first, we meet the other?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe grab Mary when she\\u2019s done.\\xa0 With Percy coming up today, she might need to talk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>Lillian, Jamie and I headed over to Jamie\\u2019s lab next.\\xa0 The silence was oppressive, and even my attempt to shake like a dog and get the worst of the mud-brown water off only provoked smiles, not joking conversation.</p>\\n<p>As we reached the lab, Jamie grabbed his bag with the book.\\xa0 He waved at his team of doctors, then pulled the book out, and then bent down, to put it down, so it would lean against the doorframe.</p>\\n<p>I was there before he did.\\xa0 I put a hand between book and frame, grabbing the book.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to, Sy,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI promised,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>I watch you as you go to sleep.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know you want your appointment right now more than anything, and with the Duke and everything else, it might be a question of our group\\u2019s survival.\\xa0 That whole thing was too close for comfort.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI promised.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe promise was that you\\u2019d\\u2026\\u201d he glanced at Lillian, then his doctors, obviously uncomfortable.\\xa0 \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t matter if I\\u2019m here.\\xa0 It\\u2019s different.\\xa0 You shouldn\\u2019t put your appointment off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBullshit.\\xa0 I shouldn\\u2019t break my promise,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I tugged the book from his hands.\\xa0 \\u201cI promised.\\xa0 Now I\\u2019m going to take the book and I\\u2019m going to look after it, and I\\u2019m going to sit here and if you try to convince me to do anything different, I\\u2019m going to rub snot on <em>you</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He met my eyes, a searching stare.</p>\\n<p>I only withstood the discomfort for a short while.\\xa0 I broke eye contact, looking at Lillian.\\xa0 \\u201cNot that it matters, you strip down anyway and they launder your clothes for you in the meantime.\\xa0 Lillian should move over.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned my focus to Lillian, repositioning her much as the doctor had me, moving her to one side of the doorframe.</p>\\n<p>When I turned around, Jamie was heading to his chair, a throne with tubes and connections running into and through it.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t open his mouth as one of his doctors led him up to the seat.</p>\\n<p>He pulled off his shirt, then pulled off his pants.\\xa0 A doctor draped a cloth over his lap in time to protect his modesty.\\xa0 Lillian wouldn\\u2019t have even blushed.</p>\\n<p>I took a seat in the doorway, back to one side, feet propped up against the other, book in my lap.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d Lillian whispered.\\xa0 She hadn\\u2019t budged from where I\\u2019d moved her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFeels like something happened between you two.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>It was your fault</em>, I thought, but the thought had no meat or merit to it, I knew.\\xa0 She\\u2019d just been the unwitting catalyst to this whole mess.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s nothing,\\u201d was all I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, Sy,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThanks for holding my hand and making me laugh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat about the other stuff?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think I got you back.\\xa0 It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Then she was gone.\\xa0 Back to her dorm to wash up and let reality sink in.\\xa0 I imagined it was really lonely, and I was surprised at the level of empathy I felt in that regard.</p>\\n<p>No, it shouldn\\u2019t have been surprising.\\xa0 I turned my attention to Jamie, who waved.</p>\\n<p>I gave him a small wave back.</p>\\n<p>Then my eyes dropped to the book.\\xa0 I avoided looking at Jamie as the Doctors set everything up, pulling cloths off of the vats.\\xa0 A faint bioluminescent glow filled the room.</p>\\n<p>I <em>knew</em> that if I looked at him, he\\u2019d gesture my way, and I\\u2019d have to respond.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t know how to respond.</p>\\n<p>Instead, I looked down at his notebook.\\xa0 Annals of past events, from someone with a perfect memory.\\xa0 I looked across the room at the bookshelves that ringed it, still avoiding looking directly at Jamie, and thought about the way things had been.\\xa0 All of the memories in there.</p>\\n<p>I saw the men walk up the steps.\\xa0 In keeping with the promise, I watched carefully as they put the mask on, and put Jamie to sleep.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure Jamie saw me looking.</p>\\n<p>All the same, when they threw the switch, it made me jump.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was under.\\xa0 He sagged slightly, the cords and connections running into his back and all down his spine, tension tight, holding him mostly upright.\\xa0 I could hear the humming, see the overlarge brains in tanks move slightly, reacting to altered blood flow and temperature.</p>\\n<p>I nodded, then opened the book, paging through it.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to find an answer, and I didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 There was an insight into Jamie\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 A drawing of the rat with grass and flowers growing out of it, other things he\\u2019d seen \\u2013 creatures I\\u2019d missed, people in the street.\\xa0 The Lambs recurred, over and over again.\\xa0 The strokes were bold and harsh, sketchy more than anything.</p>\\n<p>A perfect memory made for that kind of harsh view of things, maybe.\\xa0 You couldn\\u2019t forget the ugly little details.</p>\\n<p>I closed the book.\\xa0 The answers I needed weren\\u2019t in there.</p>\\n<p>I spent a while looking at Jamie, then a while looking across the hall and out the window.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey,\\u201d a man\\u2019s voice said.</p>\\n<p>I raised my head.\\xa0 I saw a bruiser of a man in a lab coat that didn\\u2019t fit him.\\xa0 \\u201cOh.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I was supposed to stop in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t fucking waste our time, Sylvester,\\u201d Huey said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t mean to.\\xa0 I was thinking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll think better after your appointment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I nodded to myself.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\xa0 That\\u2019s true.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s get it done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow?\\xa0 Huey, look, if we can\\u2019t-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not my name.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I blinked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDewey,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cClose enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt hasn\\u2019t been <em>that</em> long, Sylvester,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, probably not,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cCan you do me a favor?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI seem to recall the last two favors ending up-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot like that,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 I just\\u2026 I need to think, without Wyvern.\\xa0 To see if I even can figure out this problem in my head, when I\\u2019m like this?\\xa0 Do you get what I mean?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah, look, can I stay?\\xa0 You can dick off and do whatever, or get caught up on whatever.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gave me a level stare.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease, Dewey.\\xa0 I need to be here, I think.\\xa0 Or I won\\u2019t be focused on the problem.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe use the restraints this time.\\xa0 You stay put, after getting dosed, you stay quiet, you don\\u2019t bitch, you don\\u2019t get clever and try to run off while you\\u2019re working through the worst of the pain.\\xa0 Think you can manage that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI fucking hope so,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cFuck with us on this and you don\\u2019t get any favors again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>He tromped off, heavy feet clumping down the hall.</p>\\n<p>Avis was enduring her own mental gauntlet, caught with nothing else to do but try to endure, to figure out what her answer to the Duke would be.\\xa0 Mine touched on unfamiliar territory.\\xa0 On Jamie, and a divide between us that I couldn\\u2019t ignore.</p>\\n<p>It <em>hurt</em>, that things couldn\\u2019t be what they were.\\xa0 I was angry, I was confused.\\xa0 There was no right answer to give, yet if I couldn\\u2019t one, then things would be broken like this forever.</p>\\n<p>That he\\u2019d think I wouldn\\u2019t look after his book or keep the promise after everything we\\u2019d been through, it scared me.\\xa0 Some things were inviolable.\\xa0 It made me feel uneasy.</p>\\n<p>Hours passed.\\xa0 It was dark, but for flickering lights and the glow from the room, the doctors rotating so that one was observing at all times.</p>\\n<p>The entire time, I was trying to unravel the problem, though the edges of my brain had dulled.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure why I was so stubborn about wanting to do it without a full dose of Wyvern, but I\\u2019d started the journey and wasn\\u2019t about to abandon it.</p>\\n<p>I looked deep within, trying to find a glimmer of something, as if I could pry out some part of myself that could see Jamie in the way he seemed to see me.\\xa0 I thought back, memory by memory, trying to figure out when things had changed, knowing my memory was weak at the best of times.\\xa0 I thought about looking in the books, but somehow I knew I needed to find the answer <em>here,</em> not <em>there</em>.</p>\\n<p>As the third doctor came in for their night-shift, stepping over me in the doorway, I asked the time, and was informed it was four in the morning.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps an hour after that, I realized what it was I was trying to do.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t have one more minute like the past afternoon and evening had been.\\xa0 Not another second of that painful awkwardness.\\xa0 I wouldn\\u2019t be able to endure it.</p>\\n<p>I had to greet him with a genuine smile as he woke.\\xa0 Nothing more.\\xa0 I could do that much.\\xa0 I was sure that it would at least open the door for things to get better, and that was all we really needed.</p>\\n<p>Secure in that knowledge, I finally drifted off.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hands seized me and dragged me, pulling me out of the way.\\xa0 I stirred, annoyed, knowing I hadn\\u2019t gotten enough sleep, that it was far too early and I\\u2019d fallen asleep too late.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Then I realized where I was, my attention turned to where I was supposed to be \\u2013 sleeping while sitting astride the doorframe, and I connected the dots to what was going on.\\xa0 The Lambs were coming down the hall at a run \\u2013 Lillian, Gordon, Mary, a patchy Helen.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There were far too many doctors in the room.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The shock of being pulled from deep sleep didn\\u2019t seem to go away.\\xa0 I felt detached as I pulled myself to my feet.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gordon was shouting my name.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I ignored him, pushing my way through the doorway, into the room.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So many doctors here, talking, chatting.\\xa0 I\\u2019d seen all of them at one point or another.\\xa0 Hayle was just entering the room behind me.\\xa0 He gave me a passing glance, then headed over to talk to Jamie\\u2019s doctor.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I turned my attention to the throne.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie wasn\\u2019t there.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was a person, and that person looked down at me, but there was nothing there.\\xa0 No glimmer of recognition, no personality.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He moved his hand, and it was a movement that suggested he was figuring it out.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Empty.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I could hear the chatter as two dozen disparate voices, talking about the same sort of thing.\\xa0 What had been retained, what would be in the tanks, what to keep.\\xa0 Project caterpillar this, project caterpillar that.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Everyone on their best behavior, with the Duke leaning against the wall in the corner, arms folded, observing.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie\\u2019s name didn\\u2019t seem to come up once.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I spotted the doctors in charge of Jamie\\u2019s care.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">They were taking it in stride.\\xa0 Upset, as anyone would be when they had a bad day at work, but hardly upset enough.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I passed by one doctor, bumping into them, and my hand found their pocket.\\xa0 A scalpel was clipped to the inside.\\xa0 I grabbed it and popped off the tip.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A short distance later, I repeated the same process, finding another.\\xa0 I drew nearer to Hayle and the other doctors.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The closer I got, the more sure my steps were.\\xa0 I walked briskly, head down, scalpels hidden so they wouldn\\u2019t be too obvious.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I was tackled all the same, thrown to the ground, arms hugging my arms to my sides, scalpels gripped to either side of my waist.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I fought, squirming, elbowing, wrestling, mad and incoherent and not even sure what sounds were leaving my lips.\\xa0 Tears were streaming down my cheeks.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was <em>Jamie</em>, damn it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I managed to flip over, got my wrist free of the grip, and stabbed, only to get caught again, and swiftly disarmed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I stopped when I met Gordon\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 I saw the tears there.\\xa0 I saw the Lambs huddled behind him, the expressions in their faces.\\xa0 They were standing, and I was the one that was breaking.\\xa0 I stopped struggling and went limp.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe one fucking time you put up a half-decent fight, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said, soft words all too audible in the hush.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/13/lamb-to-the-slaughter-6-13/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The room had been built and grown in such a way that the furniture was an extension of the room, rather than an addition to it.\\xa0 The only walls that weren\\u2019t exterior walls were standalone, decorative more than anything, with benches built into them, facing tables.\\xa0 Nothing we could lift up to copy the Duke\\u2019s trick and form a bridge over fire.</p>\\n<p>Not that I necessarily felt confident, with the sparks flying around.</p>\\n<p>None of the walls were connected to any others.\\xa0 They might have been once, with walls removed as this part of the building was repurposed; an octagon with the diagonals removed.</p>\\n<p>Two of the walls separated the staircases on either side of the floor from the main area; I was looking past one to see the sea of fire in the center of the room.\\xa0 The other two walls did much the same thing for rooms on the north and south faces of the building, with balconies extending those rooms.\\xa0 The two rooms served for private conversation, and one of them was a hiding spot for our quarry.</p>\\n<p>All that said, <em>we</em> were the cornered ones.</p>\\n<p>I pulled off my shirt, backing away from the scene until my back was to a wall.\\xa0 I balled my shirt up in my hands, my eyes fixed on the Duke.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d I said, my voice only loud enough to be heard over crackling flames, \\u201cDo you have anything that will make me <em>not</em> flammable?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFocus!\\xa0 I\\u2019ve got stuff on me.\\xa0 Chemical, right?\\xa0 How do I make it so I don\\u2019t burst into flame the second a spark touches me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know!\\xa0 That\\u2019s not exactly part of what we study!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStitched overseer guys.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t have any junk you can pour on any of your soldiers that go up in flames?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt exists,\\u201d one of the men in charge of the stitched said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe don\\u2019t carry it all the time.\\xa0 Cans are heavy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I scowled, irritated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut if it\\u2019s chemical,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cWe can try a dry soap.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t promise, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo it!\\u201d I barked.\\xa0 \\u201cMe and Jamie.\\xa0 Before this gets worse.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThose floorboards,\\u201d Gordon commented.\\xa0 His face looked drawn, especially in the light of the fire.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re burning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes moved to the area he was looking at.\\xa0 Sure enough, the floorboards were catching fire.</p>\\n<p><em>Every second floorboard</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe modified the room,\\u201d I spoke the realization aloud.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe the building.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Duke turned his head, noting our presence, and I saw a smile on his face.\\xa0 He was cast in hues of orange and crimson, tall enough that the top of his head touched the smoke that was concentrating at the center of the ceiling and slowly creeping out toward the edges.</p>\\n<p>He leaped from a standing position, and the wall in front of us broke my line of sight.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d crossed the pool of fire.\\xa0 Approaching the other end of the building.</p>\\n<p>I saw figures in the shadows.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGhosts!\\u201d Jamie called out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 But he ignored them, approaching the northernmost wall.</p>\\n<p>Ghosts crept nearer.\\xa0 The room didn\\u2019t offer much cover, and they didn\\u2019t seem to know how to use the fire or smoke for cover.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t physical enough for their senses to process.</p>\\n<p>Still, there were five ghosts there, and possibly two more we couldn\\u2019t see, if I was keeping count right.\\xa0 I probably wasn\\u2019t keeping count right.</p>\\n<p>The Duke stepped around the wall, pistol going out, and fired four times.\\xa0 A large, dark shape darted out, passing around the far end of that wall, leaping well over the wall of flame that cut across her path.</p>\\n<p><em>Fast, agile</em>.\\xa0 That would be the combat drug.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She approached me, bottle in hand.\\xa0 She was shaking it.\\xa0 \\u201cWho\\u2019s first?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Jamie said, at the same time I said, \\u201cJamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gave me an annoyed look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe, then,\\u201d I said. \\xa0 Jamie was impossible to get through to when he got stubborn, and with him being in a strange way of thinking, I wasn\\u2019t sure if it wouldn\\u2019t be worse than usual.</p>\\n<p>With my shirt already off, Lillian was able to rub the \\u2018dry soap\\u2019 on me.\\xa0 It had a consistency like clay, it burned a little, and it had gritty bits that made it scratch as much as anything.</p>\\n<p>I clenched my teeth and endured, watching, trying to figure out what Avis was doing.</p>\\n<p>As she rounded the end of the wall that was furthest from us, I could get a better view of her.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d altered herself to the point that she looked more experiment than human.\\xa0 Four white-feathered wings framed her.</p>\\n<p>Her hair, skin and clothing were dusted white, too \\u2013 she\\u2019d covered herself in a powder, and much of it had been concentrated on her head.\\xa0 The effects of the combat drug were obvious.\\xa0 Her muscles were strained tight, and it included her face and neck.\\xa0 Her eyes were wide and unblinking, her lips parted to show teeth and gums that were too red.\\xa0 The bloodshot edges of her eyes and the crimson of her flushed lips were slices of red in an otherwise pale, powder-mottled complexion.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d taken off her lab coat, and wore a top that consisted only of a bit of cloth and straps to hold it in place.\\xa0 The same straps that held her harness on provided a little bit more security in binding the set of wings to her back.\\xa0 The feathers were slick with fresh blood, and that blood had been covered with more powder in turn.\\xa0 Bony, insectile limbs reached around her, hooking into flesh of rib and breast.\\xa0 At her shoulder, one had been shattered, a bullet grazing flesh, leaving the point of the limb embedded in flesh, the other end twitching.</p>\\n<p>Moving quickly, low to the ground, wings folded close to her back, she leaped through flame.\\xa0 The feathers didn\\u2019t ignite, and she didn\\u2019t react to any burn she might have sustained.</p>\\n<p>The Duke was a matter of steps behind her.\\xa0 She was faster, she was more agile, and she was apparently fireproof, or fire resistant.\\xa0 She could presumably fly, or she\\u2019d been able to, before the one hook had been damaged by a bullet.</p>\\n<p><em>She wants to run,</em> <em>to fly</em>, I thought.\\xa0 I tucked my shirt into the crook of my elbow, took some of the soap-sludge from Lillian, and rubbed it into my skin.\\xa0 I smeared a blob of it into the leg of my shorts, where some of the chemical had showered down on me.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t tell if I\\u2019d gotten all of it, so I merely took more soap and smeared it on over.\\xa0 I hoped it would be a layer of protection, and that I wouldn\\u2019t have to kick off my pants.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are we doing?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThinking,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThink <em>aloud</em>, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201c<em>Communicate.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not- I will as soon as I have something to say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Duke\\u2019s gun fired twice.\\xa0 He hurdled one six-foot wall of fire with seemingly no problem, landing on the bench by the western wall, opposite us.\\xa0 He called out as he picked his way across it, closing the distance, \\u201cYou gave yourself wings, Avis.\\xa0 Why don\\u2019t you fly?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know why,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>She was so close to us.\\xa0 Five or six paces.\\xa0 Three, and I could have possibly had an angle to throw a knife at her.</p>\\n<p>The ghosts crept closer to the duke, staying just out of arm\\u2019s reach.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t seem to pay much attention to them, except to hold one sword out in the direction of the nearest one, so the woman would run herself through if she lunged.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could promise to hold my fire,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m good for my word.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was no answer from Avis.</p>\\n<p>I followed the Duke\\u2019s line of thought to its natural conclusion.\\xa0 <em>She doesn\\u2019t want to fly because she\\u2019ll be a sitting duck in the air, without cover.\\xa0 She knows how good a shot the Duke is</em>.</p>\\n<p>Was she capable of diving for speed and to put more distance between her and any shooter, using the balcony itself for cover, or rounding the corner of the building?</p>\\n<p>Maybe she was, but the building was surrounded with soldiers.</p>\\n<p>How bad did things have to get here, before she was willing to risk death by bullet over a death by fire?</p>\\n<p>Gordon was saying something to one of the men in charge of the stitched.\\xa0 The men then turned, moved through the ranks of the stitched, communicating to a few at a time.\\xa0 Rifles were raised and pointed in Avis\\u2019 direction.</p>\\n<p>To stay out of the line of fire, I bent down.\\xa0 Lillian started rubbing the soap across my bare back, then along the belt-line of my shorts, where some of the chemical had no doubt trickled down and soaked in.</p>\\n<p>I gave serious consideration to going into this confrontation naked, just to be safe.\\xa0 The look I imagined on Lillian\\u2019s face was the first thing to bring me near a smile since the conversation with Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Mary cut into the thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to come.\\xa0 You\\u2019re going to say I can\\u2019t, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d Gordon jumped in.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you really think you can hurdle six feet of fire?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think they can, so that\\u2019s a moot point!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t.\\xa0 Not with that injury.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPainkiller,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No,</em>\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 Stay there, have knives ready.\\xa0 If ghosts come for us, aim for the ones who are busy dodging something else.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fire continued to spread along floorboards.\\xa0 A great \\u2018x\\u2019 had been cut into the room, and the space between the lines of that \\u2018x\\u2019 were filling in.\\xa0 The flames remained small, but they were gaining traction.</p>\\n<p><em>What did it take to change the flooring in the room?\\xa0 She controls all communication out of Claret Hall.\\xa0 Did she ask for a work order to be modified?\\xa0 Did a crew of stitched put in flammable floorboards under the noses of professors, doctors, and wealthy clients of the Academy?</em></p>\\n<p>How many small ways had she found to sabotage the lot of us?\\xa0 Was she the reason our enemies had been so well informed on the Lambs?\\xa0 The four humors had been pretty up to date.</p>\\n<p>The Duke had to pick his way across the room more carefully as the fire took over more of the area.\\xa0 He took a step to one side as flame touched one of the cushions a matter of feet from the Duke, only for the cushion to explode in a violent roll of fire.</p>\\n<p>A ghost appeared, airborne, taking advantage of the Duke\\u2019s turned back.\\xa0 She landed astride his shoulders, and, so quickly it looked like I\\u2019d missed something, she began slamming a knife into the side of his neck, once, twice, three times.</p>\\n<p>He tossed his sword down, reached back, and grabbed her.</p>\\n<p>She slammed the knife deep into his face once, as he hauled her around in front of him.</p>\\n<p>One-handed, he tossed her into the pool of fire at the center of the room.</p>\\n<p>The Duke made that amused sound.\\xa0 He turned, a little overdramatically, his coat sweeping out around behind him.\\xa0 His eyes were wide, the heavy lines in his face catching the light and shadow of the fire and smoke, the veneer of humanity no longer visible.\\xa0 The gaping wound in his cheek wasn\\u2019t helping matters.</p>\\n<p>He spat out what looked like a full mouthful of blood, directly at the flame.\\xa0 It hissed in response.</p>\\n<p>That much blood, the knife had to have gouged the roof of his mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReminds me of home,\\u201d he called out, to Avis.\\xa0 His voice was different, with the wound.\\xa0 He spat again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re done,\\u201d Lillian told me, slapping my back.\\xa0 \\u201cI can\\u2019t promise-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t waste a second.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen and I left Jamie behind.</p>\\n<p>Walls with heavy decoration carved into them meant handholds and footholds.\\xa0 I signaled Helen, then interlaced my fingers.</p>\\n<p>With a running start, she stepped into my hand.\\xa0 I hauled her up as best as I could.</p>\\n<p>Virtually any combination of us would have been better than Helen and I, for this particular trick.\\xa0 Gordon in particular could have gotten Helen up as high as she needed.\\xa0 Mary was more adroit.\\xa0 I would have had Helen boost me up, but her strength worked differently, it didn\\u2019t add up to me being able to add her lifting strength to my leaping strength.</p>\\n<p>I got her up to the point that only her foot and ankle were touched by flame before she managed to climb up another step.\\xa0 I double checked she wasn\\u2019t slipping before stepping away.</p>\\n<p>What served as a running start for me were moments where Helen was closer to the ceiling, where smoke was thicker, perched on the wall directly above the open fire.\\xa0 Seared by heat, she nonetheless found footholds, one handhold, and extended a hand my way.</p>\\n<p><em>Time to see if the soap worked</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>I adjusted my grip on the bundle of chemical-soaked cloth, then ran.</p>\\n<p>I was quick, I was lightweight, and I was spry.</p>\\n<p>I approached the wall in front of Helen, running full-tilt.\\xa0 I leaped, touching foot to the wall for extra leverage, and reached her hand.</p>\\n<p>I felt the intensity of the heat as she helped swing me over the fire.\\xa0 I only barely missed landing at the edge of the fire, and the moment I realized I\\u2019d touched safer ground was spoiled as burning floorboards cracked under my weight.</p>\\n<p>I reached out for Helen.\\xa0 She lunged off the wall in my direction, and I grabbed her, half-throwing, half-pushing her away.\\xa0 We sprawled across the floor, rolling over floorboards that licked with only small amounts of flame.</p>\\n<p>Avis was perched on the balcony, adjusting straps from her dress to tie them to her wing.\\xa0 In front of us, a ghost materialized from around the corner of the balcony.\\xa0 She approached us, a weapon in either hand.</p>\\n<p>I reached for my last knife, and then hesitated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s running!\\u201d I shouted.\\xa0 \\u201cCan I stop her!?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw Avis\\u2019 muscles tense.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p>I hurled the knife.</p>\\n<p>It caught Avis dead-center in the back.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t sink in point-first, but the side of the blade did hit.</p>\\n<p>Wings and limbs spasmed.\\xa0 She did too, her back arching, already tense muscles visibly twitching and pulling so tight they kinked up.\\xa0 I worried she\\u2019d tumble forward off the balcony and onto the soldiers waiting below.</p>\\n<p>Whatever it was she was wearing, it was akin to a large bug, running parallel to her spine.\\xa0 I\\u2019d injured it, but I shouldn\\u2019t have hurt Avis herself.</p>\\n<p><em>Hooked into her nervous system</em>.</p>\\n<p>The ghost that had stepped out was drawing nearer to Helen and I.\\xa0 I\\u2019d just thrown away my last weapon.\\xa0 There was only the bundled-up shirt,\\xa0 which had touched fire and ignited.</p>\\n<p>Helen and I fought to get to a standing position, an awkward process with growing stripes of flame here and there on the floor.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d Lillian cried out.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re on fire!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked.\\xa0 Sure enough, a section of my shorts was burning.\\xa0 I\\u2019d completely failed to notice, with the oppressive heat from the fire behind me.</p>\\n<p>I slapped at it with my hand, to little effect.</p>\\n<p>The ghost drew near, swift, picking and choosing where she stepped.</p>\\n<p>Touching the toe of my shoe to the bundled up shirt, I kicked up, directing it in the general direction of the ghost\\u2019s head.\\xa0 A fireball.</p>\\n<p>She sidestepped it in an awkward way, burning cloth brushing past her face, briefly disorienting her.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure if it was that the cloth was burning or the unsteady footing that led to the mistake.</p>\\n<p>It left Helen and I with no weapon to throw or use for self defense.\\xa0 The fire was so close I could have sworn my back was breaking open in blisters.</p>\\n<p>I reached into a pocket.\\xa0 Spare change.</p>\\n<p>I flung it at her.</p>\\n<p>This, she didn\\u2019t even try to dodge.\\xa0 It touched her and danced off, clattering to the floor.</p>\\n<p>She stumbled to a stop.\\xa0 She straightened, partially turning, and I could see the knife in her chest.</p>\\n<p><em>Good job, Mary</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>But, lethal as the knife should have been, the ghost didn\\u2019t stop.\\xa0 She stumbled forward, and the stumble became a run.</p>\\n<p>Bull-rushing us.</p>\\n<p>I pushed Helen against the wall, while I stepped out, parallel to the line of flame.\\xa0 The ghost decided to go for Helen, grabbing her, and using forward momentum to carry her directly into fire.\\xa0 The two stumbled into the blaze together.</p>\\n<p><em>No</em>.</p>\\n<p>I was only a step behind, not quite entering the flame, but getting close enough it <em>hurt</em>.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t see, the heat itself stealing away my ability to see as much as the smoke did, I could only intuit, lashing out as best as I could.</p>\\n<p>I kicked the knee.\\xa0 That knee buckled, and the ghost toppled.\\xa0 I grabbed her, tearing her down toward the ground as much as I did anything.\\xa0 Burned floorboards creaked precariously under her weight as she crashed down.</p>\\n<p>Helen reached over the ghost, seizing my shoulders, fingernails digging in for a grip.\\xa0 Unable to reach into fire, I instead hauled myself -and her- away and back, throwing the two of us to the ground for the second time.</p>\\n<p>She wasn\\u2019t as burned as I\\u2019d thought she\\u2019d be, but it was bad.\\xa0 Hair singed, skin burned across virtually every part of her that I could see, her dress was scorched, barely intact.</p>\\n<p>She wheezed for breath, starting to rise, then dropping, writhing until she found a position where she wasn\\u2019t touching burning floor.</p>\\n<p>I stood, grabbing her.\\xa0 I hauled on her arm, and I wasn\\u2019t strong enough to budge her.</p>\\n<p>The wheezing seemed to be getting worse by the second, and I wasn\\u2019t sure if it was my imagination or if it was the reality.\\xa0 It filled my ears, drowning out everything else, even the sound of the Duke\\u2019s pistol shots.</p>\\n<p>I turned my attention to Avis.</p>\\n<p>She had recovered from the spasming.\\xa0 One wing already lay curled up on the floor, folded into itself by way of far too many joints, a feathery, bloodstained ball.\\xa0 As I watched, she hauled on the matching, smaller wing, tearing it out of the socket.\\xa0 It curled up like the other had, the pair of them like legs of a dead spider furling beneath it.</p>\\n<p>She flexed her remaining pair of wings, glancing my way.\\xa0 She backed away a little, I let go of Helen\\u2019s hand to approach.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow many of you are left?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnough,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs it worth it?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWorking for them?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not working for them,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot this time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her eyebrows went up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe kids you killed to make those ghosts of yours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re not ghosts,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re alive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a name,\\u201d I said, annoyed, angry she was going on about stupid garbage when my friends were hurt and in danger.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she told me.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re alive.\\xa0 The children you say we killed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re lying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s no way to bring clones up to speed as fast as we did without a shortcut, Sylvester,\\u201d Avis said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe bodies were material.\\xa0 The brains?\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t much different from making a stitched.\\xa0 Keep the essentials.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I thought of what Mary had said about the other Percy.</p>\\n<p>That he wasn\\u2019t <em>him</em>, the little things were different.</p>\\n<p>Tics.\\xa0 Muscle memory, way of standing, way of walking.</p>\\n<p>I believed her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe children?\\xa0 You\\u2019ve been killing them, not us,\\u201d Avis said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou took the part that mattered.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Something cracked as the fire ate away at structural integrity.\\xa0 There was a violent snap, and something tumbled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you jump,\\u201d I said, \\u201cThen I\\u2019m jumping after you.\\xa0 I\\u2019m going to grab your wings.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re strong enough to carry both of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are reasons,\\u201d the Duke said, \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t yet made man fly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d emerged, stepping around the other end of the wall.\\xa0 He, Avis and I formed a proper triangle, with Avis at the balcony.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAt best, four wings and some vigorous flapping, she could glide.\\xa0 Two wings?\\xa0 She can hope to try and control her spiral to the ground.\\xa0 With luck, she\\u2019d even avoid the worst of the bullets and find a place to run from.\\xa0 With a Lamb latched onto you, Avis, you\\u2019ll plummet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe might not catch hold of me on his way down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My gaze was cold.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m willing to try.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Something told me she believed me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWill we have our duel after all?\\u201d the Duke asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been handicapped.\\xa0 I was stabbed no less than thirteen times.\\xa0 One pole of some sort was thrust through my leg.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He barely showed it, though blood ran down his clothing and dripped from a few spots here and there.\\xa0 There was a steady and unbroken stream of blood trailing down from the wound in his cheek to the edge of his chin, where it carried on.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t give you the satisfaction.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t imagine any sort of true satisfaction,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 He was smiling.\\xa0 He spread his arms, and he looked like the giant of a man he was, especially in contrast to Avis\\u2019 frail form.\\xa0 \\u201cA <em>snack</em> of a conflict, rather than a meal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith all due respect, my lord,\\u201d I said, not taking my eyes off Avis- I fully expected her to make the leap at any second.\\xa0 I said, \\u201cWhere the heck are you taking in your meals?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot here.\\xa0 But <em>home</em>?\\xa0 I\\u2019ve always sparred with my brothers and sister.\\xa0 <em>That\\u2019s</em> a meal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re making this out to be something trivial?\\u201d Avis asked, eyes narrowed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou <em>are</em> trivial,\\u201d the Duke said, with the confidence that nothing else was even possible.</p>\\n<p>She shook her head.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re everything that\\u2019s wrong with the world.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I glanced back at Helen.\\xa0 The fire wasn\\u2019t too near her.\\xa0 I wondered if it was even possible to talk to the Duke and ask him to move her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were lucky enough to grow up in a world my family created, Avis,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne where you haven\\u2019t seen the <em>true</em> ugliness of mankind, and you can actually believe what you just said.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven before the Crown became what it is, before Wollstone, the world got better, decade after decade, century after century.\\xa0 The people of the world were happier, healthier and longer-lived than those who came before.\\xa0 From stone age to bronze age to iron age-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd then the dark age,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p>She shook her head.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 We were still progressing.\\xa0 We had a way forward.\\xa0 The age of machinery, then the age of blood.\\xa0 The last age, where we look <em>inward</em>.\\xa0 But you\\u2019ve perverted it.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve made it about power, for you.\\xa0 Powerlessness for everyone else.\\xa0 Ask your people, the ones who serve the Crown, and three out of five will tell you you\\u2019re <em>wrong</em>, you\\u2019re <em>loathed</em>.\\xa0 The other one or two out of five, I\\u2019m not sure they\\u2019re just too scared to say it out loud.\\xa0 Your wars, your breaches of everything that\\u2019s right-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs temporary,\\u201d I cut in, without thinking.</p>\\n<p>The Duke gave me a look, his chin rising a fraction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn this, we might agree, Sylvester,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She fixed her eyes on the Duke.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Crown is a temporary power.\\xa0 It <em>has</em> to be.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, not like that.\\xa0 You\\u2019re wrong about something.\\xa0 The age of blood isn\\u2019t the last one.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a final expanse.\\xa0 The mind, the brain.\\xa0 Once we unravel <em>that</em><em>, </em>we\\u2019ll be able to see a way through.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course you\\u2019d say that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf <em>course</em> of course!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I allowed myself a half second to wish I had the Wyvern formula to help me better formulate my rebuttals.\\xa0 \\u201cI know how stupid people are!\\xa0 I can see it in half the people I talk to, I veer from stupidity to brilliance!\\xa0 I <em>know!</em>\\xa0 We have to be patient.\\xa0 We have to keep from destroying ourselves in the meantime.\\xa0 <em>We</em> have to keep the likes of <em>you</em> from destroying <em>them</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>From destroying us</em>.</p>\\n<p>I thought of Helen, of the others, beaten, battered, and in danger.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s how you justify yourself?\\xa0 That\\u2019s really how you see it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Yes.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re such a child,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith the abilities of an adult,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA far cry from <em>being</em> adult,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She heaved out a sigh, wings flexing.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t think I have many ways out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou never did,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll chance being shot.\\xa0 If you want to catch me on the way down, feel free to try.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Then she started to topple backward over the railing.\\xa0 The Duke lifted his pistol, aiming skyward, rather than shooting.</p>\\n<p>I bolted, running.</p>\\n<p>I <em>felt</em> rather than saw the movement of the knife, just to my left.</p>\\n<p>It raked her shoulder, and it caught her wing.\\xa0 Feathers and fire-resistant powder flew into the air.\\xa0 I saw her eyes, already wide and bloodshot, go wider.</p>\\n<p>I dropped, throwing myself forward.\\xa0 I reached past the rails of the railing, grabbing-</p>\\n<p>I seized a strap of her top with both hands.\\xa0 Her weight dragged me forward, my head and ribs slamming into the rails.\\xa0 I managed to keep my grip.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet me go,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 Her fingernails bit into my arm.\\xa0 \\u201cLet.\\xa0 Go!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My fingers started to give.\\xa0 She was lighter than she should\\u2019ve been, more modifications, no doubt, but I wasn\\u2019t strong.\\xa0 I felt a pain in my hands that suggested they\\u2019d be hurting for days.</p>\\n<p>And then the burden was lifted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPower, and powerlessness, hm?\\u201d I heard the Duke speak, close.</p>\\n<p>The Duke loomed over me.\\xa0 He grabbed her as she kicked and fought, and held her so she was face to face with him.\\xa0 An angel with the face of a demon and a demon with the face of an angel.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d enhanced her strength with the combat drug, but for purposes far from fighting the Duke.\\xa0 Only to fly, or to make the attempt.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t up to fighting the Duke, even as he drew a syringe from one pocket and plunged it into her neck.</p>\\n<p>I disengaged myself from the railing, clutching hands to my chest.\\xa0 I turned to face the burning building interior.</p>\\n<p>It hadn\\u2019t been Mary to throw the knife that injured the wing, but Jamie.\\xa0 He was at the edge of the balcony now, standing by Helen\\u2019s body, and by Lillian, who was tending to Helen.\\xa0 They had to have crossed the fire the same way Helen and I did.</p>\\n<p>Surprising, on a number of levels.</p>\\n<p>Helen was breathing.\\xa0 She was alive.\\xa0 With Lillian there, she\\u2019d stay alive.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood enough,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 He was smiling like he\\u2019d just had the time of his life.\\xa0 The fact that Claret Hall was burning down hardly mattered.\\xa0 He raised his voice, loud enough for the crowd below and the pair\\u2019s sensitive ears to hear, halfway around the building, \\u201cDog, Catcher!\\xa0 The Lambs need a way down!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He reached out with a free hand and touched the top of my head as he passed by, entering the building to collect the other Lambs and workers.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I stared at the surreal image.\\xa0 When we could no longer see him, his body cloaked by smoke and fire, there was a moment where we were supposed to speak, to look at each other, to joke.</p>\\n<p>I felt the absence of that moment keenly.</p>\\n<p><a

said.</p>\\n<p>Ashton stared at the boy, uncomprehending.\\xa0 Here we go again?\\xa0 What did he mean?</p>\\n<p>He said a lot of things that were hard to puzzle out.</p>\\n<p>Understanding was important, the people back home kept saying.\\xa0 Had to learn, had to study.\\xa0 Ashton was here to study by experiencing.\\xa0 But Ashton had more questions than there was time to ask.\\xa0 If he started asking then he might never stop.\\xa0 Jamie didn\\u2019t mind, but Jamie wasn\\u2019t the only person here.\\xa0 The train car was packed with people, and people that listened to Ashton speak for too long had a way of acting funny and getting concerned.</p>\\n<p>Then he had to make them less concerned.</p>\\n<p>But that was a problem too, Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>Click click click click.\\xa0 Hard shoes tapped the floor of the train car.</p>\\n<p><em>Here we go again</em>, Ashton realized.\\xa0 It was the woman again.\\xa0 He turned his head, looking up, just as she came into view.\\xa0 She was tall and pale and had dark hair.\\xa0 She was more like the pictures of pretty ladies they had shown Ashton than the pictures of the ugly people.\\xa0 That was a hard thing to figure out.\\xa0 If he paid too much attention to what made people pretty, the parts of the face, then he still made mistakes.</p>\\n<p>Jamie had figured that out first, after watching Ashton\\u2019s class on people, faces, and acting.\\xa0 Jamie had found a medical textbook and showed it to Ashton, and Ashton had called the woman in that book pretty.\\xa0 That upset a lot of people.\\xa0 They asked him questions and Jamie said that the way her face was shaped, the shape of her eye, the look of her eyebrows, nose and mouth all seemed right.</p>\\n<p>But the drawing of the woman in the book had a problem with the eye.\\xa0 The woman here had no scar on her face, no missing parts, no pocks or poxes.\\xa0 She looked young and smooth and wore makeup with a uniform that meant she was a member of the staff.</p>\\n<p>She put a hand on Ashton\\u2019s head as she leaned in between the two benches the Lambs sat on.\\xa0 \\u201cCan I get you anything?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said, sounding tired.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have biscuits in the staff\\u2019s car.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve mentioned the biscuits,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo thank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething to drink?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said, firmly.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you.\\xa0 We need some privacy, please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe train arrives shortly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he said, for the hundredth time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll give you a hand when you step off the train.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo need.\\xa0 Thank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo need,\\u201d Ashton echoed Gordon, voice soft.\\xa0 He was bad at controlling his volume for different situations, so he spoke quietly just to be sure.\\xa0 Most people listened when he talked.</p>\\n<p>The woman walked away.\\xa0 Ashton stared at her, watching her go.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that,\\u201d Sylvester asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThirty times?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThirty-one.\\xa0 Close,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBully for me,\\u201d Sylvester said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou need to learn some control, Ash,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Ashton said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a problem?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s annoying,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re supposed to be <em>covert</em>.\\xa0 Having people flocking to us?\\xa0 Not covert.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could push her away.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think that would be a horrible idea,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cLook.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ashton stared at the point of Jamie\\u2019s finger.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 His expression and tone were <em>patient</em>.\\xa0 Ashton remembered that lesson.\\xa0 \\u201cImagine a line, drawn along my arm and out past the point my finger extends, where does that line go?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ashton knew his brain didn\\u2019t work like a human\\u2019s did.\\xa0 When he imagined something new, he had to work to do it, and the things he imagined overwrote the things he saw.\\xa0 The line appeared, red because Ashton preferred the color red.\\xa0 He followed it, head turning, and had to work to correct it so it was mostly straight.</p>\\n<p>Sitting across the aisle was a family.\\xa0 The two younger children and the mom were staring at the Lambs.\\xa0 The mom raised her hand in a small wave, smiling.\\xa0 Behind the family was a window, looking out on fields and trees.\\xa0 An orchard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m pointing at the family.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ashton nodded.\\xa0 Nodding was the thing people did when they wanted to say \\u2018yes\\u2019 or to agree, but didn\\u2019t want to say something.\\xa0 He was supposed to nod if he would say yes more than twice in a very short time, which was often when he was getting a lot of instructions.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t supposed to talk too much until he learned how conversations worked, so he\\u2019d chosen to nod.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you try to make people go away, it makes them feel uneasy, scared, sick, or angry,\\u201d Jamie said, his voice quieter than before.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s hand had gone back to his lap, and the red line that stretched out from his fingertip was pointed at the train car wall under the window.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you do that in this train car, where people have been breathing you in for a long time\\u2026?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ashton looked around.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChaos and panic?\\u201d Sylvester suggested.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI was asking <em>Ashton</em>, though, because it was a teachable moment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Chaos and panic.</p>\\n<p>Ashton watched as people all around him started getting up from their seats, hitting each other, pushing, trying to get away.\\xa0 He could hear them as they made noise.\\xa0 They weren\\u2019t real people, only his imagination, and he wasn\\u2019t good at imagining people.\\xa0 The blood-stained pictures in his mind\\u2019s eye were distorted, the faces weren\\u2019t symmetrical \\u2013 that was the part about the one-eyed woman\\u2019s face that the acting teacher had explained was important \\u2013 and some had only one eye, or eyes in the wrong place, or stretched out black circles for mouths.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d seen a lot of blood spatters during and after the fighting in Brechwell.\\xa0 The organ structures in his head, described as coral-like in appearance by one of his doctors, were busy calling those images from his memories, painting them around the train car.\\xa0 Sometimes the scale was wrong, or it was the wrong angle, against the wrong surface.</p>\\n<p>But he was supposed to practice, and it was pretty enough to look at, so he let the images and the spatters and the dead bodies keep overlapping, even though none of it made sense anymore.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was talking, he realized.\\xa0 He made the imagined-hallucinated screams stop so he could understand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-when he gets more control.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNuanced,\\u201d Sylvester said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe hope,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>Ashton nodded.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t wholly sure that he understood what they were saying, but sitting still and doing nothing bothered people sometimes.\\xa0 Jamie said he was supposed to practice when and how he spoke and participated, even if he got it wrong, but only with the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s interesting,\\u201d Sylvester said.\\xa0 \\u201cFiguring out how to move this particular game piece, with all of the inherent problems it brings to the picture.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGame pieces?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIs that how you see us?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly when we\\u2019re playing a game, Lil,\\u201d Sylvester said.\\xa0 He looked to one side and then groaned.</p>\\n<p>Click click click click\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have mints in my purse, if you\\u2019d like-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you, miss.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, I just thought you should know the train is stopping now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll help you with your bags.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo need.\\xa0 Thank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ashton turned his head to look up at the woman.\\xa0 His imagination had the father from across the aisle swing the smallest of the children by one ankle, the head cracking open against the back of Ashton\\u2019s seat.\\xa0 Blood flew into the woman\\u2019s face.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t move or flinch.</p>\\n<p>That was false.</p>\\n<p>He was supposed to practice.\\xa0 He imagined it happening again, her expression changing.\\xa0 What were the right emotions?\\xa0 Disgust and fear.\\xa0 The two put together, what was it?\\xa0 Horror.</p>\\n<p>He watched the scene replay, over and over, trying to piece it together until it looked like something that should happen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAshton,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cPay attention.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ashton realized the woman was gone.\\xa0 The scene broke down into constituent parts, those parts scattering.\\xa0 He turned back to Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t forget your umbrella,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t open it until we\\u2019re out of the train car,\\u201d Jamie corrected.</p>\\n<p>Ashton bent down and picked up his umbrella.\\xa0 The others were getting their coats on.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t have one, because using an umbrella was easier than remembering how to get dressed in a way that didn\\u2019t draw attention.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTry to focus, okay?\\xa0 I know you and Jamie aren\\u2019t facing the same danger as the rest of us, but what comes next matters.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ashton nodded.</p>\\n<p>Focus.\\xa0 He stopped practicing.\\xa0 The images went away, one by one.\\xa0 He looked across the aisle, and the images there went away too.</p>\\n<p>The train stopped before he was finished.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs made their way out, grabbing their bags from the compartment by the door.\\xa0 The man at the bottom of the stairs down to the train platform helped each of them, smiling at Ashton as Ashton stared up at him.</p>\\n<p>There was a group waiting for them.\\xa0 Ashton\\u2019s doctors were among them.\\xa0 The department heads, the new Academy Headmaster, Professor Hayle, Professor Ibott, and a number of others Ashton didn\\u2019t recognize stood at a point just past the exit from the station.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHoo boy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Ashton watched the family that had been across the aisle walk past.\\xa0 The youngest child\\u2019s head was imagined-hallucinated to be broken apart from when his head had been smashed against the back of the seat, contents leaking out.\\xa0 Brains were gray but they looked pink when seen fresh because of the blood in and on them.\\xa0 Ashton left the little boy like he was, because it was pretty, and because red was his favorite color.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p><strong>Gordon</strong></p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s hand reached down to find Hubris\\u2019 head.\\xa0 He gave it a pat and a scratch, more for his own security than for Hubris.\\xa0 Mary stood beside him.\\xa0 That was security of another sort.</p>\\n<p>Scares like this were bad for his heart.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLord Duke, Lord, Headmaster, esteemed professors,\\u201d Gordon greeted the committee in his best guess at order of hierarchy.\\xa0 There was a new noble as part of the group, and Gordon didn\\u2019t recognize the man.</p>\\n<p>The Duke and the new noble were wearing hunting clothes, pants clinging to their legs, long jackets.\\xa0 The noble in the Duke\\u2019s company was younger, no older than eighteen, as far as age could be estimated by appearance when a noble was concerned.\\xa0 He had a pointed, jutting chin, stood tall at seven feet, narrow and long-necked.\\xa0 A swan turned human.\\xa0 Graceful, imperious, and, Gordon knew, swans were absolute bastards when met face to face.</p>\\n<p>Like the Duke, the man\\u2019s hair was long and golden, but his hair was straight and flowed straight down his back, more supple than hair should be.\\xa0 He wore a checkered scarf in yellow and black.\\xa0 His teeth, as he smiled, seemed wrong somehow, too uniform and white, and his fingers were especially long, poking out of the embroidered sleeve of a hunting jacket.\\xa0 The nails were long and sharp, and the fingers were marked with jewelry.</p>\\n<p>He wore a sword, Gordon noted.\\xa0 Noble anatomy, modified to be stronger, faster, inhuman by most measures.\\xa0 Gordon couldn\\u2019t say why, but he had the vague sense that the man could and would draw and use that sword to dispatch anyone who insulted him.</p>\\n<p>Sylvester would be able to say why he gave off that impression, Gordon knew.\\xa0 All Gordon had in this situation were his instincts.\\xa0 He\\u2019d heard of the mad nobles, the dangerous ones, and this one felt more dangerous than even the Duke.</p>\\n<p><em>Please don\\u2019t talk, Sylvester</em>.\\xa0 <em>Don\\u2019t say anything</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is the Baron Richmond,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cA cousin.\\xa0 We were near Brechwell when we heard of the situation in Brechwell.\\xa0 Genevieve Fray spotted and effectively cornered.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lower in status than the Duke by six orders of nobility, Gordon estimated.\\xa0 He wouldn\\u2019t speak out of turn.\\xa0 That was good.\\xa0 Gordon could imagine the man establishing his presence through violence and the making of examples.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWalk with us,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cYour bags will be looked after.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s, \\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d joined a number of others.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t even wait to see if the Lambs listened.\\xa0 The Baron fell in step beside the Duke with no trouble.\\xa0 The pair walked fast enough that their retinue and the other professors had to work to keep up.\\xa0 For the Lambs, especially the smaller ones, Ashton and Sylvester, that was doubly difficult.</p>\\n<p>The crowd parted, people already had their heads and eyes toward the ground.\\xa0 As the Duke advanced, people of all social classes dropped to their knees on the damp road.\\xa0 It was as though an invisible wave preceded him, knocking people down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho have we lost to her side?\\u201d the Duke asked.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t turn around.</p>\\n<p>The Baron was watching over one shoulder.\\xa0 Gordon felt uneasy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOut of the superweapons, Dog and Catcher, to be sure, my lord.\\xa0 Petey was confirmed.\\xa0 Most of the rest, but we can\\u2019t be sure who,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Baron has been arguing that you\\u2019re more liability than asset,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe don\\u2019t know where the Lambs stand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Baron is wrong,\\u201d Sylvester said, adding a belated, \\u201cMy lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon momentarily closed his eyes.\\xa0 Hearing Sylvester speak, even before the sentence was finished, had Gordon\\u2019s heart skipping a beat.\\xa0 Cognitively, he <em>knew</em> Sylvester had gauged the situation and no doubt gauged it well.\\xa0 But there was no room for even small errors, not here.</p>\\n<p>The Baron had a dangerous look in his eye, but he hadn\\u2019t spoken.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think so?\\u201d the Duke asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d Sylvester said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI said much the same thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d Sylvester said.\\xa0 Gordon could hear the note of smug satisfaction in Sylvester\\u2019s voice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Provided</em> we decide you\\u2019re trustworthy,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ll give your report to the professors, the Baron and I will look over the written transcripts, and we\\u2019ll give the final judgments.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d Gordon said, before Sylvester could speak.\\xa0 He couldn\\u2019t let Sylvester take command of this conversation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy sisters will want to participate as well,\\u201d the Baron said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think so?\\u201d the Duke asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ve been so bored, and have complained about being left out of the hunting trip.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery well, the twins as well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>The twins.\\xa0 </em>The words were akin to a bell in Gordon\\u2019s memory.</p>\\n<p>Gordon had heard of the twins.\\xa0 To be exact, he\\u2019d heard about them in the context of the mad nobles.\\xa0 On the flip side, mention of mad nobles as a general topic invariably meant mention of the twins.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLittle Helen, I think the Baron, Baronets and I would enjoy your company after all is said and done, should you be cleared of wrongdoing or dissent.\\xa0 You and Professor Ibbot shall join us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d Helen said, curtsying without slowing so much it mattered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m honored, my lord,\\u201d Ibott squawked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, yes,\\u201d the Duke said, sounding annoyed the man had spoken.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf they <em>aren\\u2019t</em> cleared of wrongdoing, we should have them join us for company all the same,\\u201d the Baron said, still staring at Sylvester.\\xa0 \\u201cAs I said, my sisters have been bored.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wonder if I haven\\u2019t read a fairy tale about something like that,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt seems unwise to invite a group of assassins over for company and amusement, especially if they\\u2019ve been proven as traitors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne at a time, then.\\xa0 Or send their creators in with them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPerhaps.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon could see Ibott react to that.</p>\\n<p>Hubris touched his nose to Gordon\\u2019s hand.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s heart was thumping.\\xa0 It was a limping struggle, one side stronger than the other.</p>\\n<p>By all rights, he should have stopped walking and let it calm down and find its rhythm again.\\xa0 He kept up the pace.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat in mind, I would recommend we err on the more conservative side of things,\\u201d the Baron said.</p>\\n<p>The Duke, still leading the group as they walked up to the Academy, smiled at that.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d ask if you meant conservative in the sense of preserving more of our Academy\\u2019s hard work, or conservative in avoiding potential traitors in our midst, but it would be a rhetorical question, dear Richmond.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be paying close attention to the verdict,\\u201d the Baron said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I\\u2019m dissatisfied with the result, I\\u2019ll see that corrections are made.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>If he doesn\\u2019t get the guilty verdict, then heads roll.\\xa0 Or whatever he and his sisters do to amuse themselves.\\xa0 </em>The Baron was a mad one too, then.</p>\\n<p>That would make for a fairly emotional discussion.\\xa0 Some of the people in the meeting that were discussing whether the Lambs were too dangerous or not were in danger regardless of what happened.</p>\\n<p>Jory, Gordon\\u2019s head doctor, glanced back, offering a worried look.\\xa0 He was one of them.</p>\\n<p>No trust.\\xa0 Mary got along with her doctors, at least to the point of being able to have conversations.\\xa0 Jamie did too.\\xa0 Had and still did, presumably.\\xa0 Sylvester\\u2026 didn\\u2019t get along with most.\\xa0 But Gordon\\u2019s team was a big one.\\xa0 The conversations had been limited to small talk, a duty that seemed to be rotated between staff members to the point that little familiarity was established.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell us,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cA prelude to the interrogations.\\xa0 What <em>did</em> you accomplish?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe know her plan, my Lord,\\u201d Sylvester said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe creator of the Ghosts is dead, my Lord,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be my creator,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary had a strong hand in how that unfolded.\\xa0 We couldn\\u2019t have done it without her,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWith that settled, we can hope they don\\u2019t have the resources to keep developing and improving on that project, which we know was tying up our resources.\\xa0 With luck, the project might die altogether.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd Fray herself?\\u201d the Duke asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t have the manpower to stop her ourselves, with our forces distracted and other experiments turning coat, but we were able to make a last minute maneuver and steer the city\\u2019s superweapon her way.\\xa0 A number of her people were injured.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas Genevieve Fray?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo reports of such, Lord Duke.\\xa0 She has Avis, wearing wings, as well as a brute of a man in her company, they could have scaled to a safer height or forced their way through a set of doors or a window.\\xa0 We were talking about it earlier, but it didn\\u2019t sound as if she was successful in forming the alliance between the different factions,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExplain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>This was where he bent the truth.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t have the deserved reputation of a liar that Sylvester did.\\xa0 He had the undeserved reputation as the honest one.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLord Duke,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIn part, our actions disrupted the already tenuous negotiations between Genevieve Fray and Cynthia.\\xa0 Cynthia split off to charge through the Academy\\u2019s lines.\\xa0 Mauer\\u2019s side was displeased with how things were going before that, we killed one of his lieutenants, something that wouldn\\u2019t have happened if he hadn\\u2019t come to Fray\\u2019s meeting, and our final move, delivered with the Brechwell Beast, primarily hurt Mauer\\u2019s elite group of soldiers and may have even hurt Mauer himself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou believe he\\u2019ll be at odds with her?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI believe, my lord,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cthat he won\\u2019t be as sympathetic to her as he might be if things had played out otherwise.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd here I\\u2019d actually thought I had to invite my cousin to visit in order to hear someone tell me so very little of substance with so many words,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou wound me,\\u201d the Baron said.\\xa0 The Duke smiled, but it was faintly derisive.\\xa0 Gordon wondered if even close friendships in the Duke\\u2019s world were combative and bitter.</p>\\n<p>Hubris nudged Gordon\\u2019s hand again.</p>\\n<p><em>It\\u2019s okay, boy.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to be vague, my lord,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 His heart hitched, and he bit back a gasp.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m aware that if I\\u2019m <em>too</em> specific, and something contradicts the specifics, it will look bad.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery true.\\xa0 I have missed the Lambs.\\xa0 I so often find I have to hunt for intellectual company, even among professors and supposed geniuses.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>They were approaching the Academy gates now.\\xa0 The armed guard at the gate parted, the gates opening as that invisible wave of presence extended out to touch it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll be taking our leave.\\xa0 I did promise Baron Richmond a hunt today, we\\u2019ll be visiting the underground labs to see what can be loosed.\\xa0 Keep the Lambs separate, watch for their hand-signs, see to their appointments after or during, so we can be sure they won\\u2019t coordinate or correct one another\\u2019s stories.\\xa0 Though I imagine they would have already, were they lying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, my lord,\\u201d Sylvester said.</p>\\n<p>Both the Duke and the Baron looked back at Sylvester.\\xa0 Most of the Professors did too, the ones with their lives on the line looking aghast.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we were lying, my lord,\\u201d Sy said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou are very fortunate you amuse me, Sylvester,\\u201d the Duke said, sounding far from amused.</p>\\n<p>Then the Duke was gone, talking to the Baron as they walked.\\xa0 The group remained where it was, the crowd that had parted remained still, almost as if it was in shock, unsure if it was safe to resume going about their day.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIndoors,\\u201d the new Headmaster spoke.\\xa0 \\u201cNo talking.\\xa0 It\\u2019s bad enough some of my superweapons have turned, I\\u2019m not about to lose my head, or half of my staff.\\xa0 Radham Academy has to recover from this.\\xa0 We do this perfectly, giving the Baron no excuse to target us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It wouldn\\u2019t matter, Gordon knew.</p>\\n<p>Claret Hall wasn\\u2019t far from the entrance.\\xa0 Some staff broke away to look after other business.\\xa0 The Lambs weren\\u2019t among them.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s left hand went to his chest, rubbing at the sternum, as if he could somehow massage what lay within.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t settling.</p>\\n<p>Beside him, Mary took his other hand.\\xa0 It was only when he felt the warmth of her hand that he realized how cold he\\u2019d gotten.</p>\\n<p>His interaction with her had happened so gradually he wasn\\u2019t sure when it had unfolded.\\xa0 She\\u2019d started expressing interest some time after he\\u2019d broken it off with Shipman, through little gestures, going out of her way to spend time with him, to practice, showing him her knife throwing so he could improve his own.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d stayed at arm\\u2019s length, because he knew Sylvester had feelings of his own for the girl, as well as a kind of possessive attachment.\\xa0 With anyone else, there might have been problems, but she\\u2019d kept <em>him</em> at arm\\u2019s length, too.</p>\\n<p>It had just been that.\\xa0 A pretty girl, regularly in his company.</p>\\n<p>But then Sy had started paying more attention to Lillian, and Gordon knew there was some manipulation there, Sy playing some matchmaking game, providing signals.\\xa0 Gordon had let it be what it was and stopped worrying about hurting their friendship.</p>\\n<p>Then this thing with Percy, and Mary had drawn close.</p>\\n<p>It was awfully easy to let her.\\xa0 All the rational reasons not to were suddenly very hard to bring up.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t some common <em>girl</em>, he could never stand the usual girls, not the ones nearer his own age at Lambsbridge, not the ones he\\u2019d seen associating with the mice, not the pretty ones at Mothmont.</p>\\n<p>He liked Mary like he still liked Shipman.\\xa0 Both were girls who demanded a special kind of respect, instead of being content to receive ordinary respect.\\xa0 Smart, dangerous, strong in their individual ways.\\xa0 But all of that was dressed up in <em>girl</em>.\\xa0 Not girlishness or femininity, but in the distilled reality of <em>girl</em>.\\xa0 He wanted to see more of them, hear them speak, touch them, taste them as he kissed them.\\xa0 The way Mary\\u2019s skirt moved as she walked made him feel like he\\u2019d just stepped outside to sun and fresh air, after years and years of rain and Radham air that smelled like smoke, blood, and manure.</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s explanation of her own desires were scarily in line with his own when put forward as an allegory for how strong his own feelings sometimes were.\\xa0 What had she said?\\xa0 \\u2018Feel every part of them with every part of myself?\\u2019</p>\\n<p>He glanced at her.\\xa0 She gestured.\\xa0 <em>Strength</em>.\\xa0 <em>Courage.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cNone of that,\\u201d someone barked, behind them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary lowered her hand.\\xa0 She smiled at him.</p>\\n<p>They would get through this.\\xa0 Looking at her like this, he could appreciate why people drew together, formed pairs, even with all of the difficulties of being in a relationship.</p>\\n<p>He imagined her face, contorted with a special kind of grief as she looked down on his body.</p>\\n<p>His desires and the new feeling of guilt joined the anxiety of the moment, the imminent questioning.\\xa0 The feelings didn\\u2019t mingle or mix, but remained discrete.\\xa0 A jigsaw set of emotions for a jigsaw body made of individual pieces that just so happened to be put together.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs were so similar in that way.\\xa0 The distinctions between each were clear.\\xa0 Yet the Lambs were to be split up.</p>\\n<p>The symbolic parallel gave him an uneasy feeling, as the Lambs were invited to sit on either side of the hallway, more than ten feet of space separating one Lamb from the next.\\xa0 The doctors and groups of doctors positioned themselves to better block line of sight.</p>\\n<p>He spent so much of his time worrying, these days.\\xa0 It would be so nice to stop dreading what came next and just focus on the present.\\xa0 The closer Mary was to him at a given point in time, the more he felt like he could do that.\\xa0 Probably why he\\u2019d been dwelling on her so much in the last few minutes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester first,\\u201d Hayle suggested.\\xa0 \\u201cI somehow feel like we\\u2019ll want to take what he says and keep it in mind as each of the other Lambs speak.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>So much worrying.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/07/28/esprit-de-corpse-5-1/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The old man stared out the window as he talked.\\xa0 The rain was coming down hard.\\xa0 Cups clinked softly as tea was poured, while the rain beat a drum on the roof.\\xa0 The entire building creaked with the way the wind blew the branches that extended from the outside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need soldiers,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have soldiers,\\u201d Cynthia replied.\\xa0 She was dressed in the latest fashion, with a shorter dress and a long jacket that hugged her body, corset-like bindings closing it at the front.\\xa0 \\u201cWe have three men for every one the Academy is prepared to field.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Avis shook her head, \\u201cThey have experiments, and regiments of stitched prepared for war.\\xa0 Even with the sabotage, one stitched is worth ten soldiers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d argue that,\\u201d Louis said.\\xa0 He was seeing to the tea.\\xa0 He looked like a proper hunter, with a plaid print to his jacket, the red and the black matching to his maroon slacks and fine leather boots.\\xa0 He was an odd pair, put next to Percy.\\xa0 Louis\\u2019 build was barrel-chested and muscular, he was clean-shaven, and his ginger hair was wavy, though cut in a flattering way.\\xa0 Percy was narrow, pale in complexion, with his straight black hair slicked back from a widow\\u2019s peak, his beard combed and mustache waxed, an early gray at the temples and corners of the mouth.</p>\\n<p>The old man favored a more moderate approach.\\xa0 Louis attracted attention because he was a manly sort, Percy because he was a scholar, likely the sort of teacher many schoolgirls had been enamored with, before the touch of grey reached his hair.\\xa0 The old man walked a middle ground, where he could go unnoticed in virtually any place in Radham.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, Louis, but I agree with Avis,\\u201d Percy said, picking up one cup of tea and walking over to hand it to Avis.</p>\\n<p>One or two members of the group snuck looks at the old man.\\xa0 He could see out of the corner of his eye.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAvis is right,\\u201d the old man said.</p>\\n<p>Tea in hand, smiling, Avis took a seat in the corner, dropping down with enough force that the birdcage next to her rocked, the occupants protesting shrilly.\\xa0 She put out one hand out to steady the cage, then set her tea down, one ankle folding over the other.\\xa0 Her dress was ten years out of fashion, following the lines of her body down to the ankle, a vest keeping the ruffles contained to the collar and the sleeves, but her hair and horn-rimmed glasses were in vogue.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to say why,\\u201d Cynthia suggested.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAvis can explain,\\u201d the old man said.\\xa0 He was more than capable, but he needed to curry favor where he could, and this would be one of the last times he interacted directly with the woman.\\xa0 Avis was too important.\\xa0 She was only one step away from being in complete control of all communications within Radham Academy, and she was charged with many of the more covert ones, the ones that necessitated flying messengers.</p>\\n<p>Avis liked to take her time before making a statement, which was a predilection that matched her <em>other</em> job well.\\xa0\\xa0 Everyone in the room waited, some patiently, some impatiently, for the woman to speak.</p>\\n<p>The old man quietly thanked Percy as tea appeared on the small table by the window.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave you ever seen a <em>real </em>fight, Cynthia?\\u201d Avis asked, sounding more than a little arrogant.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been in more real fights than I could count.\\xa0 It is, in fact, a large part of what Louis and I do here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll rephrase.\\xa0 Have you seen a battlefield?\\xa0 War?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Cynthia shook her head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have,\\u201d Louis said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith humans?\\u201d Avis pressed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was one of those humans.\\xa0 You know this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFrom <em>my</em> experience on battlefields, I know that when you send men into a fight, they\\u2019re scared.\\xa0 If you tell them they have to shoot or be shot, many will not shoot.\\xa0 Humans naturally trend toward wanting to survive and being part of a group.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd war doesn\\u2019t support either of the two?\\u201d Cynthia asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWar most <em>definitely</em> supports both,\\u201d Avis said.\\xa0 \\u201cHowever, it should be stressed that fighting in a war doesn\\u2019t.\\xa0 The difference feeds the endless restlessness between the nobility and the people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow very clever,\\u201d Cynthia said, in a droll tone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn an actual war, you\\u2019ll see two or more groups of people trying to poke their head up out of cover, work up the courage to aim their weapon and then pull the trigger to kill the other person.\\xa0 You have to twist their arms to make them go over the breach, you play on ideology, or you convince them, and I do very much mean <em>convince them</em>, that they have no other choice.\\xa0 A stitched has no such reservations.\\xa0 A stitched doesn\\u2019t tend to stop and turn tail when his friend next to him gets gunned down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not necessarily a good thing,\\u201d Louis said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s easy to lose an entire regiment to the same machine gun, if the man giving orders isn\\u2019t prepared.\\xa0 There are tradeoffs.\\xa0 The Academy needs infrastructure.\\xa0 While the war is ongoing, they won\\u2019t have it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Avis sipped at her tea, then said, \\u201cWe agree there.\\xa0 The logistics of it all\\u2026 so long as we have the roads blockaded and bombed, they can\\u2019t move from A to B.\\xa0 Without the trains and wagons coming in from the farms on the outskirts, they can\\u2019t eat or feed their experiments.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut,\\u201d Cynthia said, \\u201cyou said we need soldiers, Godwin?\\xa0 You\\u2019re not confident?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was a question she asked while already knowing the answer.\\xa0 She was very much in his camp, and she was informed.\\xa0 He had talked to her about this before.</p>\\n<p>Godwin took the question as his excuse to turn and face the occupants of the room.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not confident.\\xa0 Things are still preliminary, the people are on our side, but we\\u2019re not moving forward, and the Academy is figuring out solutions.\\xa0 It\\u2019s what they do.\\xa0 The Academy retook Westmoreland.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe mountains of Columbia are the Academy\\u2019s primary mining operation in the west,\\u201d Cynthia said, for the benefit of the others present.\\xa0 \\u201cWestmoreland, Columbia is the second highest producer of weapons for the Crown States.\\xa0 For as long as they have it operational, they\\u2019re going to be armed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Godwin nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a coup for them.\\xa0 They\\u2019re going to start retaking ground.\\xa0 On the large scale, with Westmoreland, and on the small scale, <em>here</em>.\\xa0 They\\u2019re nosing around, looking for us, specifically, and they\\u2019re getting close.\\xa0 There were advantages to being in Radham, our close contact with Avis foremost among them-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d Avis said, preening.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-But the risks are too great.\\xa0 We were able to lead things in the abstract, now we need to be more direct.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll need to split up.\\xa0 Each of us in a different city.\\xa0 To be effective whilst we\\u2019re doing that, we\\u2019ll need soldiers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd the regular rank and file won\\u2019t do?\\u201d Louis asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThose are men.\\xa0 I believe we need more capable individuals.\\xa0 As of right now, odd as it may sound, Academy dropouts and individuals like Mr. Percy here are in <em>higher</em> demand than the best the Academy has to offer.\\xa0 The Academy\\u2019s people currently have no other choice but to work for the Academy, but the people who have the knowledge and lack the loyalty\\u2026 they can be swayed to either side, and they\\u2019re favoring ours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He had the rapt attention of everyone present.\\xa0 Louis seemed most comfortable hearing all of this, and was busy pouring himself another cup of tea.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll reach out, speak to some people, and I\\u2019ll have the money.\\xa0 What I need you to do right now is <em>find </em>the people with the necessary skills.\\xa0 The Academy has been quietly removing quite a number of them.\\xa0 Mr. Percy was one close call in that respect.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll find them and make them offers they can\\u2019t refuse.\\xa0 If the money doesn\\u2019t sway, quietly let them know we have the <em>knowledge, </em>and if you feel they\\u2019re worth the risk, we\\u2019ll go a step further and actually tell them who we are, inviting them to the inner circle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The others nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll miss this,\\u201d Cynthia said.\\xa0 \\u201cLosing the more intimate setting, having a voice without shouting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t imagine you shouting,\\u201d Percy said.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia smiled at that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor the time being, focus on staying safe, make sure you aren\\u2019t being followed, particularly by Dogs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr little children,\\u201d Percy said, frowning.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEspecially little children,\\u201d Godwin agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cLouis.\\xa0 A man named Reverend Mauer is managing one of the larger and more successful revolutionary groups.\\xa0 I think you and he would complement each other nicely.\\xa0 Would you reach out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd Cynthia, we\\u2019ve already discussed it-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlready doing what I can.\\xa0 They\\u2019re slippery, and they don\\u2019t want to be found.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Godwin nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cPercy?\\xa0 Keep doing what you\\u2019re doing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like to think I\\u2019m making soldiers rather than recruiting them,\\u201d Percy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou are, indeed,\\u201d Godwin said.\\xa0 He took a sip of his tea.\\xa0 \\u201cThe most dangerous time and place for you is when you\\u2019re on your way from Radham to your new accommodations.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich are where?\\u201d Avis asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll let you know in private,\\u201d Godwin said.\\xa0 He frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cFrom here on out, we\\u2019re operating in cells.\\xa0 I trust each of you.\\xa0 Do as you deem appropriate.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll each be in touch with one other cell.\\xa0 If you find you can\\u2019t reach them, then and only then should you reach out to me or Avis.\\xa0 Make preparations.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll meet in the morning, I\\u2019ll let you know particulars, and you\\u2019ll each leave.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo soon,\\u201d Cynthia said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight now, we\\u2019re safe, we\\u2019re free, we have control of the roads and the railroad.\\xa0 In two days, that might change,\\u201d Godwin said.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia frowned, but she didn\\u2019t argue.</p>\\n<p>The others were already standing, and the ones who weren\\u2019t wearing jackets pulled some on, with many getting umbrellas.\\xa0 Cynthia lagged behind the rest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, by the by, for the tea, Louis,\\u201d Godwin said.\\xa0 \\u201cI enjoyed that one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re very welcome,\\u201d Louis said.\\xa0 \\u201cI left you a small box of the teabags.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood lad,\\u201d Godwin said.</p>\\n<p>Percy and Louis left together, with Avis a few paces behind.</p>\\n<p>The door clicked shut.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia took a moment to pick up the scattered saucers and teacups, holding two in each hand on her way to the little sink.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething on your mind?\\u201d Godwin asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPercy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe told him that all of his creations were destroyed by the Lambs.\\xa0 If he discovers that they recruited one of them\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s very passionate, whatever he expresses on the surface.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat a very inconvenient man.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA very good way of putting it,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d hoped to discard him, but he has a damnable way of making himself essential.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll watch him,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI just wondered if you had any thoughts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He went through the little building and extinguished lights, then pulled on his raincloak.\\xa0 He joined her in exiting the building.</p>\\n<p>They were joined by the pair of experiments that had been standing in the hallway.\\xa0 Cynthia\\u2019s.\\xa0 The things were tall, narrower around than even the lithe Cynthia, and draped in rain cloaks that dragged on the ground.\\xa0 Each had large eyes and bat\\u2019s ears placed on otherwise underformed and unadorned faces.\\xa0 Chinless, noseless, the mouths frozen in a perpetual expression of a child that had just put a ball through a stained glass window.\\xa0 Neither blinked as rainwater ran down from their too-short foreheads and over the balls of the eyes, or even bounced off the orbs themselves.</p>\\n<p>Radham glowed, even at night.\\xa0 Temporary lamps with flickering bioluminescent lights within were placed at regular intervals between the regular lights, giving the patroling squadrons of stitched soldiers a better view of the surroundings.\\xa0 It was only approaching sundown, but the rain came down hard, and the gloom gave the impression of a later hour than it really was.\\xa0 Bridging the gap between winter and spring, it was an especially cold rain, cutting right through the raincloak, flesh and muscle to dig into the bone.</p>\\n<p>The eyes of a dozen stitched soldiers watched as the two of them walked down the length of the street, unblinking.\\xa0 The heads of the stitched moved slowly to track them, each of them moving in unison.</p>\\n<p>The riots had been quelled, but the fact that Radham needed to keep a boot on the throat of this downed enemy was a win.\\xa0 It bred resentment, and it limited how freely Radham could move.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia spoke up, when they were out of earshot of the stitched.\\xa0 \\u201cI was thinking.\\xa0 Lambert Academy, in Greysolon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Godwin casually looked around to make sure they were alone.\\xa0 It was probably safer than being indoors, he had to admit.\\xa0 The bat-eared experiments were on the alert, and the rain made for a lot of cover.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA win for us, as much as Westmoreland was a win for them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA win might be understating it.\\xa0 Lambert academy burned, the people that weren\\u2019t burned alive were rounded up, made to kneel, and put to the knife.\\xa0 It was symbolic, something the other revolutions could aspire toward.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Godwin grimaced.\\xa0 \\u201cBullets would have been kinder.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBullets are precious to some.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat got you thinking about Lambert?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMost burned or faced the knife, but not all.\\xa0 There have been rumors about a set of Lambert\\u2019s experiments roaming around.\\xa0 I asked Avis, and she doesn\\u2019t think they\\u2019ve been in touch with any of the other Academies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you thinking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m thinking they might not be particularly <em>attached</em> to the other Academies.\\xa0 They\\u2019re almost human, they\\u2019re functional, they can work and earn food and shelter, but I can\\u2019t imagine it\\u2019s easy for them.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not what they\\u2019re meant to do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are they?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLambert\\u2019s clean-up.\\xa0 Lambert doesn\\u2019t have enough work, so it sends them out here and there.\\xa0 They\\u2019re more about the kill than the capture.\\xa0 Four individuals.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the difficulty?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I\\u2019m wrong and I reach out, they\\u2019ll come after me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve dealt with worse, Cynthia.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a pause.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf they came after me, I\\u2019m not certain I could survive it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen play it safe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re sure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t sound convinced they could be swayed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She shook her head, shifting her umbrella to her other hand, \\u201cI\\u2019m not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was another group of stitched at the end of the block.\\xa0 They were accompanied by a creature that stood twice as tall as a man.\\xa0 Even from the other side of the street, Godwin could smell it.\\xa0 A chemical smell.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCurfew,\\u201d one stitched called out, sounding more like he was imitating the way it sounded than actually uttering the word.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia offered a little bow and flourish in response.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCurfew!\\u201d the stitched hollered the word, emphasizing the wrong syllable, raising his voice to be heard as they continued walking, the stitched falling behind them now.\\xa0 \\u201cSoon!\\xa0 Bell tolls!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Too dumb to realize she had been acknowledging it.</p>\\n<p>He felt uncomfortable and unhappy, the words ringing in his ears.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI long for simpler times,\\u201d he said, abstractly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not quite that old,\\u201d Cynthia said, patting his arm.\\xa0 \\u201cThere were stitched when you were born.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot so many.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve watched it all unfold.\\xa0 The rate of growth has been startling.\\xa0 I worry sometimes that you and the others don\\u2019t understand just what you\\u2019re facing.\\xa0 The cost, if we don\\u2019t get ahead of this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe value your pessimism,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>He smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s saved us once or twice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe all have reasons for doing this,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cGreater ones and personal ones.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have your personal reasons,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do?\\u201d she made it a question.\\xa0 Not because she wasn\\u2019t sure, but because she was wondering why he\\u2019d brought it up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWill that be a problem, if your search proves successful?\\xa0 Will you be able to understand someone with greater ones?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe woman that provoked the war?\\xa0 We\\u2019ll have to see,\\u201d Cynthia said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI worry,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf this was her first move, what is the next one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd will we be caught up in it?\\xa0 I\\u2019ll look for her, Godwin.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He smiled.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d reached his building, which was large but a touch ramshackle, in a less than stellar neighborhood.\\xa0 The important thing was that it was unassuming.\\xa0 Cynthia waited and watched, her pets standing there, heads slowly turning left and right, ears up and out, listening to every raindrop.</p>\\n<p>He opened the door, and stepped inside.\\xa0 Experiments stood on either side of the doorway.\\xa0 Cynthia\\u2019s, again.\\xa0 Sentries, knights clad in armor that grew like a bug\\u2019s exoskeleton.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t like it, but some things were necessary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll see you in the morning,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia smiled and waved, leaving, her pets following behind.</p>\\n<p>To all appearances, a coquette.\\xa0 Louis was a soldier\\u2019s son, the man had moved on to active military service, lying about his age to get in sooner.\\xa0 Cynthia was different, almost the opposite.\\xa0 She had had no family, no guidance, and she had raised herself on ugly streets overseas, where gutters had literally run red with blood, and where experiments had been piled so carelessly on trash heaps beneath the Academies that they overflowed into the city, some still alive, others dangerous despite being dead.</p>\\n<p>All she had needed was a little refining.</p>\\n<p>He walked through the house, casually moving past the myriad traps that he and Cynthia had placed.\\xa0 He was here so rarely, the minor inconvenience hardly mattered.\\xa0 More sentries were stationed throughout the house, many shuffling faintly as they sensed the activity and exited their hibernation states.</p>\\n<p>He walked into the washroom and stared at himself in the mirror.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia knew him better than anyone else, she knew how he thought.\\xa0 The inverse was also true \\u2013 he knew Cynthia better than anyone else.\\xa0 Yet he hadn\\u2019t spoken up and said the truth.</p>\\n<p>The war would get far worse before it got better.\\xa0 The Academy was retaking control, but the rebellions were still underway, and the Academy\\u2019s efforts weren\\u2019t quelling so much as they were holding things at bay.</p>\\n<p>Sooner or later, things would reach a tipping point.\\xa0 To retake control, the Academy would need to do something significant.\\xa0 Institutions of this scale had only so many ways they could achieve that kind of control.</p>\\n<p>Fear was one, and he didn\\u2019t want to think about what the Academy might do to generate such a widespread fear.</p>\\n<p>The only way forward would be to beat them to the punch.</p>\\n<p>To do something <em>horrific</em>.</p>\\n<p>For that, he needed the woman who had started the war.\\xa0 He needed those talents, and he needed to be absolutely sure that she wasn\\u2019t already doing the exact same thing.\\xa0 Because if his group and her group both acted at the same time\\u2026</p>\\n<p>He couldn\\u2019t let that happen.</p>\\n<p>He bent down to wash his face, scrubbing, feeling <em>old</em> for the first time in a long time.</p>\\n<p>When he stood straight, he had company.</p>\\n<p>The man\\u2019s skin had been flayed away and reattached, overlapping strips, like the weave of a basket, head to toe, leaving every feature masked, but for a space for a toothless, tongueless mouth and two milky white eyes.\\xa0 The flesh around the edges of each strip of skin was scarred and flaky.</p>\\n<p>A mummy, wrapped in his own flesh, almost a straightjacket, but not quite.\\xa0 Two oversized hands were already reaching out.</p>\\n<p><em>Hangman</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>They found me</em>.</p>\\n<p>Godwin reached for his razor.\\xa0 He was jerked back before he had it, his finger running along the length of the handle.</p>\\n<p>Long fingers of two hands wrapped around his neck, one after the other.\\xa0 As the fingers fell neatly into place, interlacing, his neck was elongated, vertebrae popping.\\xa0 His fingers scrabbled for purchase on the sink, his legs kicked, but it was to no avail.</p>\\n<p>Another pop, a flash of pain filling his lower body, and then it all fell to pieces.\\xa0 The nervous impulses ran away from him, signaling motions he wasn\\u2019t making, pain and sensations he shouldn\\u2019t be feeling, all with a pressure that suggested his entire body had been crushed beneath a one-ton stone.</p>\\n<p>In the mirror, his arms and legs dropped, limp.\\xa0 He huffed out a breath and didn\\u2019t take another one.</p>\\n<p>The Hangman had dislocated his neck.\\xa0 He was lowered almost dismissively to the ground, as if forgotten, as the Hangman dropped one hand to its side and then let go, letting him fall to the floor, his head cracking against the tile.</p>\\n<p>He had a view, albeit one that had darkness swiftly flowing in from the edges, of the Hangman leaving much the way it had come in.\\xa0 It touched the door and hauled itself up to the top of the doorframe, as if it weighed no more than an equivalent amount of loose paper.\\xa0 It reached the ceiling, fingers bracing it against the walls on either side of the hallway, and then it was gone, whispering against the ceiling, past the sentries and defenses.</p>\\n<p>Godwin\\u2019s last thoughts were of Cynthia, his last sentiment a quiet horror at the idea that Cynthia might well think along the same lines he had\\u2026 without the consideration to what disasters Genevieve Fray might have planned.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The hall had an upper stage that overlooked the lower floor, and Cynthia stood astride it, arms on the railing, watching.\\xa0 Her pets flanked her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>From the bottom to the top</em>, she thought.\\xa0 She was with the upper class.\\xa0 The <em>true</em> upper class, she might say.\\xa0 These weren\\u2019t nobles, but businessmen, clergy, and pillars of the community.\\xa0 They were people with money who had <em>earned</em> that money, by and large.\\xa0 Those who had been born to money were already beholden to the Academy, hooks long set in.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Men and women in fine dress.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Potential allies.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">If they were going to retake Westmore, these were allies they would need.\\xa0 It meant the difference between the Academy having a gun for every soldier or having to do without.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">One of her pets reacted, bat-ears twitching as it made a small sound.\\xa0 She wheeled around.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Nervous, since Godwin\\u2019s death.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Four individuals.\\xa0 Three men and a woman, standing in the shadows.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She almost regretted hiring them.\\xa0 The mercenaries.\\xa0 They\\u2019d turned out to be on her side, but they were\\u2026 unpleasant, both in methodology and in personality.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI thought I was alone up here,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The one in the lead shook his head.\\xa0 He had bug eyes and a custom gun slung over one shoulder.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Choleric</em>, she reminded herself.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGeneral Ames just arrived,\\u201d Melancholy said.\\xa0 Long hair covered her eyes, and she had a too-wide mouth.\\xa0 Of the four, Melancholy was the only one that Cynthia wasn\\u2019t sure about.\\xa0 The woman\\u2019s favored murder weapon wasn\\u2019t on display.\\xa0 No knife, no gun, no vials.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Cynthia turned to look.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ames was a big man, in many senses.\\xa0 Proud, boisterous, fat, ruddy-cheeked, with blond hair.\\xa0 He was perspiring.\\xa0 More than normal.\\xa0 He was with his wife and child.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat about him?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe girl,\\u201d Melancholy said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It took a moment before Cynthia could see through the crowd.\\xa0 A young lady, beautiful, wearing an evening dress in miniature.\\xa0 A little blonde that promised to be a great beauty at some point in the future.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When Melancholy spoke again, it was in Cynthia\\u2019s ear.\\xa0 Cynthia hadn\\u2019t heard the woman approach.\\xa0 \\u201cShe doesn\\u2019t smell like she\\u2019s his.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Cynthia looked, frowning.\\xa0 The girl looked like any young lady should, bouncing with excitement at the fancy dress party.\\xa0 She was saying something, and her father was having trouble keeping up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat is she?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNot human,\\u201d Melancholy said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe smells like blood.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Cynthia nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe smells like other children,\\u201d Melancholy said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Cynthia\\u2019s eyes scanned the crowd.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t see any others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know what to do,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d Melancholy said.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia smiled.\\xa0 She knew as she turned around that the four wouldn\\u2019t be there.\\xa0 In four paces, she crossed the room to pick up her gun, slipping it through a hidden pocket of her dress.</p>\\n<p>She wasn\\u2019t excited, she wasn\\u2019t proud or arrogant.\\xa0 She knew exactly what she was up against.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d come here to fight.</p>\\n<p>This, surrounded with people she couldn\\u2019t trust, was her medium.</p>\\n<p>Every time she\\u2019d faced this kind of situation in the past, everyone else had ended up bleeding or dead.</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/05/14/cat-out-of-the-bag-2-11/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>The Shepherd touched the shoulder of one of the soldiers nearest him, then leaned close to whisper something.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t take his eyes off me.\\xa0 Nothing in his posture or body language gave anything away.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t seem affected by the warm rain that ran down his face.</p>\\n<p>He might not have given anything away, as I smiled at him, trying to bait something out of him, but the soldier quickly made the Shepherd\\u2019s intent clear.\\xa0 He strode forward, saying something I couldn\\u2019t make out over the chaos of the crowd to my right.</p>\\n<p>He pointed at Mary as he was talking.\\xa0 I was suspicious he was saying names.\\xa0 Ordering the men around him.</p>\\n<p>They started forward too, a pair.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSix in total, we already have two,\\u201d the Shepherd said, his voice carrying where the soldier\\u2019s was drowned out.</p>\\n<p><em>Capture the children.</em></p>\\n<p><em>No!</em></p>\\n<p><em>Shepherd, no!\\xa0 You were supposed to be looking at me as an equal!\\xa0 You butt!</em></p>\\n<p>Mary seemed to come to the same conclusion I did.\\xa0 I saw her look toward the crowd, with the soldiers doing what they could to keep people from falling back and retreating to the church.</p>\\n<p>She looked at me.\\xa0 I held out a hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop!\\u201d a man with a gun shouted, aiming.</p>\\n<p>Mary didn\\u2019t flinch, nor did I.\\xa0 She hopped up to the wall, I grabbed her hand to help her balance, and we went down over the other side together, me a half-step behind, so I could put myself between her and the guy with the gun.</p>\\n<p>I landed in a puddle, one hand, both knees, and the toes of both feet getting thoroughly wet in the process.\\xa0 My other hand held Mary\\u2019s.\\xa0 She\\u2019d landed in a crouch, so the short wall would provide some protection, but she\\u2019d managed to keep her skirt clean.\\xa0 Her expression was\\u2026 I liked it.\\xa0 Not perfectly <em>cold</em>.\\xa0 I thought she might be enjoying herself on some level.</p>\\n<p>More guns went off, not behind us, but from the larger part of the crowd.\\xa0 The stitched who were too close to reload used fists and butt-ends of guns to strike people down.\\xa0 It was painful to look at.\\xa0 The stitched didn\\u2019t hold back nearly enough, and they were <em>strong</em>.</p>\\n<p>I sprinted from my crouching position, running along the wall, toward the crowd.\\xa0 Mary followed.</p>\\n<p>An orange light lit up the surroundings as a fire burst to life at one corner of the crowd.\\xa0 Something explosive or <em>very</em> flammable.</p>\\n<p>Even among regular civilians, the knowledge of the rules around the stitched was common.\\xa0 In a city like Radham, there were a great many farmers who relied on stitched animals and stitched farmhands.\\xa0 Inexhaustible, strong, requiring no food or pay.\\xa0 Fire tended to rile a stitched up and set them ablaze if they hadn\\u2019t been well tended, water tended to cause partial or total paralysis, if not deeper problems, and any given stitched had psychological tics.\\xa0 The brain was cut down to the barest minimum needed to follow orders and retain information, stand up, and exchange words, and in what remained, there were often trace memories, fears, words, names, or faces that all provoked responses out of the norm.\\xa0 When some stitched were hurt, poorly maintained, or when they got sick despite their high body temperatures, they would fall back on key phrases or habits.\\xa0 Children were told to limit interactions until the owner of the stitched could tell them what to do or what not to do.</p>\\n<p>With a stitched <em>soldier</em>, the cutting was often more ruthless, the ability to converse left more limited, the range of abilities vastly reduced.\\xa0 They followed orders, they learned how to use weapons, they hurt people they were told to hurt.</p>\\n<p>In Hayle\\u2019s carriage, the night after we\\u2019d taken on the snake charmer, I\\u2019d seen how the stitched bodyguard had reacted to fire.\\xa0 A new development in the production, treatment and teaching of the stitched, I was pretty sure.</p>\\n<p>The soldiers didn\\u2019t react to the flame, though they avoided it.\\xa0 They pressed forward, almost <em>harder, </em>less cautious, more violent.\\xa0 They\\u2019d been trained against fire, made to stay on course, even if that meant doing whatever they\\u2019d been doing until there was no more fire around them.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t be sure, but I suspected this was a surprise to the Shepherd\\u2019s comrades in arms.\\xa0 What they\\u2019d learned about the stitched fighting alongside them in the war was no longer true.</p>\\n<p>Mary and I made our way into the crowd.\\xa0 The soldiers who\\u2019d been sent after us were only a few steps behind.</p>\\n<p>It was a very different dance for them and for us.\\xa0 Mary and I were moving as fast as we could, nimble, dodging between people who were alternately pressing forward and trying to run.\\xa0 I turned sideways at points, jabbed two fingers into one man\\u2019s ass crack to get him lurching forward and out of my way, ducked between one set of legs, and very nearly got knocked in the head by the end of a hoe someone was holding as a weapon.\\xa0 Mary was right behind me.</p>\\n<p>The people following us, by contrast, were pushing through.\\xa0 They had <em>presence</em>, people naturally moved out of their way, and they had the physical prowess to work past the ones who didn\\u2019t, or who moved the wrong way and ended up as obstacles anyway.</p>\\n<p>We weren\\u2019t the only ones navigating this strange battlefield of terrified and outraged civilians.\\xa0 Several stitched had made their way into the crowd.</p>\\n<p>One stitched nearby had both hands on its gun, and was swinging left and right, hitting people with elbows, the butt of the gun and the bayonet on the end.\\xa0 It had been stabbed twice, one weapon still stuck through its chest cavity, its face had been sliced open to reveal a thick wire that had been placed beneath the skin.\\xa0 The wire was insulated by a tight coiling of something or other, and where the insulation had been cut by the same weapon, the wire periodically sparked, the surrounding flesh twitching reflexively in reaction.</p>\\n<p>It had leveled ten or so people just getting this far, leaving them crumpled, bleeding and broken.\\xa0 Surrounded, it was strong enough to keep the crowd back, and scary enough that people were fleeing from it, pushing and jostling others.</p>\\n<p>Had the Shepherd expected things to go this way?\\xa0 Had he expected to <em>win</em>?\\xa0 Because the crowd wasn\\u2019t winning, and I suspected things would be much the same if Jamie had left things alone.\\xa0 His side would be doing <em>better</em>, but things would be moving toward the same end result.</p>\\n<p>An incoherent shout from the Shepherd\\u2019s camp went out.\\xa0 It was picked up by others, traveling forward through the crowd.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBurn the handlers!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Oh, well, that was one way to do it.</p>\\n<p>Stitched didn\\u2019t tend to scream unless they were broken by fire or delirium.\\xa0 Still, as the fires erupted, the eyes were treated to a sudden flare of light, illuminating everything, and the ears were treated to screams of panic and pain.</p>\\n<p>Not quite as tidy as I\\u2019d hoped.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d entered the crowd for a reason.\\xa0 I chanced a look back, and saw that the crowd had bogged down our pursuers.\\xa0 The press of bodies shifted, blocking my view of them.</p>\\n<p>Blocking their view of us.</p>\\n<p>I found Mary\\u2019s hand and tugged, changing direction.\\xa0 We weren\\u2019t the only ones who were trying to move back toward the church, away from the fire, the stitched, the bullets, and everything else, but we were the only ones who were less than five feet tall.\\xa0 That counted for something.\\xa0 It gave us a fraction more mobility.</p>\\n<p>Okay.\\xa0 This was usually the part where I fucked things up.\\xa0 Gordon was better at it than I was.\\xa0 I tended to overthink it.</p>\\n<p>Not just fighting<em>.\\xa0 Strategy</em>.\\xa0 I could plot like nobody I knew, but strategy was an entirely different game.</p>\\n<p>I tried to recall the number of soldiers that had been stationed at the back of the crowd and along the wall, compelling people forward, standing on or partially on the wall to shoot over the crowd.\\xa0 From that number and the general positions of them, there were any number of things I could do.\\xa0 The soldiers were all committed.\\xa0 Those that could be spared had been sent after us.\\xa0 That gave us options.</p>\\n<p>I cut my thoughts short at that.\\xa0 No use in complicating things, getting too far ahead of myself, and then having my plan fall to pieces when something unexpected happened.</p>\\n<p><em>Decide two things I want.</em></p>\\n<p>The first was finding Lillian and even freeing Gordon.</p>\\n<p>The second was maximizing disruption.</p>\\n<p>Okay, no, wait, I had three things I wanted.</p>\\n<p>Getting the Shepherd to see me as an equal was the third one.</p>\\n<p>There.</p>\\n<p>That was the plan.</p>\\n<p>I checked Mary was with me, double checked we weren\\u2019t followed, then pushed my way through.</p>\\n<p>Lillian wasn\\u2019t far from where we\\u2019d left her.\\xa0 The soldier who\\u2019d taken custody of her had, probably at the Shepherd\\u2019s instruction, backed away, keeping her closer to where the Shepherd, the captain of the soldiers, and the guy holding Gordon all were.</p>\\n<p>The guy that had been watching her had been relieved by someone else.</p>\\n<p>The man was holding his rifle out sideways, a barrier to discourage people from retreating.\\xa0 He was shouting, driving them forward, saying something about the Academy, something about how to deal with a stitched.</p>\\n<p>Being short was an advantage.\\xa0 I ducked under the rifle and through the gap.\\xa0 He hadn\\u2019t expected anyone to be moving quite as fast or with quite so much focus as I was, and even the ones that were had been liable to bump into his weapon.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd\\u2019s captain saw me.\\xa0 He shouted, \\u201cGrab him!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave the man an arm, practically slapping my wrist into his reaching hand.\\xa0 My other arm I held back, in Mary\\u2019s direction, hand up.</p>\\n<p><em>Stop.\\xa0 Wait.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Wait.</em></p>\\n<p>Another explosion of flame erupted at the far end of the battlefield.\\xa0 The soldier that had me looked up and over the crowd.</p>\\n<p>More importantly, most of the <em>crowd</em> looked away.</p>\\n<p>I dropped the arm.</p>\\n<p>Mary moved.\\xa0 Her skirt clung to her mud-streaked legs as she lunged forward.\\xa0 The soldier saw the incoming attack, but his weapon was still held up to hold people back, and my hands went around his wrist, holding his hand so he couldn\\u2019t move it.</p>\\n<p>Mary stepped up onto the soldier\\u2019s thigh, grabbed his shirt to help her upward momentum, and drove the top of her head into the man\\u2019s chin.\\xa0 She held onto him as he dropped, adding her weight to his.\\xa0 He tumbled, stunned, and his hand released my wrist.</p>\\n<p>The soldier nearest us turned to look, eyes going wide.</p>\\n<p>I was already bending, grabbing the rifle from the fallen man, spinning-</p>\\n<p>One or two people who\\u2019d seen the gap and were panicked by the latest explosion rushed past me, bumping me.\\xa0 My aim was off.</p>\\n<p>I still managed to scrape the back of the second soldier\\u2019s calf.\\xa0 He dropped.\\xa0 A second person pushing past me knocked the rifle out of my grip.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t bother to rescue it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRun away!\\u201d I howled, my voice raw.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t take much to tip the scales and give life to the idea that was already in people\\u2019s heads.\\xa0 What was an initial one to three people quickly turned into a stampede.</p>\\n<p>What had been a mass of people outside the short walls of the church was now draining out, feeding into the yard just past the church doors.</p>\\n<p>Mary was <em>smiling</em> as she joined me, mingling in with the rush of bodies.</p>\\n<p>Disruption managed.\\xa0 Now for the rescue of Lillian.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd gave a command.\\xa0 The men that had been holding back the crowd and the captain all converged on us, pushing past the bodies.</p>\\n<p>Had to do this right.</p>\\n<p>Like a professional.\\xa0 Tidy, like Hayle wanted.</p>\\n<p>Well, insofar as any of this was <em>tidy</em>.\\xa0 I could make the argument that some of this was inevitable.\\xa0 The trick was leading this to as tidy a conclusion as possible.\\xa0 Given a sequence of things to focus on, people liked to focus on the beginning and the end.</p>\\n<p>Our beginning had been good.\\xa0 We\\u2019d identified the threat.</p>\\n<p>Our end\\u2026 well, we had to neutralize it.</p>\\n<p>My eye fixed on the man who held Lillian.\\xa0 He had his gun, and he had her collar in a deathgrip that pulled it up and tight to her neck.\\xa0 Her bag was on the ground to one side.</p>\\n<p><em>Tidy</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>Properly</em>.</p>\\n<p>I rushed the man.\\xa0 Mary had done the headbutt to one vulnerable area.\\xa0 I aimed for one that was closer to the ground.\\xa0 Between the man\\u2019s legs.</p>\\n<p>For my trouble, I got a knee in the chest.\\xa0 He struck me in the head with the butt end of his gun.\\xa0 I fell.</p>\\n<p>Mary was a step behind me.\\xa0 She grabbed the wrist of his gun hand with both hands, and with this happening so quickly after he\\u2019d clubbed me with the thing, he took a second before reasserting his strength, holding the weapon firm.</p>\\n<p>Mary drove her shoulder\\xa0 into the side of the weapon.\\xa0 The bayonet blade slammed into the man\\u2019s forehead.</p>\\n<p>She did it again.\\xa0 A second gash in the brow.\\xa0 He let go of Lillian to grab the weapon with another hand.</p>\\n<p>Mary stepped past the defense to slice him with a knife.\\xa0 Quick slashes, inner thighs.\\xa0 She ducked as he slammed the side of the rifle toward her face, then stabbed him twice in the belly.</p>\\n<p>He staggered, almost tripping over me, but Mary grabbed him by the sleeve and belt, hauling on him with all of her weight.</p>\\n<p>I rolled in the opposite direction, rising to my feet so quickly that I nearly fell over again with the sideways momentum.\\xa0 Mary let him fall, reaching out to block the bayonet he swung at her on his way down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian!\\u201d I said, loud enough to be heard over the crowd.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I swept up the bag, pushing her as we started moving again.\\xa0 Mary was already in step, not needing further cues.</p>\\n<p>As a trio, we continued toward the church.\\xa0 The men coming after us were closing in, only a few steps away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust the girl I was looking for,\\u201d I said, as we ran.\\xa0 \\u201cI need you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled wider than I\\u2019d seen in some time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cScalpels,\\u201d I told her, shoving the bag at her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm,\\u201d she said, she reached in.\\xa0 She handed me a scalpel with a cover over the end.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGunk!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGunk?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGunk!\\u201d I said, louder.</p>\\n<p>She gave me a squat container with a screw-off lid.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGreat!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNow go, get lost!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The smile dropped off her face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHide, I mean!\\u201d I shouted.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t thinking straight, trying to think along multiple tracks at once.\\xa0 \\u201cMary, go with her!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>They carried forward, heading toward the church.</p>\\n<p>I stopped, twisting, and turned around.</p>\\n<p>There were about five civilians rushing my way.\\xa0 Between them were three soldiers, one of whom was the Shepherd\\u2019s captain buddy, about as different from the Shepherd as a man could be.\\xa0 Tan skinned, short dark hair, a weather-worn face, all browns and darkness and leatheriness.</p>\\n<p>A clean, tidy finish.\\xa0 My disposal of the last guy hadn\\u2019t been very successful, but this <em>had</em> to succeed.</p>\\n<p>The soldiers were blocking the gaps between civilians.\\xa0 The civilians were running with a mindlessness that suggested they\\u2019d run straight over me if I got in their way.\\xa0 It was a wall of people twice or thrice my size charging at me.</p>\\n<p>I picked up speed.\\xa0 My legs were sore from a more-than-usual amount of running, but I gave my all, gave my <em>last</em> to charge forward, straight for the nearest civilian.</p>\\n<p>Toward the Shepherd, toward Lacey.</p>\\n<p>To Gordon.</p>\\n<p>Just when it looked like the guy was going to run into me, I ducked.\\xa0 I slid on wet grass.\\xa0 The man half-jumped, half stumbled over me.</p>\\n<p>I found my feet, but just as I\\u2019d slid on grass, the soles of my shoes did too.\\xa0 I\\u2019d meant to dart forward.\\xa0 Instead, I stumbled a little.</p>\\n<p>If I\\u2019d been an inch further ahead, I might have avoided the reaching hands.\\xa0 Instead, one caught me.\\xa0 I twisted to avoid the other.\\xa0 Twisted again to make the wet cloth of my cloak twist until the man\\u2019s grip on it broke.</p>\\n<p>I made it another couple of steps.\\xa0 But just as I\\u2019d reoriented myself, so had my pursuers.\\xa0 The captain seized me.\\xa0 Firmly this time.</p>\\n<p>I hurled the container.\\xa0 I hurled the scalpel.</p>\\n<p>They landed in arm\\u2019s reach of Gordon, who had also been caught.</p>\\n<p>He stared down at both.</p>\\n<p>He met my gaze.</p>\\n<p>One deep breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop fighting!\\u201d Gordon howled the words.\\xa0 \\u201cEveryone, stop fighting!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He had a <em>great </em>lung capacity.\\xa0 Then again, he had a great <em>everything</em>.\\xa0 Powerful vocal chords.</p>\\n<p>Heads turned.\\xa0 He had attention.</p>\\n<p>The soldier grabbed him, tried to shut him up.\\xa0 Gordon leveraged all the strength he\\u2019d held back up until now, bullying his way free.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop fighting!\\xa0 Please!\\u201d he screamed.</p>\\n<p>He had the attention of most of the crowd, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRelax,\\u201d the Shepherd called out.\\xa0 \\u201cCalm down!\\xa0 There\\u2019s nothing to worry about.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>He</em>,\\u201d Gordon pointed at the Shepherd, \\u201cHe did this to me!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>His hand went to his face, touched the deep cuts the \\u2018monster\\u2019 had supposedly inflicted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe cut me so he could <em>scare</em> you!\\xa0 The monsters are made up!\\u201d\\xa0 Gordon cried out.</p>\\n<p>The silence was so real it could have been cut with a knife.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s crazy!\\xa0 He did this!\\u201d\\xa0 Gordon cried out.\\xa0 He scrambled forward, away from the soldier who\\u2019d been holding him. grabbing the scalpel and jar.\\xa0 \\u201cLook at this, taste the slime!\\xa0 It\\u2019s <em>soap</em>!\\xa0 My teacher didn\\u2019t do anything at all!\\xa0 He blamed her to take attention off him!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The soldiers who\\u2019d been after me headed toward Gordon now.</p>\\n<p>The captain turned, too, but I grabbed onto him, fought him every step of the way.</p>\\n<p>He hit me.\\xa0 Not a big blow, but a heavy enough one to knock me free.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s\\u2026 he\\u2019s not right in the head!\\u201d Gordon cried out.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease!\\xa0 Don\\u2019t listen to him!\\xa0 He wanted this!\\xa0 All of it!\\xa0 Before it all started he called us into his office and told us what we were supposed to do, and threatened us.\\xa0 The man who read out the names!\\xa0 He was working with Reverend Mauer too!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Poor Cecil.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe boy is deluded,\\u201d the Shepherd spoke, and his voice carried.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s easier to imagine a monster here than to recognize the monsters that the Academy created.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The stitched that had been plowing through the crowd were on the approach now.\\xa0 The crowd backed away, and wound up moving toward the Shepherd.</p>\\n<p>A woman reached Gordon, taking his less bloody hand.\\xa0 She bent down and, after a dubious look, touched her mouth to his knuckle.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSoap,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSoap,\\u201d Gordon echoed her, pushing the things into her hands.\\xa0 \\u201cSoap and a knife.\\xa0 Please don\\u2019t let Reverend Mauer hurt me anymore.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He turned toward the Shepherd, giving the man a wounded, accusatory look.</p>\\n<p>She embraced him, arms around his shoulders, wrists crossing over his collarbone.</p>\\n<p>Outraged shouts rose from the crowd.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd was still, taking it all in, looking at his crowd.</p>\\n<p><em>Do you have any magic words, Shepherd?</em>\\xa0 I thought.</p>\\n<p>He looked at me.</p>\\n<p><em>Goal three completed.</em></p>\\n<p>He let the look linger, then broke away, staring over at the row of stitched and the one or two handlers that were still pressing in.\\xa0 Only one or two stitched had properly <em>died</em> in this assault.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd gave a hand signal.</p>\\n<p>The captain blew his horn.\\xa0 Two sharp blows.</p>\\n<p>With that, the soldiers turned.</p>\\n<p>The retreat was planned.\\xa0 The direction was already known.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d <em>known</em> they would lose this fight, I realized.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d planned it, even.\\xa0 The retreat was part of it all.</p>\\n<p>Did they have a waiting vehicle?</p>\\n<p>The soldiers, including the captain and the ones who\\u2019d been after me and Mary, raised their weapons, warding off the handful of people who looked like they were going to start rioting against the <em>Shepherd</em>.\\xa0 They retreated as fast as they were able.\\xa0 People were caught between avoiding the stitched and the threat of the guns.</p>\\n<p>They stopped, going still.\\xa0 They dropped to their knees and raised hands.\\xa0 The wall of stitched came to a halt.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd started to make his retreat.\\xa0 He turned to look, and in that instant, Helen appeared, emerging from the shrubbery in front of the church.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been within a few paces of him for the better part of the skirmish.</p>\\n<p>Striding forward, right through a collective blind spot.\\xa0 The soldiers and Shepherd were all focused on the crowd behind.</p>\\n<p>She threw her arms around the Shepherd\\u2019s waist.</p>\\n<p>He stumbled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet go,\\u201d I could hear him from a distance.</p>\\n<p>She held firm, face pressed against his side.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet go!\\u201d he raised his voice.</p>\\n<p>He tugged at her arm.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t release him.</p>\\n<p>The stitched were drawing closer.\\xa0 The crowd was staring.</p>\\n<p>He pushed her, so that she no longer had her feet under her, then tugged again.</p>\\n<p><em>Nice, Helen</em>.</p>\\n<p>She held firm, a six and a half stone weight, tying him down.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd reached into his coat and withdrew a pistol.\\xa0 He pressed it to the girl\\u2019s head.</p>\\n<p>I could hear a collective intake of breath from the crowd.</p>\\n<p>He was done.\\xa0 He would never again have the people of Radham.</p>\\n<p>She looked up, staring him in the eyes.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t let go.</p>\\n<p>I felt a chill.\\xa0 A premonition.</p>\\n<p>Prey instinct at work?\\xa0 Putting together all the little context clues, the hints in his body language, demeanor, the clues he\\u2019d given me all night, adding up to my estimation of who he was?</p>\\n<p>He was going to shoot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen!\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>She glanced over her shoulder.\\xa0 The look she gave me was cold.\\xa0 Probably the same look she\\u2019d given the man.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet him go,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She did, without a moment\\u2019s hesitation.</p>\\n<p>The man backed away, holding the pistol up and out.</p>\\n<p>The captain caught up with him, clapping a hand on his shoulder.\\xa0 The two of them turned, marching forward.\\xa0 The soldiers were just behind, weapons pointed at the mob.</p>\\n<p>I walked up to Lacey.\\xa0 She looked hollowed-out.\\xa0 Haunted.\\xa0 It was almost scary to see.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d asked too much of her tonight.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>The shocked look on her face looked more dramatic than any emotion she\\u2019d shown us while being taken hostage or accused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d I said again, to drive the point home.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry to ask for more, but\\u2026 the Academy needs to win over the crowd.\\xa0 Get the permission slip from Gordon.\\xa0 Take it to one of the Academy people on the other side.\\xa0 Tell them to blame things on the Shepherd.\\xa0 Someone says they knew he was bad, he was manipulating people, drugging them, let\\u2019s say.\\xa0 Take the blame away from people, just-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can call me Sy,\\u201d I offered, as a conciliatory measure.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester\\u2026 shut up, please.\\xa0 I understand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey need to offer medical attention.\\xa0 They have to be kind.\\xa0 The stitched need to go, fast.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 She stood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSend Gordon into the church, when he\\u2019s given you the thing,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cGet Jamie, send him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe church?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cGotta go after the Shepherd, if we can.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She frowned.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t press any further.\\xa0 I looked at Helen and beckoned her.\\xa0 I found Gordon, saw him looking at me, and pointed at Lacey.</p>\\n<p>Then I ran to the church.\\xa0 Mary and Lillian stepped out of cover by the altar.</p>\\n<p>It took only two minutes to regroup.\\xa0 Lillian daubed powder on Helen\\u2019s injuries, then Gordon\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>When Jamie arrived, I pointed at the side door.\\xa0 The side door in the Shepherd\\u2019s office.</p>\\n<p>As a group, we headed through the side door, then broke into a run as we headed in the direction the Shepherd had gone.</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t moving at a fast pace.\\xa0 He couldn\\u2019t, given his arm, the balance and the weight of it.\\xa0 He\\u2019d made a good distance, but we did too, even with our shorter legs.</p>\\n<p>He had a gun in one hand, but something glinted in his mouth as he turned his head.\\xa0 His cheeks puffed.</p>\\n<p>He turned further, and we collectively ducked into cover of shadow.</p>\\n<p>More soldiers were joining him.\\xa0 The flanking groups, the ones who\\u2019d firebombed the stitched.\\xa0 Others, maybe scouting parties.</p>\\n<p>A small army, and there he was in the center of it, with the captain and a shorter man.</p>\\n<p>He puffed his cheeks again.</p>\\n<p>A large shape moved.</p>\\n<p>It looked like a headless cat, the neck inflated in size, or a lion with a massive mane, the head removed, all drawn out in spines that were too white to seem real.\\xa0 Easily the size of an automobile, a bit larger.</p>\\n<p>It prowled on a rooftop, hopped down, and paced around the perimeter of the group.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd said something, the group parted, and the Shepherd blew again on his tiny, silent whistle.</p>\\n<p>The thing, Whiskers, approached.\\xa0 It got close enough that the Shepherd could reach out with his meaty, mutated hand, and touch it.\\xa0 He dropped his hand, the fingers bleeding from the tips.</p>\\n<p>The group moved, and Whiskers retreated as quickly as it had come, darting onto the top of a shed, then a garage.</p>\\n<p>The Shepherd periodically blew, to keep it close enough, a constant retreat from Whiskers and a compelling call from the Shepherd.</p>\\n<p>I moved to follow.\\xa0 Gordon reached out to stop me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have to,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s good enough as is,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut he- I want to catch him,\\u201d I said, watching the man\\u2019s back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe won\\u2019t.\\xa0 Not with that many people guarding him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want it as much as I\\u2019ve wanted anything,\\u201d I admitted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m bleeding, Helen\\u2019s bleeding, you\\u2019re bruised.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s call it a night, report to Hayle so he can send some other projects after them, then go home.\\xa0 There\\u2019ll be another try.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I made a whiny sound, deep in my throat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s hurry, see if we can\\u2019t get Mary settled.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was a good thing to say to change my focus.\\xa0 I allowed myself a nod.</p>\\n<p>We headed toward the Academy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood work,\\u201d I said, to nobody in particular.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas fun!\\u201d Mary said, suddenly lively.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt really was,\\u201d I said, quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGlad it was fun for <em>you</em>,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cHuh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was awful.\\xa0 Hated it, the acting, the playing the lame duck, trying to sway the crowd, doing <em>nothing</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We walked a few more steps.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hate you so much,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/05/16/enemy-arc-2/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou should really put your hood up,\\u201d Jamie told me, as we got out of the coach.\\xa0 Lacey and Cecil were just behind us.\\xa0 We\\u2019d been picked up on our way back.</p>\\n<p>I frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know Rick got on your case about it earlier, but it\\u2019s cold out.\\xa0 I worry about you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I get sick, the Academy will make me better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie pointed at the Hedge, which we were just now approaching.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd if you have to come here or somewhere to get a few shots, then they\\u2019ll keep you and set you up for an <em>appointment</em>, just like they did when you burned yourself with flesh-dissolving spittle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTechnically, the Snake Charmer burned me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know why you insist on correcting me on the details,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI <em>know</em> the details.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t forget the details.\\xa0 I have the details in writing, even.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do it to annoy you when you\\u2019re being annoying.\\xa0 Quid pro quo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not what quid- you\\u2019re doing it again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I grinned.</p>\\n<p>He was too tired to hit me, so I threw an arm around his shoulder instead.</p>\\n<p>We stopped as a group in front of the four guards by the Hedge\\u2019s doors.\\xa0 We remained silent as Lacey and Cecil approached the guards.\\xa0 Lacey handed over the paper that Briggs had given us.</p>\\n<p>A moment later, the doors were open, the paper returned to us, and we were free to enter the Academy\\u2019s most public area.\\xa0 A hospital for the people of Radham.\\xa0 The Hedge was, perhaps for the first time in a year or two, staffed by a skeleton crew.\\xa0 Empty benches filled the lobby, with a student sleeping on one, a book left open across his chest, a few doctors in gray coats stood by with some students in their white lab coats, attending to papers and doing what they could to get organized.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTravis,\\u201d Cecil greeted one.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCecil.\\xa0 You came in through the front door?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThings are mostly resolved, I think.\\xa0 Wouldn\\u2019t be surprised if those doors open soon, with word from the higher-ups.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The doctor Cecil was talking to, an older man, looked fairly annoyed by that.\\xa0 \\u201cI was hoping this would go on for a bit longer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPeople were dying and getting hurt,\\u201d Jamie said, quiet.</p>\\n<p>Doctor Travis blinked.\\xa0 \\u201cGood to know.\\xa0 Becca, would you go wake up some of the other doctors?\\xa0 With the backlog and these injured parties coming in, we\\u2019ll be busy tonight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cActually,\\u201d Cecil said.\\xa0 He took the slip of paper from Lacey, then showed it to Travis.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to talk to Professor Briggs first.\\xa0 As soon as possible.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Travis frowned, looking at the note.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy do you have this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t say.\\xa0 I do need it back, though.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNick, then,\\u201d Doctor Travis said, returning the paper.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re a fast runner.\\xa0 Go find Professor Briggs.\\xa0 On your way back, wake up the other Hedge Doctors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A young man that wasn\\u2019t much older than eighteen sprinted from the room.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t what I meant,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout people dying and getting hurt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know what you meant, son.\\xa0 It might seem callous, but the work comes first, feelings second.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like to think they mingle,\\u201d Cecil said.</p>\\n<p><em>You\\u2019re a prat</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey can,\\u201d Doctor Travis allowed.\\xa0 \\u201cBut when you work in the Hedge, you can\\u2019t tie your emotions to every piece of work that comes through those doors.\\xa0 Half the time they\\u2019re mostly gone by the time they make it here.\\xa0 When you know you could save everyone, but the money and resources aren\\u2019t so plentiful, and you have to make choices.\\xa0 Even when it\\u2019s a child, or someone\\u2019s mother.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s a good reason I don\\u2019t work in the Hedge,\\u201d Cecil said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo those children behind you need some attention?\\u201d Travis asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s why we\\u2019re here,\\u201d Cecil said.</p>\\n<p>He was talking about Gordon and Helen, who were cut up, though they\\u2019d received preliminary treatment in the coach with Lillian, Lacey and Cecil tending to them.\\xa0 I was bruised, scraped, and filthy, while Mary had scuffed up hands, though I wasn\\u2019t sure the Doctor could see that.</p>\\n<p>We were taken to benches, where we put our feet on the seats and sat on the backs, the doctors and students looking after us.</p>\\n<p>The student who was looking after me informed me that, \\u201cThis bruise will turn a very <em>fun</em> orange color later tonight.\\xa0 It will be gone by the morning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFun?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it interesting?\\u201d he asked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t be a dick, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I shut my mouth, frowning.</p>\\n<p>The student wheeled over a cart, where a dozen implements were laid out on top, wires with insulation coils running down to the covered box on the cart\\u2019s lower half.\\xa0 He picked up a woodpecker,screwed on three vials, each with a stylish, flourishing letter printed on it, the contents colored for further clarity, then flicked a switch to start the needle to its back and forth motion.</p>\\n<p>Urgh.\\xa0 I hated needles.\\xa0 Even motorized ones.</p>\\n<p>My mind started running through scenarios, much as it had at several points earlier in the night.\\xa0 Possibilities, where things were, where <em>people</em> were, tracking details, <em>plotting</em>.</p>\\n<p>Jamie\\u2019s hand settled on mine.</p>\\n<p>I let the train of thoughts unspool, each idea running off course until they collectively dissolved into a general air of negativity and resentment.\\xa0 I flinched as the woodpecker started stabbing me, then grit my teeth.\\xa0 There was a painkiller in there, making the pain of the needle\\u2019s stab a fleeting one.\\xa0 He covered what would have been the full breadth of the bruising thus far.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI take it this is your stitching work, Cecil?\\u201d Travis asked.\\xa0 He was removing the stitches in Gordon\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is.\\xa0 Miss Lacey did most of the work on Helen over there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The female doctor who was working with Helen commented, \\u201cWho did the collarbone and upper chest?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did,\\u201d Lillian said, quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReally?\\xa0 Well applied binding emulsion with minimal stitching.\\xa0 Applied outside of a hospital environment?\\xa0 Mix?\\xa0 Antibacterial base, I imagine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo need,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>We weren\\u2019t so clumsy to actually turn our heads and give her shocked looks, but I could sense the reaction from the others.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s hand tightened up a bit where it was holding mine down against the top of the bench.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe was already on a regimen,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cP base, A, D, E mixes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmm.\\xa0 Overall, very nearly perfect.\\xa0 The kind of work I\\u2019d expect from a year ten student.\\xa0 A year twelve might not do this kind of work out in the rain,\\u201d the doctor said.\\xa0 Travis looked over to investigate and murmured approvingly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were in a coach, and I\\u2019ve focused a lot on field care,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She kept her expression placid, tone modest, but I could tell from the agitation of her hands and the slight kicking movement of her feet that she was inordinately pleased at the praise.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNonetheless,\\u201d Travis said, turning his attention back to Gordon.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat are your plans for the future, honey?\\xa0 I\\u2019d like to steal you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAhem,\\u201d the female doctor said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019d steal you,\\u201d Travis amended his statement.\\xa0 \\u201cFor the Hedge?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm.\\xa0 I may have other obligations,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Travis made an annoyed \\u2018tsk\\u2019 sound.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho?\\u201d the female doctor asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProfessor Hayle is sponsoring me,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>The silence was telling.\\xa0 Had she given another name, the response might have been a \\u2018Good choice, good choice\\u2019 or\\xa0 a \\u2018Promising!\\u2019, but Hayle\\u2019s department was seen as a doomed one.</p>\\n<p>The woodpecker stopped, and I felt muscles relax where I hadn\\u2019t even known they were tense.\\xa0 I raised a hand toward my forehead, and the student slapped it away.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t touch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He turned his back to wheel the cart away, and I raised my hand toward my forehead again.</p>\\n<p>Jamie slapped it away this time.</p>\\n<p>My student returned, and turned his focus to Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you need care?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie shook his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have a mark on your collarbone.\\xa0 It looks like it goes lower.\\xa0 If you\\u2019d take off your shirt, I can look after that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie shook his head again, with more force than before.\\xa0 He fixed his shirt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you sure?\\xa0 I won\\u2019t hurt, I can apply-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, thank you.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s fine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The student gave me a curious look, but didn\\u2019t say anything further.</p>\\n<p>Jamie gave my hand a pat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you?\\u201d the student asked Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy hands are a little scraped up.\\xa0 I\\u2019d rather Lillian look after them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, your friend?\\xa0 I imagine you would,\\u201d the student said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary gave an awkward smile back.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t take long for Briggs to arrive.\\xa0 He came in the company of a stitched and a young female doctor.\\xa0 The stitched carried an oversize umbrella and a set of files, while the young doctor had three birds on her arm, each one hooded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLeave us,\\u201d Professor Briggs said.</p>\\n<p>The doctors and students left the room as quickly as they could without actually running.\\xa0 Equipment was left behind.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou too, Cecil,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe young lady can stay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Cecil frowned, but he made his exit, following Doctor Travis.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExplain,\\u201d Briggs said, which was probably the least positive way he could have asked.</p>\\n<p>Gordon spoke up.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t stitched up anymore, but had wet streaks over the cuts that were now virtually invisible, they\\u2019d been pressed together so neatly.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s running, and he has Whiskers-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhiskers?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm.\\xa0 The first escaped project.\\xa0 We didn\\u2019t know that it was possible to control it.\\xa0 We would have given chase if we hadn\\u2019t been surprised.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWally, the guy we interrogated, he left out the critical detail, sir,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you need a test subject for parasites, look no further than him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Briggs nodded.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t look happy, thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMauer went due east from the church,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe has thirty soldiers that we saw-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThirty seven,\\u201d Jamie corrected, quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThirty seven,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf the other projects aren\\u2019t in that area, they\\u2019re wasting their time.\\xa0 If you direct them after him, they could get both Mauer and Whiskers.\\xa0 Or they could get killed, depending.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Briggs reached into a voluminous coat pocket to retrieve a notepad no longer or wider across than his hand.\\xa0 He picked a pen out of the pocket on the other side, then scribbled out a note, tearing it off and handing it to the girl with the birds.</p>\\n<p>He kept writing as he spoke.\\xa0 \\u201cSoldiers?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon continued, \\u201cMauer was an ex-soldier.\\xa0 He kept in touch with old colleagues.\\xa0 Years of resentment adding up to a loathing of the Academy.\\xa0 He wanted the Academy to attack so that he\\u2019d have ammunition to use in future efforts.\\xa0 This was a long-term plan, working against the Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I added, \\u201cSir, he has or <em>had</em> moles inside the Academy walls to sabotage us, he was actively working to turn the public against us, probably to cut off supplies and make life as hard as possible, and he had soldiers with knowledge of the Academy and its methods to disable our best efforts.\\xa0 I think he wanted to play the long game.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo what ends?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cDemanding concessions, getting into a position of power where he could hit the Academy where it hurt and walk away untouched?\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry, sir, but we can\\u2019t say for sure until we catch him and get him in an interrogation room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was alerted to the fact that the riot did start, despite your efforts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, sir,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt started because of our efforts.\\xa0 We set things in motion in a controlled way, with the idea that we could turn the tables on Mauer.\\xa0 We did.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s neutered,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s a villain to the people, now, sir,\\u201d I clarified.\\xa0 \\u201cSomeone who cuts children, lies, makes up stories about escaped experiments, tries to make innocent women into scapegoats, and puts a gun to the head of a wounded little girl.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat last one was me,\\u201d Helen said, wiggling a bit in her seat, smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe anger over what happened tonight should mostly be directed at Mauer, not at us,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cShort of getting him and getting all the answers, it\\u2019s the best resolution we could hope for.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Briggs nodded.\\xa0 He finished writing the third piece of paper, then worked with the young doctor with the birds.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I craned my head as the girl with the birds headed out the door.\\xa0 \\u201cAre those messenger birds?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe birds are modified to be able to smell the other projects.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll find them and deliver the messages, provided they\\u2019re in or near the city,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s no good way to communicate with them in the field, this was the means we devised.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs- do <em>we</em> have a bird, sir?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Briggs said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan we, sir?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said, in a tone that made it sound less like he was going to kill me and more like Gordon killing me was an <em>inevitability.\\xa0 </em>\\u201c<em>No</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I slouched a bit, then leaned forward, elbows resting on my knees.\\xa0 I was still sitting on the back of the bench, Jamie standing behind me, Mary a short distance to the side, silent and nearly invisible.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLacey, was it?\\u201d Briggs asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can confirm all of this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt seems accurate, based on what I witnessed.\\xa0 I should note that Cecil was accused of being in league with Mauer.\\xa0 Measures should be taken to keep him out of the public eye for a time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s something we can do.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sure he\\u2019ll be content to be in his new laboratory.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He seemed to consider a moment.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d Briggs finally said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Lambs project will get those badges that were asked for, if it means they can keep up this degree of work.\\xa0 I was told they could resolve this better than we might have if I\\u2019d sent a regiment of stitched to quell the riot, and the Lambs followed through.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Lacey said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHayle can have the budget increase and additional staffing I know he intended to ask for.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve also signed off on the requests.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Briggs took the file folders from the stitched beside him, shuffled through them to find one specific one, and then handed it to Lacey.</p>\\n<p><em>Sounds too good to be true</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs there a catch, sir?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCatch?\\xa0 In a way, yes.\\xa0 Professor Hayle has been going on at length about your collective merits.\\xa0 My own methodology when building something is to test it until it breaks.\\xa0 Then I repair or start it anew.\\xa0 I repeat this process until it cannot break.\\xa0 The superweapon that sleeps under our feet is evidence that this can work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were some nods from us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI will be making more use of you, in coming weeks and months.\\xa0 I will be <em>testing</em> you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Until we break.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd,\\u201d he said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want it said that you broke because I didn\\u2019t give you or Hayle the necessary resources.\\xa0 Change is afoot, a firm hand will be needed to keep things steady.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>More nods.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo.\\xa0 Miss Lacey, if you could deliver that to Professor Hayle?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can.\\u201d she replied.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you for your hard work.\\xa0 The Lambs can go home.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t expect they\\u2019ll be much use against a squadron of ex-soldiers and an experiment on a leash.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMauer is the most dangerous of them,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cUm, sir, sorry.\\xa0 He\\u2019s brilliant, he\\u2019s good at manipulating people on a large scale.\\xa0 You really shouldn\\u2019t underestimate him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Briggs\\u2019 expression didn\\u2019t change.\\xa0 He really liked his long pauses.\\xa0 He had the clout to make others entertain them.\\xa0 He finally said, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll deal with him to the best of our ability.\\xa0 Your part in this is done, however.\\xa0 You should rest.\\xa0 Tend to your wounds.\\xa0 I may call on you as soon as tomorrow morning.\\xa0 I have things to look after.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Tomorrow morning.</p>\\n<p>His bird-woman crossed the room to his side, joining Briggs and the stitched.\\xa0 The three of them headed for the other side of the Hedge, where it exited into the Academy grounds, inside the walls.</p>\\n<p>Lacey looked us over.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou did well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s annoying, being patronized to by a child, but that\\u2019s probably intentional,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you\\u2019ve thanked me and apologized several times tonight.\\xa0 I get suspicious when you act that way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably smart,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPretty much,\\u201d Helen said, chipper.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy\\u2019s a <em>jerk</em>,\\u201d Lillian said, with a hair too much emphasis.</p>\\n<p>Lacey rolled her eyes.\\xa0 She turned to go.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t make it three steps before I started following her, flashing a quick grin to the others, who sat and stared.</p>\\n<p>Three seconds later, when we were almost out of the room, Lacey stopped, spinning in place.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t quite quick enough to duck into cover.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you have eyes in the back of your head?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t make a sound.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou didn\\u2019t,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut they didn\\u2019t either.\\xa0 And when the room is that quiet and I have that niggling feeling of doubt deep inside\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou get suspicious enough to act on it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat were you doing?\\u201d she asked, sounding as tired as she was stern.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe file.\\xa0 I wanted a peek at the file.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She held up the file that Briggs had given her.\\xa0 Supposedly whatever Hayle had been so emotional about earlier in the evening, when I\\u2019d undercut him in going to Briggs for the badge.\\xa0 Part of it, at least.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt isn\\u2019t classified,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I know Briggs is strict about those things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She opened the folder.\\xa0 She took her time reading it.\\xa0 Rubbing it in, making me ache from head to toe with the <em>yearning</em> to know.</p>\\n<p>She could get revenge for <em>everything</em> I\\u2019d subjected her to by turning around and walking away right then.</p>\\n<p>I sensed it.\\xa0 That she was going to do it.\\xa0 It was in her body language, the tension in her legs, the angle of her body.\\xa0 It was in her expression, which was far from being a proper poker face.\\xa0 A smirk in hiding.</p>\\n<p>The expression changed.</p>\\n<p>That put me off balance.\\xa0 I shifted my weight from foot to foot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d she told me.\\xa0 \\u201cHands behind your back.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want you running away with this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, hands going behind my back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t going to show you, but you should read it,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Which only piqued my curiosity before.\\xa0 If she pulled it away <em>now</em>, I probably would have jumped her, improvised weapon in hand.\\xa0 I wouldn\\u2019t have gotten the information I wanted, but I would\\u2019ve at least burned off some of the nervous, frustrated energy in me.</p>\\n<p>She lowered the file to the point where I could read it.</p>\\n<p>My eyes scanned the page.</p>\\n<p>Nothing special.</p>\\n<p>Nothing special.\\xa0 Boring legal wording.</p>\\n<p>I felt a chill at the third offered provision.</p>\\n<p>The fourth jarred me to my core.</p>\\n<p>My hands, previously behind my back, dropped to my sides.\\xa0 I swallowed hard.\\xa0 \\u201cBut\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not <em>surprised</em>, are you?\\u201d she asked, and her voice was soft.\\xa0 \\u201cYou know who Hayle is, how he operates.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head, \\u201cBut\\u2026 really?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t say,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t be until next year.\\xa0 Even then, it would take some time before you had to worry on any level.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI almost- I thought-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My hands went up to my hair, clutching at it a little.\\xa0 A part of me wanted to cry, all of a sudden.\\xa0 The buzz from our successful dealings with the Shepherd was gone.</p>\\n<p>She reached out to put a hand on my wet hair, knocking my hands out of the way in the process.\\xa0 Again, they dropped to my sides.\\xa0 I left them there.\\xa0 She gave me a tentative pat on the head, as if I were a stray dog.\\xa0 Her voice was gentle, a kindness that I would have called hypocritical, before.\\xa0 \\u201cGo home.\\xa0 Get your new Lamb settled in.\\xa0 Tell them, so they know.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll tell Lillian as I walk her to her dormitory.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Numb, I nodded.</p>\\n<p>I felt like I was in a daze as I rejoined the others.\\xa0 They clustered around me.</p>\\n<p>I knew that they were hungry for information in ways that were very different from how <em>I</em> was insatiably curious, but they didn\\u2019t push.\\xa0 Their concern was for me.\\xa0 Whatever my expression or body language was like, it seemed to worry them.</p>\\n<p>Even Lillian seemed reluctant to step away and join Lacey in heading into the Academy grounds.\\xa0 She cast me a backward glance.</p>\\n<p>The others ushered me out the door.\\xa0 The coach we\\u2019d taken to arrive was still there, manned by a stitched driver.\\xa0 We climbed in, Gordon the last to file in through the door, stopping to give the driver instructions on where to go.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t a long ride.\\xa0 Just down the road.</p>\\n<p>I was so used to my thoughts running along multiple tracks, too busy to stay on one subject, but in this, I didn\\u2019t have the energy.\\xa0 I watched out the window, and my brain was slow, chugging along, the majority of my focus set on trying <em>not</em> to think.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d taken the expiration dates in stride.\\xa0 I\\u2019d expected it almost from the beginning.</p>\\n<p>This was harder to handle, in an ironic way.</p>\\n<p>The others murmured in conversation the entire way back.\\xa0 All the same, the words were noise, my thoughts were on some musing about how Radham worked as a kind of motte and bailey, which was a safe way of thinking, unless I thought too much about Radham Academy.\\xa0 The loosely defended city, the fortress that residents could retreat to if they had to.\\xa0 In time of serious attack, people could enter the Academy, wait out the enemy while bombarding them and defending the nigh-impenetrable walls, and then exit to rebuild and live in the city once again.</p>\\n<p>Safety.\\xa0 Safe way of thinking.\\xa0 My brain was tired.</p>\\n<p>I was surprised when the coach stopped.\\xa0 Time had passed too quickly and too slowly at the same time.\\xa0 I felt dazed.</p>\\n<p><em>Mary</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWelcome home, Mary,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>My words seemed to startle a few of the others.\\xa0 Only Helen smiled throughout, unflinching.\\xa0 The others looked concerned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m really glad to have you with us,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 But she looked disconcerted.</p>\\n<p>We made our way inside, not opening umbrellas, but flipping up hoods and dashing for the door.\\xa0 Again, Gordon was the last to follow, giving word to the coach driver to return to the Academy.\\xa0 He <em>should</em> have been trained to go back anyway, but it was always better to be safe than sorry.</p>\\n<p>Mrs. Earles was waiting up for us, and joined us in the hallway before we had all of our coats and boots off.\\xa0 In hushed tones, so as not to wake the younger ones, she urged us upstairs, promising us tea.</p>\\n<p><em>Mary needs attention</em>, I thought, and this was the new focus.\\xa0 Not idle thoughts, but getting her settled.\\xa0 I found her hand, and was surprised at how tightly she clutched it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary\\u2019s sharing the right corner room with Helen,\\u201d Mrs. Earles said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ve moved Helen\\u2019s stuff and Mary\\u2019s luggage over.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nearly tripped, she was so startled by the announcement.\\xa0 I had her hand, and Gordon put a hand out to catch her.\\xa0 When she straightened, she had a look in her eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, I\\u2019m harmless.\\u201d Helen whispered, then she made a tiny, excited sound, barely keeping her volume down, \\u201cOne room for the two of us!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Our resident monster skipped ahead, stepping exactly where she needed to step to avoid the creaking of floorboards.</p>\\n<p>Mary looked <em>more</em> disturbed in the wake of it.</p>\\n<p>I was puzzled more than anything, and the puzzlement added to my general lack of focus.\\xa0 Helen was <em>different</em>, and I couldn\\u2019t put my finger on it.\\xa0 I resolved to ask.\\xa0 But, again, Mary was the priority.\\xa0 I tried to pull myself together.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan <em>I</em> share a room with Mary?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot at all.\\xa0 That wouldn\\u2019t be proper,\\u201d Mrs. Earles said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou stay with Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wished I had the badge, so I could show her and make her listen.\\xa0 She <em>was</em> an Academy employee, in a roundabout way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to talk before bed,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd we haven\\u2019t eaten.\\xa0 Could you please get something?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mrs. Earles gave him a disapproving look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn my word,\\u201d he said, with utmost sincerity.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s important, and I\\u2019m ravenous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGet changed, I\\u2019ll have crackers, cheese and meat, with some treated tea.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he whispered.</p>\\n<p>She gave him a pat on the shoulder.</p>\\n<p>We headed into our individual rooms.\\xa0 Gordon already had one corner room, but it was a tiny space, cut off by the stairs that went up to the third floor, where Mrs. Earles\\u2019 bedroom was.\\xa0 Mary and Helen\\u2019s room was usually reserved for older girls or girls who were expecting to be adopted out.\\xa0 It was a treat.\\xa0 No sleeping in a room with four or five other girls.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I changed as quickly as we were able, which meant I was done before Jamie had his shirt off.\\xa0 I went out of my way to avoid looking, though I\\u2019d seen many times before.</p>\\n<p>When he pulled his pants off, though, I turned my back altogether.</p>\\n<p>We all had our burdens, we all needed support in our own ways.\\xa0 This was one of Jamie\\u2019s ways.</p>\\n<p>He put a hand on my shoulder, signaling it was okay for me to turn around.\\xa0 He had pyjamas that buttoned down the front.\\xa0 My own was only a sleeveless and undersized workman\\u2019s shirt that showed how horribly skinny my shoulders and arms were, along with pyjama bottoms.\\xa0 I hated being confined in clothes while I slept, but Jamie tended to wake me up by swatting me with his book if I slept without anything at all.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t help that I kicked my sheets off, most nights.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m so tired,\\u201d Jamie admitted.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I have so much to write in my book before bed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He gave me a <em>look</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo mischief, I promise.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll write down everything as I remember it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think I can read your handwriting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll <em>try</em>, for real,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can add stuff after, fill in blanks as you need to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Maybe.\\xa0 That thing with the names, starting the riot?\\xa0 That was incredible,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was terrified.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was incredible,\\u201d I said, again.</p>\\n<p>We reached the kitchen and began to dine on salty crackers with slices of cheese and meat.\\xa0 I went for the cheese first.</p>\\n<p>Gordon joined us, but he went for the meat, naturally.</p>\\n<p>And then there were the two girls.\\xa0 Helen and Mary.\\xa0 Both wore long nightgowns, white and riddled with lace, though Mary\\u2019s had a ribbon at the collar.</p>\\n<p>I drew in a deep breath.\\xa0 I felt a horrible pressure on my chest.</p>\\n<p>The others didn\\u2019t push, and Mary seemed to be following the others\\u2019 lead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI have to ask\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes?\\u201d\\xa0 Unlike Gordon, who was eating about three pieces of meat to every piece of cheese and every cracker, she was eating exclusively meat slices, gathered together and rolled up into tubes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s with this new you?\\xa0 You\\u2019ve been different.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh!\\xa0 Oh.\\xa0 I had my thing with Professor Ibbot last month, and a check-up just a couple of days ago,\\u201d she said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cHe got upset with me.\\xa0 He hit me a few times.\\xa0 Not hard enough to do any damage, but, just because.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was silent.\\xa0 I had a lump in my throat already, and I didn\\u2019t like hearing this.</p>\\n<p>Her smile widened a bit.\\xa0 \\u201cHe said I shouldn\\u2019t slack off.\\xa0 That I couldn\\u2019t just stop acting.\\xa0 It was something I had to practice.\\xa0 So I\\u2019m practicing.\\xa0 I\\u2019m trying to figure out who Helen Ibbot should be when she\\u2019s not acting for someone else.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re a perfect actor already.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t really need to practice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe told me to, so I will,\\u201d she said, very firmly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI liked the old Helen,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe one who didn\\u2019t feel like she had to smile.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were nods from Jamie and Gordon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s too bad,\\u201d Helen said, in a very matter of fact way.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to have to get used to the new me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, feeling a touch more lost than before.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t like that.\\xa0 I wanted to hurt Ibbot for it, but I wasn\\u2019t sure how, or if it was even possible, or right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on, Sy?\\xa0 Does that have anything to do with the file?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I ran my fingers through my hair again.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 I\\u2019m just\\u2026 not wanting to dwell on it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>I drew in a deep breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere were provisions.\\xa0 Things Briggs was giving Hayle, things Hayle wanted.\\xa0 The first was money, funding.\\xa0 The second was manpower, extra space.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe knew that much,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe third, it\\u2019s not fun to hear, but I already talked to you guys about this.\\xa0 About the expiration dates.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou brought it up,\\u201d Gordon said, his tone suddenly different, very careful.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd <em>I</em> told you that if you ever <em>dare</em> to tell me or hint to me what my date is, I will never forgive you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd I believe you,\\u201d I said, very quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll never tell you, and since the others aren\\u2019t asking, I won\\u2019t tell them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.</p>\\n<p><em>Even though you\\u2019re supposed to die first, </em>I thought.</p>\\n<p>My expression didn\\u2019t betray a thing.\\xa0 I sighed.\\xa0 \\u201cBriggs authorized replacements.\\xa0 When we die, when we <em>break</em>, according to Briggs\\u2019 terminology, then there will be new, better Lambs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot so surprising,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve heard hints of that before, from my caretakers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cBut it\\u2019s not fun to hear.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not it, is it?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat got to you this badly?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2026 I almost fucked it up,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2026 uh.\\xa0 Ugh.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t get over the fact that I almost fucked it up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re reviving the other projects?\\u201d Helen guessed.\\xa0 \\u201cEvette or Ashton?\\xa0 They\\u2019re going to take another try, start over from scratch?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was clever enough to connect the dots.\\xa0 Head in my hands, I nodded.</p>\\n<p>The silence that followed only added to the weight on my chest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne project,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHayle wanted to revive one project, and in my dicking around with the badges, I almost took that away.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not surprising at all,\\u201d Gordon said, leaning back in his chair.\\xa0 \\u201cWe always knew you were a disaster waiting to happen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWow,\\u201d I said, sitting straighter.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Wow</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>But the words lifted the burden, in a small way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve almost gotten any one of us killed a half dozen times already,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy does this matter?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause I trust you guys to handle yourselves.\\xa0 But these two\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI get it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOur little siblings,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to get one of them back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I smiled a little, even.\\xa0 \\u201cBut that\\u2019s a year off.\\xa0 We already have one new Lamb.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHear hear,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She would be second last to go.</p>\\n<p>We raised our mugs and clunked them together.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHear hear,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He wouldn\\u2019t die, but he would expire a year after Gordon, if the files were right.\\xa0 I suspected he already knew, and that knowledge defined him on a level.</p>\\n<p>Mary smiled, and it was genuine.\\xa0 She was one of us, and it was the sort of thing she\\u2019d craved for a very long time.\\xa0 It was like a warmth was flowing out from within her.\\xa0 Our little killer, and I had no idea when she would expire, there was no way to find out, and there was something safe in that.</p>\\n<p>She met my eyes, and I smiled at her.</p>\\n<p>Me, who would outlast the rest, and who would wish I hadn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p><a

language changed, as she craned her head, looking in the direction of the Academy.\\xa0 She asked a question, and Jamie pointed to the Academy.\\xa0 Lacey hesitated, then headed indoors.</p>\\n<p>I started my descent the moment she was gone.\\xa0 Out to the front face of the building, down the branches, touching the street.\\xa0 For all that the \\u2018quarantine\\u2019 was in effect, students forming a loose circle around the school, one team erecting a tent near the entrance, I wasn\\u2019t spotted.</p>\\n<p>Getting past the perimeter that was in progress was another story.</p>\\n<p><em>Walk with confidence, as if you don\\u2019t expect to get caught.\\xa0 Be small, take advantage of your size.</em></p>\\n<p>People didn\\u2019t want to disturb norms.\\xa0 If one looked like they fit into the greater scheme of things, then it took a kind of courage to step away from the herd and stand out, challenging that.\\xa0 Doubly so when schools or the Academy were involved.</p>\\n<p>It was often easier to avoid the attention of ten people than it was to avoid the attention of one.\\xa0 Even scratches, bumps, bruises, and being soaked to the bone became invisible if one had the poise.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey, you,\\u201d one of the students called out as he intercepted me.</p>\\n<p><em>Apparently I don\\u2019t have the poise.\\xa0</em></p>\\n<p>I suppressed a sigh.\\xa0 I pitched my voice just a bit higher, my eyes wide.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m supposed to be in my dorm.\\xa0 What\\u2019s going on?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not- you were coming in the other direction.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou let me walk by you,\\u201d I said, a little breathless, panicky, \\u201cthen I got scared because there are so many people and then I turned around and I\\u2019m supposed to be in my dorm, why, what\\u2019s going on?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t let you walk by us,\\u201d one said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou did!\\u201d I said, in the tone that only children could pull off.\\xa0 One hundred percent certainty.\\xa0 Adults learned to doubt themselves, but a child could truly <em>believe</em>.</p>\\n<p>I saw the doubt on their faces.\\xa0 I latched on it.\\xa0 \\u201cYou let me walk by just now.\\xa0 Why are you lying?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d I asked, cutting him off.\\xa0 <em>Keep him off balance.</em></p>\\n<p>I saw the glance, the shift in his gaze.\\xa0 His lips parted, about to speak.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou-\\u201d I started.</p>\\n<p>But he ignored me, reaching for my hand, hauling it up and away from my pocket.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re bleeding,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p><em>Drat.</em></p>\\n<p>Just my luck, I couldn\\u2019t get an Academy student who was in it for the power or prestige.\\xa0 He had to care about the profession.</p>\\n<p>Bully for him, it probably made him a more effective student in the long run, but it didn\\u2019t help me right now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s with me,\\u201d I heard a voice state, behind me.</p>\\n<p>I cringed a little, glancing back.\\xa0 Lacey, who had one hand on her hip.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t mean anything to me,\\u201d the student said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know him.\\xa0 He\\u2019s mentally unsound and a challenge to deal with.\\xa0 The blood on his hands is his own fault.\\xa0 He got away from his caretaker, and I need to get him back now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Dirty pool, Lacey</em>, I thought.\\xa0 I looked up at the student, my eyes wide, my lips now slightly parted, tongue visible between my teeth.\\xa0 Nothing obvious, but still playing along.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf he was in the school-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe was telling the truth,\\u201d Lacey said.\\xa0 She put a hand on my shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cYou let him walk right by you.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll vouch that he wasn\\u2019t anywhere near the sensitive areas, <em>and</em> I\\u2019ll stay quiet about your lapse<em>.\\xa0 </em>If you don\\u2019t make us miss our coach.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The student glanced over at the coach where the others were already getting seated, then stepped out of the way.</p>\\n<p>Lacey guided me, her grip on my shoulder a little firmer than it needed to be.\\xa0 Rather, she was digging her fingernails in as if she thought I was going to run away.</p>\\n<p>We made our way to the coach.\\xa0 Gordon was apparently in another coach, being looked after by a few of the collected students assigned to our projects, but Helen, Jamie, Mary and Lil were inside the waiting coach.\\xa0 Lil had an empty syringe in hand, and Helen was occupying the whole bench beside her, head on Lil\\u2019s lap, eyes partially closed.</p>\\n<p>No adults sat inside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou came back pretty quick,\\u201d Jamie spoke to Lacey.\\xa0 \\u201cSecond thoughts?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI find that when I\\u2019m dealing with Sylvester, directly or peripherally, and I have the little doubt in the back of my mind, I have to take a moment and second guess what I\\u2019m doing.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t expect it from you, Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought he\\u2019d come down if you left.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought as much.\\xa0 I asked myself, what is the most inconvenient thing he could do?\\xa0 Making me search the school for him, only to find the coach was gone when I step outside.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shrugged my way free of her claw-grip and climbed up into the coach.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGoodbye, Sylvester,\\u201d Lacey spoke to my back.</p>\\n<p>I collapsed into the cushioned seat and looked her way, an eyebrow raised.\\xa0 The goodbye felt meaningful.\\xa0 Her expression was dead serious, driving that idea home.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought about what you said,\\u201d she told me.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what to say except that you\\u2019re right.\\xa0 You win.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve asked to be taken off your project.\\xa0 Professor Hayle agreed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I was very aware that Mary was watching this exchange between Lacey and I.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to make excuses, justify, argue, give any one of a number of responses.\\xa0 But I\\u2019m doing it for my sake, if I remember right, not for yours.\\xa0 I guess the only thing I have left to say is that it\\u2019s your loss in the end, Sylvester.\\xa0 You need people who know you and your history.\\xa0 How you\\u2019ve developed, how you operate, what you need.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I also need the autonomy to decide who I work with.\\xa0 You say you know me, you get how I operate, in a lot of ways.\\xa0 You see that as a good thing, but it\\u2019s the opposite for me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She gave me a long, hard look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGoodbye, Sylvester,\\u201d she said, for the second time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGoodbye, Lacey,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She shut the door to the coach.</p>\\n<p>A moment later we were in motion, on our way to the Academy.</p>\\n<p>No chaperones, which felt odd.\\xa0 Was that Hayle\\u2019s call?\\xa0 Someone else\\u2019s?\\xa0 It was convenient, but if Mary decided to strangle me with the chain, I wasn\\u2019t sure how good of a fight we\\u2019d put up in these tight quarters.</p>\\n<p>She sat just to my right, and she was completely silent.\\xa0 A little damp, now, rumpled, her ribbons gone, hair loose and in need of a combing.\\xa0 Her wrists were shackled, the shackles themselves thick and heavy, with proper chains that a bull couldn\\u2019t have broken.\\xa0 A blanket was draped over her lap, but the outline was unmistakeable.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d been disarmed, though I doubted everything had been collected.\\xa0 She was too careful.</p>\\n<p>Too delicate right now.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t poke or test her.\\xa0 Dangerous.</p>\\n<p>I turned to look away, and saw Jamie was writing in his notebook.</p>\\n<p>Not writing.\\xa0 Sketching.</p>\\n<p>My face, looking in Mary\\u2019s general direction.</p>\\n<p>The pen went still.\\xa0 When I looked up from the pen\\u2019s tip, Jamie was staring at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I asked, uncomfortable.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was nice of you,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m never nice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a damn liar, and you\\u2019re lying about not being nice,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou messed with Lacey-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich is very <em>not</em> nice,\\u201d I pointed out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-And you told her why you did it,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told her it was because she pitied me and pretended to be nice, which wasn\\u2019t wrong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve handled worse without flinching,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou just gave her the <em>real</em> reason.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I closed my eyes and let my head move back until it hit the padded back wall of the coach.\\xa0 The wall vibrated with the movement of the wheels over the road.</p>\\n<p>When I heard the scratch of the pen on paper, I chanced a look at Jamie\\u2019s work.</p>\\n<p>The sketch was left unfinished, but was being captioned.\\xa0 \\u2018Sly, after a rare moment of kindness.\\u2019</p>\\n<p>I rolled my eyes and closed them.</p>\\n<p>Two mistakes in a relatively short span of time.\\xa0 Getting caught by the student at the quarantine perimeter, and how I\\u2019d dealt with Lacey.\\xa0 I was <em>tired, </em>my brain too active for too long.\\xa0 I was starting to stumble.</p>\\n<p>Except the night wasn\\u2019t quite over yet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomeone\\u2019s gone ahead, we should have an escort when we arrive,\\u201d Jamie commented.\\xa0 \\u201cFor our passenger.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave Mary another look, and saw her looking outside the window.\\xa0 Watching the rain-soaked city pass us by, the lights, the streetlamps, and rare figure standing in the dark.</p>\\n<p>Was one of them the puppeteer?</p>\\n<p>Her mind was roaming, her thoughts escaping the confines of the coach to focus on what lay beyond, very possibly dwelling on the puppeteer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mary startled at the sound of my voice, or because it was <em>Helen</em> that I named?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you have a comb?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She produced a small comb from a shallow pocket in her uniform dress.\\xa0 Rather than make her move, I rose from my seat and took it from her hand, before letting myself fall hard against my cushioned seat.</p>\\n<p>I held it up for Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cSo you can feel more like yourself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know who myself is,\\u201d she said, but she took the comb and began working it through her hair.\\xa0 There were more than a few tangles that required sharp, violent tugs to figure out.</p>\\n<p>Couldn\\u2019t push too hard.\\xa0 Just had to make sure she was grounded, focused on <em>us</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor now, let\\u2019s get through tonight,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t think any of us want you chained up.\\xa0 Except maybe you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She snapped her head around, looking offended.</p>\\n<p>Because I\\u2019d crossed a line, or because I was right?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou just said you don\\u2019t know who you are,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAre you, right this minute, someone who <em>wants</em> to be chained up?\\xa0 Saying yes or no doesn\\u2019t mean betraying <em>him</em> or threatening your standing with <em>us</em>.\\xa0 It\\u2019s about who you are in this moment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She made a face, looking out the window at the city once more<em>.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy?\\u201d Lil asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, <em>Lil</em>?\\u201d I replied, my response as syrupy as I could make it.</p>\\n<p>I saw the annoyance on her expression, but it didn\\u2019t distract her from what she was going to say: \\u201cDon\\u2019t be a butt.\\xa0 Leave her alone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The statement was forceful enough to catch me off guard.\\xa0 Surprise gave way to annoyance.\\xa0 <em>How about you trust me to know what I\\u2019m doing?</em></p>\\n<p>But Jamie must have seen something in my expression, because he gave me a light tap with his elbow.</p>\\n<p><em>Fine.</em></p>\\n<p>Fine.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t entirely on the ball, either.\\xa0 I was positive I wasn\\u2019t crossing the line, but that didn\\u2019t mean I couldn\\u2019t make more minor mistakes.</p>\\n<p>I gave Lil a smile, then let my head rest against the cushion.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you want me to patch you up?\\u201d\\xa0 Lil offered.\\xa0 \\u201cYour hands look bad.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A conciliatory gesture?\\xa0 She couldn\\u2019t recant what she\\u2019d said, but maybe she hadn\\u2019t meant it to come out as forcefully as it had.\\xa0 Fatigue affected her, too.\\xa0 Emotions were a drug with their own side effects, ebbs and flows, and after half a night of activity and a week of fearing for her life, she might not have been on point any more than I was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ll want to look us over anyway,\\u201d I said, closing my eyes.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019d be redundant.\\xa0 Relax instead, look after Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lil looked down, where Helen was sleeping.\\xa0 Tranquilized.</p>\\n<p>We were silent as the coach made its way through the streets, the stitched horses keeping up their hard patter of hoofbeat on roadtop.</p>\\n<p>We reached the Hedge, and there was more light there, less space between streetlights and streetlamps.\\xa0 A glance out the window showed the perimeter wall, lit up by the ambient light.\\xa0 It seemed to say \\u2018The Academy: A glowing beacon at the edge of Radham.\\u2019</p>\\n<p>Through a gate, and into the Academy proper.\\xa0 We passed the Rows, Claret Hall, and the Rise, heading straight for the Tower.</p>\\n<p>Mary was tense.\\xa0 Her shoulders were stiff, and she\\u2019d moved enough to make the chain move since the journey had begun.</p>\\n<p><em>Here we are</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been here before,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mary snapped her head around, as if unsure who I was talking to.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure who she expected it to be, but she seemed to figure out that I was talking to <em>her.\\xa0 </em>\\u201cVisits.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s all this is.\\xa0 A visit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne that decides my fate,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I shrugged, slow.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe.\\xa0 Is that why you\\u2019re so anxious?\\xa0 Or is it something else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou keep talking like you read my mind,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p><em>You\\u2019re more of an open book than the literal open book in Jamie\\u2019s lap</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not hard to figure out.\\xa0 You were told we\\u2019re the enemy.\\xa0 We\\u2019re the bad guy.\\xa0 Visits were visits.\\xa0 You knew where you stood.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d she said, the word curt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re going to want to talk to you, ask questions.\\xa0 Be ready for it.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t have to tell them everything, but <em>anything</em> you tell them will smooth things over.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t have anywhere to be, so I\\u2019ll be with you until we figure out where things stand.\\xa0 I\\u2019m your ally, your advocate, I offered you a place with us, I will make it happen.\\xa0 I <em>promise</em> things will be okay.\\xa0 \\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPromise,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 Not a question, not a statement, only an echo.</p>\\n<p>Did the word have a significance?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo they even agree with you?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>They?\\xa0 The other Lambsbridge orphans?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI trust Sy,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Helen murmured.\\xa0 She\\u2019d sensed the coach slowing down, and had roused.</p>\\n<p>I glanced at Lil, and sensed the hesitation.\\xa0 Mary would too.</p>\\n<p>But Lil said, \\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s expression didn\\u2019t change.\\xa0 Not deadpan, like Helen\\u2019s; it was a vaguely lost, heartbroken look that she had about her, and it was a look that didn\\u2019t offer any tells.</p>\\n<p>It suggested she was more comfortable or certain about what was going on than she had been a moment ago, when all the walls had been down and in ruins.</p>\\n<p>The coach stopped, and we made our way out, Lillian removing the blanket that covered Mary\\u2019s shackles, clumsily folding it and dropping it on the spot where Helen had been lying.\\xa0 One by one, we made our way out, passing the Stitched bodyguards on either side of the door.</p>\\n<p>When Mary reached the door, they seized her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo easy,\\u201d I told them.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a threat.\\xa0 You can stay close, but don\\u2019t manhandle her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The handlers for the two stitched bodyguards echoed my orders.\\xa0 The two bodyguards let go of Mary, leaving her free to follow a pace behind me.</p>\\n<p>We were on dry ground.\\xa0 At the base of the Tower, a roof had been set up so one side rested against the Tower itself, the other side propped up by a row of custom-grown trees.\\xa0 Stitched horses were lined up beneath, with cords and wires stringing them up to a rack of large metal cables that ran down one side of the tower.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was already out of the other coach, lying in a stretcher, with the team that worked on the Griffon project surrounding him.</p>\\n<p>Three students looked after me.\\xa0 Two, now that Lacey was gone.\\xa0 Nine looked after Jamie.\\xa0 Lillian had special tutoring and attention from a set of teachers, giving her support and care.\\xa0 Helen stood alone with no students or teachers to maintain and look after her, each one getting driven away in time, but she <em>did</em> have her black-coat professor.</p>\\n<p><em>Twelve</em> individuals looked after Gordon, and nine of those individuals were present, walking in a group around, ahead of, and trailing behind him as the stretcher was wheeled into the tower.\\xa0 I was willing to bet that more were inside.</p>\\n<p>The rest of us almost didn\\u2019t matter, while they were focused on their subject.\\xa0 Debating and discussing ways to move forward, consulting lists and charts.</p>\\n<p>He was in their hands.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t too worried about how it would turn out.</p>\\n<p>As they filtered away, we were left in the company of a few scattered students who stood closer to the Tower\\u2019s entrance.\\xa0 I recognized some as members of Jamie\\u2019s team, two men and two women who looked a little more tired than all the rest.\\xa0 I also spotted the two remaining members of <em>my</em> team, two men who were standing to one side, smoking.\\xa0 Behind us were the students who managed the stitched guards.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t realize how badly I was outnumbered,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I smiled at the notion.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t smile back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s the <em>Academy</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is a small department with a shortage of funding.\\xa0 You should see the manpower backing the other projects.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian, Jamie, Helen, Mary and I ventured closer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie,\\u201d one of Jamie\\u2019s project workers said.\\xa0 Older than the rest.\\xa0 \\u201cUh, a few questions, first, but Professor Hayle wanted to see her.\\xa0 Everyone\\u2019s to have their checkups, appointments, and testing.\\xa0 If you could give us a moment with Jamie-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave your moment,\\u201d I said, cutting him off.\\xa0 \\u201cNo rush.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My two remaining team members were Dewey and Alton, puffing away at cigarettes.\\xa0 Take away the white coats, and they could have passed for street toughs who were waiting to hold me at gunpoint and force me to empty my pockets.\\xa0 There was a brutishness to their builds and expressions.\\xa0 Alton had a heavy brow and an ugly look in his eye that Academy medicine couldn\\u2019t change.</p>\\n<p>Dewey\\u2019s face, by contrast, had seen too much of the Academy\\u2019s attention, smoothing all of his skin to the soft texture of baby\\u2019s bottom.\\xa0 I knew Dewey had been given treatment a few years back for a bad slouch, but habit had won out, and even now he was just a touch hunched over.\\xa0 His hair was blond and gossamer fine.</p>\\n<p>I knew where I stood with them.\\xa0 I knew that Alton had been signed on because of a mean streak and a bad disciplinary record from a school very much like Mothmont, while Dewey was, along with Lacey, the only one who\\u2019d been present from the beginning.\\xa0 He\\u2019d had been through lengthy and painful treatments for bad scarring he\\u2019d suffered as a child.\\xa0 In their own ways, they weren\\u2019t the type to flinch, and they were good enough at what they did.\\xa0 Lacey had just been <em>good</em>.\\xa0 I imagined she\\u2019d learned not to care, rather than starting out that way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou need anything?\\u201d Dewey asked.</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.\\xa0 \\u201cHad my appointment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He looked annoyed.\\xa0 \\u201cI know that.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t have any reason to stick around?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019d you say to Lacey that bothered her so much?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said, again.\\xa0 As if he was answering a question or statement.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know where to find you if I need you,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFind one of us in the office tomorrow,\\u201d he told me.\\xa0 \\u201cShould check levels.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>Easy.\\xa0 No dancing around, no tricks, no posturing.</p>\\n<p>Just business.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was talking to the others.\\xa0 His team.\\xa0 From what I overheard, he was trying to convince them that no, he didn\\u2019t need to stop by their office <em>now</em>.\\xa0 Yes, he would be there soon.\\xa0 Yes, he understood that people were present now.</p>\\n<p>My eye went to the book.\\xa0 He was holding it with both hands, but he wasn\\u2019t holding it with a deathgrip, he wasn\\u2019t hugging it.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t need help.</p>\\n<p>I retreated a bit, approaching the three girls at the edge of the canopy.\\xa0 Lil was talking to Mary while she fixed the bandage at Helen\\u2019s side.\\xa0 Helen seemed to be taking it in stride, arching one eyebrow as she glanced back at me.</p>\\n<p>The arch, much like the smiles, winks and nods, seemed to be for my benefit rather than her own.\\xa0 Little touches that made me feel more nervous around her, rather than <em>less</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026Mnemonic trick to figure out how things are laid out,\\u201d Lil said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrick?\\u201d Mary asked Lil.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a <em>body</em>.\\xa0 Each department has a focus.\\xa0 The Tower is the head.\\xa0 Record keeping.\\xa0 The Rise is the shoulders, or the collarbone, the neck, supporting structures, storage, think backpack.\\xa0 Then you have the Academy headquarters.\\xa0 Center of everything, Claret Hall-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe heart,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe rows,\\u201d Lil suggested, trailing off to give Mary the chance of offering an answer.</p>\\n<p>Mary shook her head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRibs.\\xa0 <em>Dormitories.\\xa0</em> I think of it as rows, ribs, bars, cage, zoo, students.\\xa0 That\\u2019s how I put it together in my head, drawing the connection.\\xa0 I started doing it from the beginning, but even though I <em>know</em>, I still sort of think that way.\\xa0 I make the connection like that,\\u201d Lil said.</p>\\n<p>She sounded so excited.\\xa0 A kid with a chance to show her stuff.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t a project, but she was clever in her own <em>normal</em> way.\\xa0 Exceptionally so, it could be said.\\xa0 Maybe it was because she\\u2019d been pushed to keep up with us, maybe it was because she was a rare breed.</p>\\n<p>But she wasn\\u2019t one of us.\\xa0 She had a family, a place to go home to.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you think the Hedge is?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>Mary started a little at the sound of my voice.\\xa0 \\u201cHedge?\\xa0 Exterior wall\\u2026 skin?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shrugged and nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cImmediate care, contact with the city outside, first line of healing and prevention.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes that help?\\u201d Lil asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelp?\\u201d I cut in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith feeling lost and overwhelmed in this place,\\u201d Lil said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt helps a little,\\u201d Mary said, in a way that didn\\u2019t convince me in the slightest.\\xa0 She moved her hands a bit to tug at her uniform top and the chains rattled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, that\\u2019s great!\\u201d Lil said, perking up, \\u201cSo, after the Rows, you have other main buildings.\\xa0 There\\u2019s the-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d a voice cut through the patter of rain on the canopy roof.\\xa0 It was a hard voice.</p>\\n<p>Lil\\u2019s train of thought crashed right there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIbott,\\u201d Mary murmured.</p>\\n<p>Ibott.\\xa0 He was someone who had been elevated to a position in society that didn\\u2019t suit him in the slightest.\\xa0 He was among the most brilliant minds at Radham, clever, not bad looking on the surface, he had the veneer of the upper class and none of the follow-through.\\xa0 His hair was neatly parted, set firmly in place by something that had a way of smelling rancid at the end of the day, leaving his hair locked into hard strings that crossed one corner of his forehead.\\xa0 His round eyeglasses were gold-rimmed, but so smudged I could barely see the eyes on the other side of the glass.</p>\\n<p>A name that might not have been known by <em>every</em> household, but was known to most.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI expected you earlier,\\u201d he said, and his phrasing was civil and proper, the tone far from it.\\xa0 \\u201cIn the future, you come straight inside and report to me.\\xa0 Do not make me come out here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p><em>But you\\u2019re not always here</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>Is she supposed to report regardless</em>?</p>\\n<p>Ibott seemed to think so, and now Helen would.</p>\\n<p>He was now close enough to speak to us without raising his voice.\\xa0 I sensed Lil shrinking back and shifted my position a little, to put myself between Ibott and her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re bleeding,\\u201d he observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExplain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Before she could, I spoke up, \\u201cSir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He ignored me.\\xa0 \\u201cI want to hear it from Helen.\\xa0 I certainly hope she <em>recalls</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester put me in harm\\u2019s way so we could capture our target,\\u201d Helen said, before I could say anything.\\xa0 \\u201cIt was the best way to get me to where I could be most effective.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I would have worded that better</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>I was barely finished the thought when Ibott struck me.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t a strong man, but he was several times my size, and he <em>was</em> a man.</p>\\n<p>The noise of the back of his hand connecting with my face made virtually every head present turn.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTake more care,\\u201d he instructed me.</p>\\n<p>I had to blink a few times before I was able to figure out that I was on my hands and knees.\\xa0 I opened my jaw yawning-wide, feeling it pop before I was able to work my mouth to form words.\\xa0 \\u201c\\u2026Yes sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen offered me her hand.\\xa0 I took it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo not help him up,\\u201d Ibott said.\\xa0 \\u201cCome.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen let my hand drop from hers, but she didn\\u2019t move.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood work tonight, Helen,\\u201d I murmured.</p>\\n<p>She turned and followed a step behind her creator.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s crowd and Dewey all took care to move out of the way as the pair entered the tower.</p>\\n<p>Conversation didn\\u2019t resume until the door shut behind Helen.</p>\\n<p>I ignored Lil\\u2019s offer for assistance in standing, and got to my own two feet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlways good for a first impression, Ibott is,\\u201d I said, glancing at Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t understand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf he wanted to, he\\u2019d run Radham,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe doesn\\u2019t want to, but he still has that clout.\\xa0 Not what I would have wanted you to see while trying to win you over.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re assuming I have someplace else to go,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p><em>Yeah,</em> I thought, <em>I am.\\xa0 But maybe you don\\u2019t see all the options that really lie in front of you</em>.</p>\\n<p>I saw Jamie shift his grip on his book.\\xa0 Head bent a little, arms crossed over the notebook\\u2019s leather-bound cover.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLil,\\u201d I said, without taking my eyes off him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Lillian</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know how to say it without sounding like I\\u2019m telling you to go away, but\\u2026 if you wanted to go to your room and get a good night\\u2019s sleep, this wouldn\\u2019t be a bad time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat <em>does</em> sound like you\\u2019re trying to get rid of me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cPillow, covers, your own room, peace and quiet\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNightmares,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think you\\u2019re going to have <em>less</em> nightmares, if you spend more time hanging around us?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>She made a face.</p>\\n<p>But she flipped her hood up, picked up her bag, and headed down the long road to the middle area of the University, where the Rows radiated out around Claret Hall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I grabbed Mary\\u2019s chain, tugging a bit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t,\\u201d she said, suddenly tense, resisting the pull.</p>\\n<p>Which a student and a stitched bodyguard took as leave to give her a push.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCooperate,\\u201d the student called out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s fine,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cReally, it\\u2019s fine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>But it didn\\u2019t feel fine.\\xa0 Jamie was shrinking into himself more, glancing my way as his group led him inside.\\xa0 I was caught between the two.\\xa0 Couldn\\u2019t abandon Mary at this stage, but letting Jamie go ahead without giving support\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease, Mary,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mary hesitated, then obeyed.</p>\\n<p>We covered ground quickly, Mary\\u2019s chain rattling, but I had to hold the door for her, and then the stitched bodyguards and their handlers were right behind us, wanting to keep an eye on Mary, and all in all, it was clumsy and awkward, and it took some time for us to catch up with the brisk, businesslike strides.</p>\\n<p>I pushed past students in lab coats to get to Jamie.</p>\\n<p>He unwrapped his arms from the book, and after a moment\\u2019s pause, he handed it to me.</p>\\n<p>I took it with reverent care, and held it securely in my arms.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSee you,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSoon,\\u201d I replied.</p>\\n<p><em>Griffon getting pieced back together.\\xa0 Galatea in the care of her maker, who is as different from her as night from day</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>And the Caterpillar\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>I watched the caterpillar disappear down the length of the hall.</p>\\n<p><em>Appointment</em> was the wrong word.</p>\\n<p>I rubbed the side of my face, where I knew I\\u2019d bruise, then turned to Mary.\\xa0 We were as alone as we\\u2019d get, with our stitched escort.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wanted to show you better,\\u201d I told Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cI want to show you Lambsbridge.\\xa0 How we have a home, how we have each other.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have his book,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think I get it, even if I don\\u2019t understand the details.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not sure I would have believed whatever you <em>meant</em> to show me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The perils of being an established liar.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want you to be one of us,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think I might want to be,\\u201d she replied.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019ll have to do,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>We had nine flights of stairs to climb, and when I offered to hold up the midsection of the chain to alleviate the weight of it, she didn\\u2019t resist.</p>\\n<p>When we arrived in Hayle\\u2019s office, he didn\\u2019t seem to miss that detail, either.\\xa0 I saw his gaze linger where my hand held the metal links.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDog and Catcher are after Percy,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 I noted how he watched Mary.\\xa0 It seemed he\\u2019d been filled in on my intentions there, too.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s work, no doubt.\\xa0 Keeping everything in order, making sure the messages were passed along.</p>\\n<p>Mary didn\\u2019t flinch or react.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe pursuit would have been easier if you hadn\\u2019t burned down Percy\\u2019s home,\\u201d Hayle told me.</p>\\n<p><em>I</em> reacted to that.\\xa0 I blinked a few times, trying to organize my thoughts and work through the shoddier bits of my memory.\\xa0 \\u201cI didn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hayle leaned back in his chair.\\xa0 \\u201cYou didn\\u2019t?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDog and Catcher say it wasn\\u2019t Percy who did it.\\xa0 They would have had the scent, even with the rain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t have an answer for you,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do,\\u201d Mary said, her voice soft.\\xa0 \\u201cThe plan was\\u2026 more complex than I think you understand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cComplex how?\\u201d Hayle asked, his pale eyebrows rising.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe children we were copied from, he had to do something with them.\\xa0 He sold them, to others with ambitions in line with his,\\u201d she said, and she couldn\\u2019t maintain eye contact, staring down at the ground instead.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a group.\\xa0 One he tried to keep secret from even <em>me</em>.\\xa0 And it\\u2019s a lot bigger than you\\u2019d think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/04/07/taking-root-1-11/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>This was what I lived for.\\xa0 Literally speaking.</p>\\n<p>I knew my enemy now.\\xa0 I knew where she was weak, where she was strong.\\xa0 I knew how dangerous she was, and through all of that I could make assumptions about the others in the school.\\xa0 I might have preferred to know where she was and interact with her from a safe vantage point, but this was the next best thing.</p>\\n<p>I knew that the best way to handle this would be to get to the puppeteer, Mr. Percy, and deal with him before anything else.\\xa0 He was hurt, my odds weren\\u2019t that bad.\\xa0 Once he fell, the others would fall.\\xa0 I knew that Mary knew the same thing, and would react accordingly.\\xa0 She knew I knew, and I knew <em>that</em>.</p>\\n<p>Ad infinitum.</p>\\n<p>I liked these games, when the system broke down.\\xa0 It was no longer about how good we were at predicting and planning.\\xa0 We were both just good enough that we wouldn\\u2019t get ahead of the other by that alone.\\xa0 It was about understanding the other, and I had the edge there.</p>\\n<p>The yard was dangerous.\\xa0 Too wide a space with no cover.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s space.</p>\\n<p>That left me the school itself, hallways and classrooms for places I could navigate without exposing myself.\\xa0 If I made it far enough, then I\\u2019d be in the back of the school, with the dorm rooms, showers, kitchen, and the boiler rooms in the basement.</p>\\n<p>The Lambsbridge gang would be back there, I was fairly certain.</p>\\n<p>I stopped where I was, beside a classroom door that was already open, something to keep me out of sight while not getting in my way.\\xa0 The only light that filtered through was from outside, passing through windows on the outside that fit older styles, square and proper and framed, illuminating bits of the classroom, then touching the windows inside the hallways, where it was all broken glass secured in place with custom-grown branches.\\xa0 The light that reached me was faint and mottled, like the light that might filter through a heavy forest canopy.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t move forward until I knew how Mary would react.\\xa0 Who was she?\\xa0 How would the others read her, assuming I\\u2019d filled them in on the particulars?</p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019s dangerous, she prefers to stay at arm\\u2019s length.\\xa0 Throwing weapons, pistol, poison.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not just a fear of you, it\\u2019s how she is</em>, I imagined Gordon telling me.</p>\\n<p>Helen might say something like: <em>The puppeteer raised her with care and a great deal of control.\\xa0 A special trigger phrase to keep her compliant if she started to slip the leash.\\xa0 He waited to use it, so it wouldn\\u2019t have been a common thing.\\xa0 Remember everything we said about why he raised them at Mothmont.\\xa0 Control and a firm hand.\\xa0 Somewhere he could be close to them and steer them.</em></p>\\n<p>Except not in so many words.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was a hard one for me to guess.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t slip myself into Jamie\\u2019s shoes and imagine what he\\u2019d say because Jamie would be the type to call up some obscure set of details.\\xa0 He had a good memory, while mine was below average.\\xa0 But Jamie would also have a sense of the building layout.\\xa0 He could sketch out a quick map in that book of his, I could stare down at it, put all the pieces together, and start to imagine where Mary might have entered the building, where she might have positioned herself.</p>\\n<p>I tried to imagine the building as well as I knew it, but it wasn\\u2019t a complete map, and parts of it were nebulous, the scale not quite right.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t draw a <em>sharp</em> picture, not a crisp image that stayed still in my mind\\u2019s eye.</p>\\n<p>Then there was Lillian.\\xa0 Not an Academy project, except she was, in a way.\\xa0 She\\u2019d grown up with the Academy in mind, had spent some time at Mothmont, and went on to be one of the Academy\\u2019s younger students.\\xa0 Her family wasn\\u2019t so wealthy that she would thrive regardless of what happened.\\xa0 She\\u2019d had to throw herself into her studies, into our activities, just to secure her future.\\xa0 The Academy had its claws in her.</p>\\n<p>Lillian would share something about the science of the clones.\\xa0 Maybe explain how the trigger phrase worked.</p>\\n<p>\\u2026Or, now that I thought about it, she might surprise us and say something very human.\\xa0 Something like, <em>she was so cold around you, but she let her guard down around him.\\xa0 She even cried.</em></p>\\n<p>I imagined that as the moment I could pull the pieces together and get an idea of where Mary might be lurking.\\xa0 I could formulate a plan and enact it.\\xa0 But imagination was only imagination, and as much as it helped to put myself into others\\u2019 heads and look at things from set angles, I was missing pieces of it.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s map, the extra tidbits that I could never come up with on my own.</p>\\n<p>But I still had an impression of where Mary was, even if I couldn\\u2019t pinpoint the exact location.\\xa0 Given how much she cared about the puppeteer, how afraid she was of me, there had to be a comfort zone.\\xa0 A certain range she might wander, where she could potentially keep an eye out for me while still watching him.</p>\\n<p>My head slowly turned.\\xa0 End of the hallway.\\xa0 Either one of the classrooms on either side, the last classrooms at that end of the hall.\\xa0 Everything beyond that was offices.\\xa0 More likely to be locked tight, too close to him, not close enough to observe me.</p>\\n<p>What else?</p>\\n<p>The yard?\\xa0 I\\u2019d called it her territory.\\xa0 She could look in the windows just as well as I could look out, and it gave her a lot of range of movement.</p>\\n<p>I started to imagine a Mary at each of those points.\\xa0 A phantom image lurking in shadow, just out of sight.</p>\\n<p>The puppeteer was her weak point.\\xa0 When he was strong, he could give her strength, centering her.\\xa0 When he was weak or in danger, she cracked.\\xa0 The brick I\\u2019d thrown at him had been aimed at her, in an abstract way.\\xa0 That in mind, I was willing to bet that she was devoting more thought to how to protect him than how to catch me if I tried to break away and run.</p>\\n<p>Strings extended from him to the phantom Marys.\\xa0 An abstraction of the fundamental hold he had on her.\\xa0 They were strings that could snap, if given cause, but there was a resistance.\\xa0 Tension.\\xa0 Anything she did would always, <em>always</em> be prefaced by a concern for him.\\xa0 A momentary worry.</p>\\n<p>That was the tool I had to use.</p>\\n<p>I could make out a heavy, low sound further down the hallway.\\xa0 A large object being set down, a book being dropped.</p>\\n<p><em>What are you doing, Mary</em>?\\xa0 I wondered.</p>\\n<p>The phantom images were suddenly busy.\\xa0 Enacting various scenes and scenarios.\\xa0 Mary, anxious, making a mistake.\\xa0 Mary intentionally making a sound to distract, then slipping closer toward me.\\xa0 Mary setting a trap, a deadfall or a heavy object that held down a tripwire, impossible to see in the dark.</p>\\n<p>It was very possible that she didn\\u2019t <em>just</em> have weapons.\\xa0 Poison, wire, any number of things could be stowed away in and around her uniform.\\xa0 I liked traps, but they were hardly exclusive to me alone.</p>\\n<p>It was an approach that let her actively protect the puppeteer while keeping the right position respective to me and the man.</p>\\n<p><em>If</em> that was what she was doing.</p>\\n<p>I was visualizing her at the end of the hallway, or in one of the adjacent classrooms.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t thinking about the yard.</p>\\n<p>I raised myself up, head snapping over to look into the window of the classroom beside me, past desks and chairs to the window that looked out into the yard.</p>\\n<p>Between the rain and the branches, there was no way to tell if she was there, moving around to circle behind me, or if it was just weather and gloom playing tricks with my eyes.</p>\\n<p><em>Think twice, Sy</em>, I told myself, going back to thinking about Mary being at any one of the positions in a quarter-circle around me.\\xa0 Right classroom, hall, left classroom, yard.</p>\\n<p><em>This is why Gordon gets on my case</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>Spend too much time thinking, miss my chances</em>.</p>\\n<p>She was watching, apparently secure in the idea that she\\u2019d spot me or confirm my location if I made a break for it.\\xa0 I needed to disrupt that security.</p>\\n<p><em>Need to make a noise someplace I\\u2019m not.</em></p>\\n<p>I looked, peering into the windows, searching the classrooms around me.</p>\\n<p>Books could be slid across the floor.\\xa0 A small object could be thrown to break something, but both were crude, obvious.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t strong enough to throw or slide either all that far, the sliding book would make too much noise and the broken glass would be too cliche.</p>\\n<p>My eye settled on a shape at the back of one room, barely visible as a silhouette against the vague light that made it in from outside, even against the paler background of the wall.</p>\\n<p>I darted across the hall, low enough to the ground that I had to put my hand down to touch the floor for balance and to keep my nose from smashing into the tile.</p>\\n<p>My heartbeat picked up as I made it into the classroom, moving amid desks and chairs.\\xa0 There were windows, yes, but the only exit that didn\\u2019t threaten to cut me to shreds on the way through was the door I\\u2019d just passed through.\\xa0 If Mary appeared in the doorway, I might well be done for.\\xa0 Even if I did make it through a window, I wasn\\u2019t sure she couldn\\u2019t catch up to me.</p>\\n<p>The only defense was to do it fast and do it quiet.</p>\\n<p>I headed to the corner of the room furthest from the door.</p>\\n<p>Teacher\\u2019s desk.\\xa0 Nothing of importance.</p>\\n<p>But beside the teacher\\u2019s desk, next to the window, there was a <em>globe, </em>resting on a stand, fixed in place at the poles so it could spin.\\xa0 The colors were rich, even in the gloom.\\xa0 A third of the globe was dominated by a rich crimson, each etching of place name topped by a crown.\\xa0 The independent countries were marked out in their own colors, paler, less saturated, scattered and patchwork.<em><br/>\\n</em></p>\\n<p>I took it down and pried it free of the stand with the letter opener, then made my way back to the door.</p>\\n<p>I was paranoid enough of emerging to find Mary standing just outside the door that I raised the globe a bit to shield myself from an impending stab or pistol shot.</p>\\n<p>But she wasn\\u2019t there.</p>\\n<p>I glanced down the length of the hallway, then set the globe rolling in the direction of a door that sat slightly ajar, leading to a more distant classroom.</p>\\n<p>I watched it roll, glancing back periodically to make sure she wasn\\u2019t sneaking up on me.</p>\\n<p>It touched the door.\\xa0 The door moved, creaking slightly, clicking.</p>\\n<p>I ducked back to cover, hiding just inside a classroom, between the door and the shelf.</p>\\n<p>Closing my eyes, straining my ears, I counted to twenty.</p>\\n<p>When the time was up, I took a peek around the corner.</p>\\n<p>The globe had moved.</p>\\n<p>I moved in that same heartbeat, toward the globe, low enough to the ground that I couldn\\u2019t be glimpsed through the windows, glad for once that I hadn\\u2019t grown since I was nine.</p>\\n<p>As much as I was trying to find her and identify her location, she\\u2019d been doing much the same as I had.\\xa0 I had little doubt she\\u2019d watched me break into the school from a window, tracked my general location, maybe even spotted me as I made my way through the school itself.</p>\\n<p>She had made a sound, but I\\u2019d been able to afford staying still.\\xa0 Not a good thing, not entirely safe, if it was a precursor to her coming after me, but the ball was more in my court.</p>\\n<p><em>I\\u2019d</em> made a sound, it forced her to react.\\xa0 Staying where she was risked that I\\u2019d go after her \\u2018brothers\\u2019.\\xa0 Or that I might loop around and find another angle to use in going after the puppeteer.\\xa0 Or <em>anything</em>.</p>\\n<p>But seeing the globe, knowing it was a ruse, it forced a decision.\\xa0 She had to figure out where I <em>really</em> was.\\xa0 Was it a ruse, or was I leading her one way while slipping through to go after the puppeteer?</p>\\n<p>Given a fifty-fifty chance with no clue otherwise, the strings pulled her back to the puppeteer.</p>\\n<p>I passed the globe and the door it had touched, and felt a cool draft.\\xa0 The excuse for the globe\\u2019s movement.\\xa0 She\\u2019d slipped in through the window, had used it to make her exit, or both.</p>\\n<p>I rounded the corner to the west side of the school, moving as fast as I could toward the dormitories and the Lambsbridge gang.</p>\\n<p>Even just <em>approaching</em> the boy\\u2019s dormitory, I could smell the sickness.\\xa0 Over a thousand students periodically venting fluids out of every orifice.\\xa0 Looking through windows, across the corner of the yard, I could see that many lights were on in hallways, though not necessarily in the rooms themselves.\\xa0 Staff doing patrols and making sure the students were alright.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t quite see with the trees in the corner of the yard, but I saw motion.\\xa0 <em>Fast</em> motion.</p>\\n<p>The other Lambsbridge members.\\xa0 Running away or giving chase?</p>\\n<p>I only had a half-second to make the call, picking up speed, making noise as I ran.\\xa0 A glimpse through two sets of rain-covered windows, past branches and leaves.</p>\\n<p>I saw Helen\\u2019s eyes, and I saw Gordon\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>The focus, the killer instinct.</p>\\n<p>I picked up speed, running faster.\\xa0 My feet were bare and wet, partially from water that had dripped off the rest of me, and the tile was slick.\\xa0 I managed to keep my footing, but there were one or two points where I wondered if I was going to slip.\\xa0 Approaching the bend, where my hallway met theirs at the corner of the dormitory, I could hear them.</p>\\n<p>As we intersected, I spotted the smallest of Mary\\u2019s \\u2018brothers\\u2019, eight or so years old, with two knives in hand.\\xa0 Red haired, flushed in the face, but with a very cold look in his eyes.\\xa0 Those same eyes widened as I sprinted his way.</p>\\n<p><em>Surprise.</em></p>\\n<p>Almost unconsciously, he switched his grip on one knife around, so the blade pointed <em>down</em>.</p>\\n<p>I dropped to the floor.\\xa0 Still soaked with the rain, I slid on the tile.</p>\\n<p>He leaped, to avoid tripping on me, and I grabbed one foot.\\xa0 It slipped from my grasp, but I\\u2019d put him off balance.\\xa0 He flopped over, belly hitting the floor.</p>\\n<p>Spry little bastard.\\xa0 He was already on his feet when Gordon caught up with him.\\xa0 Without slowing, Gordon slapped one knife-hand to the side, caught the other wrist, and slammed the kid into a wall.</p>\\n<p>The kid went limp.\\xa0 Gordon held his wrist, letting him dangle.</p>\\n<p>The kid\\u2019s eyes opened, and he jerked his other knife hand, pointed at Gordon\\u2019s middle.\\xa0 Helen\\u2019s foot went out, pinning it against the wall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamn,\\u201d the kid said.\\xa0 I thought I might have seen a glimmer of fear in his eyes, but Gordon hauled him away from the wall, then cracked the kid\\u2019s head against it, hard.\\xa0 He paused, watching, then did it again.</p>\\n<p>The knives fell from the boy\\u2019s hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian, got something to put him under, just in case?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian did.\\xa0 She hurried forward, pulling her bag around in front of her to retrieve a syringe.\\xa0 She squirted out almost half of it before jamming it into the boy\\u2019s stomach, depressing it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo interrogation?\\u201d I asked, as I picked myself up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is the second we caught up to,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cFirst was uncooperative enough that I don\\u2019t think Gordon is willing to entertain this one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>As if to explain, Gordon turned and lifted up his shirt.\\xa0 A bandage was already showing some blood.</p>\\n<p>Helen and Gordon let the tyke drop to the floor.\\xa0 Gordon collected the knives, offered one to Helen, who shook her head, then stuck both into his belt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re better than I am,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAt?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cFighting?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shrugged one shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t say that.\\xa0 Using a knife?\\xa0 Throwing something?\\xa0 Definitely better.\\xa0 <em>Fighting</em>?\\xa0 Eh.\\xa0 <em>Brawling</em>?\\xa0 Definitely not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo real-world knowledge,\\u201d Jamie said, looking down at the boy.\\xa0 He looked up at Gordon.\\xa0 \\u201cNo visiting seedy parts of town to trade money or drink for some lessons from the meanest guys around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut they\\u2019re still really, really good,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He looked at me.\\xa0 \\u201cHow\\u2019d it go?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMr. Percy, our puppeteer, uses sounds to make them compliant if they get antsy,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s here, with Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPercy,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He paused to consider, then nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAttended the academy without being a student.\\xa0 He knows of the Lambsbridge project, but doesn\\u2019t know the particulars.\\xa0 Still no idea on greater motivation or plans.\\xa0 He\\u2019s hurt, getting medical care.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHurt?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrick smashed him in the face out of nowhere,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Puzzling.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon was on one knee, searching the little kid.\\xa0 He collected four knives and a small sack with a weight inside, which he examined.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBlackjack?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He tossed it to me.</p>\\n<p>I gave it a look-see, then pocketed it.\\xa0 \\u201cOur headmistress got a letter in her office, recommending that she call the Academy, discreetly, to ask for a thorough search and examination of the student body, keep everything locked down.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t expect her to be up and about this early, but it works.\\xa0 Puppeteer is here, kids are here.\\xa0 The noose is in place.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey only need a push, then,\\u201d Helen murmured.</p>\\n<p>I matched her flat stare with a grin.\\xa0 \\u201cI love you, big sister.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her expression unchanged, she reached over to rap the top of my head with her knuckles.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOw.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon tied the kid\\u2019s wrists and ankles, then hefted him, folded over one shoulder.\\xa0 Gordon was big for his age, the kid was small, but Gordon made it look effortless, which was something else altogether.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich way?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary was that way,\\u201d I said, pointing down the way I\\u2019d come.\\xa0 \\u201cPuppeteer is in or near the front office.\\xa0 The third boy is\\u2026 up to you to figure out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cLast we saw, he was near the kitchen, sent this one after us, we were busy staying out of the way while the little one used all his bullets trying to gun us down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe others had guns?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Have</em>,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe oldest one has a gun, still.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Gordon started walking, and the rest of us fell into an easy formation around him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm, have to backtrack a bit, but I wasn\\u2019t keeping up with the discussion,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou said the quarantine was arranged.\\xa0 They\\u2019re searching the <em>entire</em> student body?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUs included?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIdeal world, we won\\u2019t be here,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cEven if we are, we can adapt.\\xa0 But I wanted to pressure them, and this does that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not good at adapting,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cLess than you three, anyway.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSly is right, though.\\xa0 The pressure we\\u2019re putting on them is a good thing,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>That said</em>, the ten year old very nearly killed me, this one was hard enough to keep from slipping away, let alone <em>catch.\\xa0 </em>Helen wouldn\\u2019t put up a fight, and you, Jamie or Lil would die in two seconds flat if any of them got within arm\\u2019s length of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We were making our way past the kitchen.\\xa0 The smell of vomit was thicker here, not just because we were close to the place the poison had first taken hold, but because we were between both dormitories.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hate it when people call me Lil,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>I made a mental note of that, storing it for future use.</p>\\n<p>Gordon did the opposite and apologized, \\u201cSorry, Lillian.\\xa0 What are we thinking we do with the oldest clone, Mary, and the puppeteer?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeparate them, pick them off one by one,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary is <em>devoted</em> to her creator,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd the last one-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe teenager,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cOldest of the clones.\\xa0 Physically the strongest, presumably the most trained.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have eyes on that one?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ve glimpsed him, but he was leading this trio.\\xa0 Keeping his distance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I chewed on my bottom lip for a second.\\xa0 \\u201cDoesn\\u2019t work.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t see it.\\xa0 They\\u2019re going to band together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI agree,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m betting he knows his fellows are down, or he will when we turn up.\\xa0 He\\u2019ll stick with Mary, and both of them will stick with their puppeteer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrothers,\\u201d I murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re Mary\\u2019s \\u2018brothers\\u2019, to Mary and the Puppeteer.\\xa0 Mary is their sister.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a little family unit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI notice you called Helen a sister,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cInteresting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne isn\\u2019t related to the other,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI seem to recall you going on at length about the intricacies of the human mind,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cEverything impacts it on some level or something like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhatever.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s joke around about Sy really wanting a family, deep down inside.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s situation has made me realize it\\u2019s what I really want.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a <em>yearning</em> even.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hands settled on my shoulder.\\xa0 Prey instinct, <em>wham</em>.\\xa0 It took me a moment to realize it was because I saw Gordon, Jamie, Lil, and the smallest clone, but I didn\\u2019t see Helen.</p>\\n<p>Her arms wrapped around my shoulders from behind, and she hugged me tight, before leaning forward to give me a peck on the cheek.\\xa0 Too perfunctory to be anything serious.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t move a muscle.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be your big sister if that\\u2019s what you really want,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSarcasm,\\u201d I said, still not moving.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure what we are, but I don\\u2019t think \\u2018family\\u2019 is exactly it, and I\\u2019m really truly okay with that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She pulled away, giving me a rap on the head as she stepped over to Gordon\\u2019s side.\\xa0 I caught a glimpse of a wry smile on her face as she gave me a sidelong glance.\\xa0 For my benefit.\\xa0 Her way of letting me know she\\u2019d been joking too.</p>\\n<p>Geez.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re the Lambsbridge orphans,\\u201d Gordon said, as Helen leaned against the wall beside him, raising her hand to fix the placement of a strand of hair.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s all we need to be.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut,\\u201d Jamie cut in, \\u201cpart of being the Lambsbridge Orphans is doing our job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich brings us back to the \\u2018how\\u2019,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou guys think you can hold your own and keep one of them busy while I confront the other?\\xa0 I\\u2019m not sure I can take the older one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t have to \\u2018win\\u2019.\\xa0 Assuming the headmistress reached out to the Academy, which I <em>do </em>assume, it\\u2019s all a matter of time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat if you\\u2019re wrong?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m never wrong,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The sudden burst of protest that came from every corner and every mouth overlapped to the point that I couldn\\u2019t pick out individual words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoint-\\u201d I started.\\xa0 I was talked over.</p>\\n<p>I rolled my eyes.\\xa0 I was pretty sure at least half of them were doing it to try to be funny.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoint taken,\\u201d I managed.</p>\\n<p>They stopped.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGet it all out of your system?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s late, our sleep was interrupted, we\\u2019ve been on edge all week,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThanks for that.\\xa0 The laugh helped.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stuck my tongue out at him.</p>\\n<p>I studied them.\\xa0 Most were in uniforms, though Jamie was wearing pyjamas with shoes, an odd combination.\\xa0 He\\u2019d left our room too quickly to get dressed first.\\xa0 I\\u2019d never changed into my pyjamas, myself.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was hurt, and it showed a little in how he held himself and his expression, and Helen was a little rumpled, though unharmed.\\xa0 Lil, oddly enough, seemed more together and comfortable than I\\u2019d seen her in a long time.\\xa0 Maybe ever.</p>\\n<p>She saw me looking and hugged her bag of medical stuff to her chest, glaring at me over the top of it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re home,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t move, but the glare became a more perplexed expression.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis.\\xa0 It\\u2019s where you belong.\\xa0 Or the Academy is, and this is a close second.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t reply immediately.\\xa0 Her eyes moved, taking in the surroundings.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry we\\u2019re not sticking around for longer,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m okay being anywhere I don\\u2019t have to worry about getting poisoned or stabbed,\\u201d Lil said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust an hour or two more,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf Sy\\u2019s not wrong about the quarantine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrapping ourselves in here with skilled murderers,\\u201d Jamie said, \\u201cWhat could go wrong?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCorner the rats and hope they don\\u2019t bite too hard,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpeaking of,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 His voice had dropped, which helped complete the thought.</p>\\n<p>We were further from the more lit dorms, now.\\xa0 In less secure territory.\\xa0 If we made it around to the front office, I would be very close to having completed a full circuit around the building.</p>\\n<p>The conversation was, I supposed, our way of touching base, leveling each other out, propping each other up.\\xa0 Helen was being selective in what she said, letting me know she was glad to have me back in her peculiar way, but she didn\\u2019t need reassurance in the same way.</p>\\n<p>The attitudes of the individual members of the group changed as the surroundings did.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe got the last two by moving around as a group,\\u201d Gordon murmured.\\xa0 His voice was lowered so he wouldn\\u2019t give us away.\\xa0 \\u201cThey were trying to keep us away from any place we could arm ourselves or hole ourselves up.\\xa0 Cornered the first one in the kitchen.\\xa0 Second one was faking sick.\\xa0 Jamie figured him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re going to be ready for us to come as a group,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe may not be able to keep them from running if they want to run, even if they don\\u2019t have a trap.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I exaggerated my nods until I lost my balance, and bumped into him.\\xa0 He elbowed me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is serious.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t get shot,\\u201d I said, echoing Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201cGive me a chance to talk to them.\\xa0 Mary is off-balance enough I think I can get to her on a level.\\xa0 She\\u2019s pissed because I threw a brick at the man who brought her into this world.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s harder if they\\u2019re all together,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know how up to talking the puppeteer is,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAgain, brick to face.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou keep saying that like you\\u2019re proud,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was a beautiful throw.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo you <em>are</em> proud,\\u201d Jamie said, voice quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I breathed the word.\\xa0 \\u201cGordon couldn\\u2019t have done better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re the filthiest liar,\\u201d Gordon murmured, smirking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan we stop talking?\\u201d Lil asked.</p>\\n<p>We obeyed.</p>\\n<p>The hallway turned, and we came face to face with a scattered group of youths.</p>\\n<p>Gordon drew a knife, but Helen\\u2019s hand reached out, stopping him from going any further.</p>\\n<p>They were ordinary kids.\\xa0 Miserable kids in pyjamas who looked like they\\u2019d died and been brought back as stitched.\\xa0 These would be the especially sick ones who needed help, ones who, if the metallic smell to the bodily fluids was any indication, had been so violently ill that blood was involved.</p>\\n<p>We were near the infirmary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNext door on the right,\\u201d Jamie murmured.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave him a tight nod.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Helen edged closer to the door, while I ducked low, to peek past their knees.</p>\\n<p>Mary, unarmed, standing in the middle of the brightly lit room, ribbons removed, hair in relative disarray.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was fastest to grasp that something was wrong.\\xa0 He shoved Helen backward, and Jamie caught her.\\xa0 I reacted too, backing away, not entirely sure why until Gordon turned the other way.</p>\\n<p>The room opposite.</p>\\n<p>A pistol went off, the bullet striking the doorframe where Gordon\\u2019s head had been.\\xa0 It was almost too loud in the hallway where there was nothing to absorb the sound, the sound bouncing off the walls, an echo that played off the ringing in my ears.</p>\\n<p>The sick children around us screamed, panicking.\\xa0 They leaped up from chairs and the floor of the hallway.</p>\\n<p>The screams continued as the children got in our way and obstructed our movements.\\xa0 One tried to hide between me, clutching the back of my shirt, and made it hard for me to rise to a proper standing position.</p>\\n<p>It was a moment of stupidity that left me mostly in the front of everything as our third boy stepped out of the room he\\u2019d been hiding in, pistol in hand.\\xa0 He wore a uniform, but he had a cloak and hood on over it, possibly to conceal himself better in the dark.</p>\\n<p>For all my talk about effective use and prediction of bugs\\u2019 movements when the box was shaken\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOy!\\u201d Gordon shouted.\\xa0 \\u201cGot your kid brother here!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw the hesitation.\\xa0 The pistol\\u2019s barrel slid away from me as his focus turned to Gordon and the youngest clone.</p>\\n<p>I started to move, ready to kick up and try to knock it away or out of his hand, but the kid behind me still clung to me, and I immediately knew I wouldn\\u2019t make contact.</p>\\n<p>For an instant, I thought we hadn\\u2019t accounted for all the clones, but then he made a small sound of fear.\\xa0 Human frailty, not maliciousness.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was heading for cover, still carrying his burden, turning his body and running almost sideways so the littlest clone was more between him and the gun-wielder.\\xa0 The gun moved, wholly focused on Gordon.</p>\\n<p>One shot rang out, and the clone moved to reload.</p>\\n<p><em>Did Mary warn him that I\\u2019d said Gordon was most dangerous?</em></p>\\n<p>I made my escape, grabbing the kid who\\u2019d clutched me and dragging him behind, even though it slowed me down.</p>\\n<p>The third shot was aimed at me.\\xa0 It hit the same boy I was trying to rescue, leaving me to stumble as my grip broke.</p>\\n<p>Helen grabbed me and pulled me around the corner.\\xa0 We were right at the bend in the hallway where the hallway at the southern part of the school met the long hallway from the eastern part.</p>\\n<p>The commotion broke up.\\xa0 The children who\\u2019d been sitting there waiting for their turns in the infirmary had mostly fled.\\xa0 Two were apparently too sick to move while bullets were flying, and the third lay there with a bullet hole in him.\\xa0 The one who\\u2019d clutched me.\\xa0 Younger than I\\u2019d expected, going only by the strength of his grip.</p>\\n<p>I exhaled slowly.\\xa0 Gordon was across the hall, in a classroom, ass on the ground, back to the wall, the littlest clone propped up beside him, still unconscious.\\xa0 The others were behind me.</p>\\n<p>Unconscious and whatever else.\\xa0 Being knocked out didn\\u2019t mean waking up <em>okay</em> after a set amount of time.\\xa0 It could mean serious brain injuries.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have to ask, for context,\\u201d I started.</p>\\n<p>The pistol fired yet again.\\xa0 I saw the puff where it had hit the corner.</p>\\n<p>It was a ball pistol.\\xa0 One shot, firing balls of lead or whatever else.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t efficient, in terms of the number of bullets it spat out, range, velocity, or whatever else.\\xa0 Where a bullet from a high-end gun passed through your enemy, <em>these</em> guns were meant to fire a small metal sphere into the other guy\\u2019s body, where it could bounce around and tear up their insides.\\xa0 A good killer would make the bullet count, and the damage done by these particular weapons meant that Academy trained doctors would have a far harder time patching them up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cContext,\\u201d I started again.\\xa0 \\u201cDoes the Puppeteer read you bedtime stories at night?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I heard Mary speak, and she sounded very tired.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t answer.\\xa0 He\\u2019s trying to get to us, or trying to buy time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, Mary!\\xa0 How are you doing?\\u201d I called out.\\xa0 \\u201cThey really like using you as bait, don\\u2019t they?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI volunteered,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy plan.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFunny how that works,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019d think the puppeteer would work harder to convince you that you should stay alive, if you\\u2019re that special to him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPuppeteer?\\u201d the older clone asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t listen to him,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>You</em> responded,\\u201d he pointed out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I could imagine her expression.\\xa0 Not very happy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m curious, Mary, why did you change your mind?\\xa0 You sounded so insistent about not wanting the puppeteer to put himself in danger by coming here.\\xa0 Then he said his magic words and, well, can you clarify?\\xa0 It doesn\\u2019t make sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMagic words,\\u201d she said, her voice soft.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re special, Mary, he was going to make something of you, right?\\xa0 Big sister to all the new clones of the next generation.\\xa0 Why would he do that, trying to control you?\\xa0 Maybe if he came out, I could hear his explanation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s-\\u201d the older clone started.\\xa0 He stopped short.</p>\\n<p>I frowned, staring down at the ground, trying to picture <em>why</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to put him in harm\\u2019s way,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ll have to get through us to get to him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBasically what I was going to say,\\u201d the older clone said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe puts <em>you</em> in harm\\u2019s way,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat part of this is fair?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s none of your business,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s <em>exactly</em> our business!\\xa0 It\\u2019s what we do.\\xa0 We do it to make money.\\xa0 The <em>definition</em> of business.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t see either of them.\\xa0 I was talking to thin air, which was <em>worse</em> than it had been trying to talk to Mary in the furnace room.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re the cleanup crew for a corrupt and distorted organization.\\xa0 Child soldiers and killers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think any argument you could make against our group would apply double for your puppeteer,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThink so?\\xa0 You don\\u2019t know us,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Something was off.</p>\\n<p>For someone recommending <em>avoiding</em> talking to me, she was doing an awful lot of it.</p>\\n<p>I raised a finger, pointing at the corner of the wall.\\xa0 Very slowly, I moved my fingertip.\\xa0 I glanced back at Jamie and Helen, then over to Gordon.</p>\\n<p>I got nods in response.\\xa0 They got it.\\xa0 Gordon leaned back, out of sight.</p>\\n<p>Mary was distracting us while the other clone approached down the length of the hall.</p>\\n<p>We didn\\u2019t have guns.\\xa0 Much less guns intended to rip someone up inside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know you, Mary,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI get you.\\xa0 We\\u2019re the <em>same.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She faked a laugh.</p>\\n<p>I held the blackjack and letter opener, poised to throw the first and stab with the second.\\xa0 The other clone had to be close.\\xa0 He could well have his back to the same corner I was crouched beside.\\xa0 Close enough to smell, if the smell of blood and puke hadn\\u2019t made the use of my nose impossible.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLaughing, you don\\u2019t see it?\\xa0 Tell me, did you have breakfast with him, Mary?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOften enough?\\xa0 In the way you really <em>wanted</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A pause.</p>\\n<p>Glass shattered.</p>\\n<p>That was my cue.\\xa0 I threw myself forward, out into the hallway.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was still mid-air, having leaped through one of the tree-branch and broken-glass windows that separated classrooms from the hall.\\xa0 Glass and bits of wood danced around him, his knees pulled up to his chest to clear the wall beneath the window.</p>\\n<p>Not anything I\\u2019d expected, but it was <em>something.</em></p>\\n<p>My shoulder hit the ground.\\xa0 I\\u2019d planned to stab if he was close enough.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t, so I threw the blackjack.\\xa0 A little weight in a long, semi-rigid bag for smacking someone over the head.\\xa0 It served as something to distract, to buy Gordon a fifth of a second as our teenaged assailant reacted.</p>\\n<p>Gordon collided with him.\\xa0 In the midst of the collision I saw the <em>two</em> pistols the eldest clone was armed with, saw Gordon reach for just the one, twisting it around in the clone\\u2019s hand so the barrel pointed at the boy, the trigger finger slipping away from the trigger.</p>\\n<p>Our Gordon.\\xa0 A hero on paper, skilled, strong, fit.\\xa0 But if anyone took him for noble, they\\u2019d be wrong.\\xa0 A noble person didn\\u2019t take advantage of inches of height difference to slam their forehead into someone\\u2019s mouth.</p>\\n<p>The older clone shoved Gordon away.\\xa0 He raised his pistol in the same instant Gordon did.\\xa0 One aimed at the other.</p>\\n<p>Slowly, I found my feet, rising beside Gordon.</p>\\n<p>The glass had cut him on the way through.\\xa0 That didn\\u2019t happen in the books.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou had two guns,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas going to shoot both ways,\\u201d the clone replied.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not here for you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re here for the puppeteer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not his name,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a good enough name,\\u201d I joined in.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t deny he has control over you.\\xa0 He pulls your strings, he decides what you do.\\xa0 Uses you as bait.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd <em>they</em> don\\u2019t use you?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re not tied to them, these other orphans?\\xa0 Would you give them up to save your skin?\\xa0 Oh, wait, you don\\u2019t care about your skin.\\xa0 Expiration dates, huh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw Gordon\\u2019s gun waver a fraction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, you forgot to tell them, huh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas going to at the conclusion of this,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou described yourself as a villain.\\xa0 You\\u2019re a liar, a cheat, a thief, a grubby killer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYet,\\u201d Gordon chimed in, \\u201cI believe him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary didn\\u2019t have a quick response for that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen I was asking about breakfast, about the little things that count,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI was really asking if you felt <em>loved</em>, if you truly loved your\\u2026 father, or whatever you see him as, or if it\\u2019s just something ingrained in you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think that\\u2019s my cue?\\u201d a voice said.\\xa0 Not a confident one.</p>\\n<p>A <em>female</em> voice.</p>\\n<p>The headmistress emerged behind Mary.</p>\\n<p>Her hands clutched a piece of paper.</p>\\n<p>My thoughts moved so fast that they were a jumble.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLa, re, tu, la, sun-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I found my conclusion.</p>\\n<p>Left alone with the headmistress, the quarantine, our puppeteer had figured out what I\\u2019d done.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey are not on your side!\\u201d\\xa0 I called out.\\xa0 \\u201cThey are not with the Academy, Headmistress!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d turned it around.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-ro, ta.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The eldest clone reacted, pulling the trigger.\\xa0 Gordon\\u2019s reaction was a fraction of a second later, off-balance as he reeled from getting hit.\\xa0 The clone was hit in the shoulder.</p>\\n<p>The look in his eyes went beyond cold, and had become something else entirely.\\xa0 Dead, empty, hollowed out.</p>\\n<p>That was how he had them kill the parents.\\xa0 A kill phrase, a letter they were to read at a set time or something sent to the home.</p>\\n<p>Gordon fell, and the clone barely staggered, heedless of pain and injury.</p>\\n<p>Helen wasn\\u2019t a fighter, and the rest of us didn\\u2019t stand a chance.</p>\\n<p>The puppeteer was a manipulative bastard, one that could well be on his way out, and he might well have beat us with one fell stroke.</p>\\n<p><a

low, make better use of shorter stature-</em></p>\\n<p>The eldest boy stepped closer.\\xa0 I ducked, drawing my arm back to stab, and he kicked me.\\xa0 He caught and twisted my wrist while I was trying to catch my balance and before I grasped what he was doing, he\\u2019d grabbed the letter opener.</p>\\n<p>He pushed, and with the way my arm was twisted around, my head pointing <em>forward</em> rather than <em>up, </em>I was put in the position of having to let him destroy the arm or letting myself fall.</p>\\n<p>I toppled, landing next to Gordon.\\xa0 He was hunched over, his hand to his chest.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t like the amount of blood I saw.</p>\\n<p>Mary was standing back, between me and the Headmistress, who was kneeling on the ground, trying to help the little boy who had been shot, her eyes wide, paper in one hand.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s expression was unreadable, but her body was tense enough I could visualize every muscle being tight, ready to spring.\\xa0 The headmistress was the opposite, as if she would have fallen to pieces with a touch.</p>\\n<p>The others were still around the corner, half-crouching, caught between running and trying to do something.</p>\\n<p>Helen was the one who stepped up.</p>\\n<p><em>We\\u2019re better as a group.\\xa0 Just need to put him off balance, give Helen the best opportunity possible</em>.</p>\\n<p>I found my feet, half-walking, half-stumbling over to Gordon, where I grabbed one of the knives he\\u2019d stowed in his belt.\\xa0 I paused, behind the clone, watching, waiting for the best chance.</p>\\n<p>He reached forward, to his belt.</p>\\n<p>Helen took a step, and I lunged in the same instant.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBehind you!\\u201d Mary called out.</p>\\n<p>My instincts told me that Helen saw me, that she was capitalizing on the eldest clone\\u2019s distraction and my position.\\xa0 Together, the pair of us might be able to accomplish something, whether he was drawing\\xa0 a knife or loading his pistol.</p>\\n<p>But Helen stepped back, instead.</p>\\n<p>I found myself on a collision course with someone almost twice my size, who was better armed than I was, far better trained.\\xa0 He followed Mary\\u2019s warning by turning and spotting me.</p>\\n<p>Situations like this were where I felt like the Academy had screwed me over.\\xa0 The thoughts were in place, I knew what I had to do, and I could see everything play out.\\xa0 Knife in hand, my enemy\\u2019s soft gut in plain view, almost in reach, nothing to stop the knife from punching deep.\\xa0 Let the pain and the damage done slow him down.</p>\\n<p>But thoughts ran away, I started naturally thinking about cause and effect, follow-up, what to do to maximize the damage done and turn the situation around.\\xa0 What if he made that one in a million movement to knock my knife aside with the letter opener or the barrel of the one-shot pistol?</p>\\n<p>While talking it wasn\\u2019t a problem, I could say one thing while thinking about the next step.\\xa0 A fight moved too fast.\\xa0\\xa0It slowed me down, made it feel like my hands and body were a step behind my thoughts.\\xa0 Enough to make the difference in a fight against someone ordinary.</p>\\n<p>This guy wasn\\u2019t ordinary.\\xa0 He swept his arm out, holding the pistol high \\u2013<em>more thoughts about complications, predicting what he was doing, countering it</em>\\u2013 and letting his cloak fan out.\\xa0 The fabric of the raincloak caught the knife.\\xa0 His arm moved and helped the cloak naturally fold around the knife and my knife hand.\\xa0 He bent his arm and used his elbow to force both hand and weapon to one side.</p>\\n<p>Before I could try to pull away, he was twisting, bringing his knee into my hand, driving it into the wall.</p>\\n<p>I grimaced in pain and followed through on backing up, aware that I\\u2019d lost my knife in the tangle of his cloak.</p>\\n<p>The letter opener clinked to the ground as he straightened his arm, fixing the flow of his cloak so his own limb wasn\\u2019t trapped in the folds.</p>\\n<p>Before I could catch my balance and pull my thoughts together, he was leaning forward, chasing me faster than I was retreating.\\xa0 My knife was in one of his hands, freed from the cloak, filling the hand the letter opener had just been dropped from.\\xa0 The pistol was in his other hand.</p>\\n<p><em>Good job, Sy.\\xa0 Pick a fight, achieve nothing except arming the other guy with successively larger weapons.\\xa0 Shall we go find a sword to give him?<br/>\\n</em></p>\\n<p>He kicked me, hard, and sent me stumbling backward.\\xa0 Keeping me off balance.</p>\\n<p>I was in the middle of thinking about how to regain it and turn things around when I stumbled over Gordon.\\xa0 I hit the ground, the back of my head cracking hard against the floor.</p>\\n<p><em>One of the best minds the Academy can produce, still no better in a fight than a typical underweight, underdeveloped eleven year old.</em></p>\\n<p>I felt a little better knowing that Gordon was now between me and the clone, even if he was crawling on the floor, one hand held tight against a bullet wound, my feet on his back while I lay on the floor.</p>\\n<p>Then I felt guilty for feeling better.</p>\\n<p>I shot a quick glance at Mary and the headmistress, and saw that Mary was on the approach.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d I said, backing away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t even try,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you want this?\\xa0 Do you want to be-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was cut off by the slam of a door.\\xa0 The eldest clone had kicked a door that Jamie was trying to use as a shield.\\xa0 The door closed, and Jamie, Lil and Helen backed up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you want to be <em>that</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her expression was still blank, unreadable.</p>\\n<p>I knew she had emotions.\\xa0 I\\u2019d seen them, or I\\u2019d seen hints of them.\\xa0 The problem was that she only let herself be vulnerable with her creator.\\xa0 The same man that had turned his back on her.</p>\\n<p>She lifted up her skirt at one side and slipped a knife free from a garter.</p>\\n<p>Gordon moved, straightening, and my feet slid off his back to drop onto the back of his legs.\\xa0 I pulled them out of the way as he got one foot under him and started to rise up to a standing position.</p>\\n<p>Mary, for her part, backed off.\\xa0 Her hand moved at the side of her skirt, and she held another knife.\\xa0 Smaller, less fancy, and probably weighted for throwing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d I warned.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t seem to notice, and he didn\\u2019t seem to notice Mary either.\\xa0 He headed for the older clone.</p>\\n<p>Mary threw, and in that moment, Gordon stopped in his tracks.\\xa0 The knife carried onward, striking the wall.\\xa0 Gordon barely spared Mary a glance before grabbing the knife from the wall and throwing it at the other clone\\u2019s back.</p>\\n<p>The teenaged clone stumbled.\\xa0 Helen started to move toward him, but he held up his knives, warning her off.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, for his part, made it another two steps before something refused to support him.\\xa0 His upper body went askew, seemingly twisted more by pain than anything else, and he stumbled into the wall.\\xa0 I saw him look at the others, then Mary, then me, a measured study, taking it all in.\\xa0 His eyes lingered on mine.</p>\\n<p><em>One of the first lessons students learn in the Academy, is that life wants to survive</em>.\\xa0 <em>We\\u2019ve been at the survival game for a terribly, terribly long time.\\xa0 Against hostile environments, against predators.\\xa0 So long as a student doesn\\u2019t work against that impulse, either on the fundamental level or while dealing with the individual, they can trust that life will find a way</em>.</p>\\n<p>Meeting Gordon\\u2019s gaze, I was shocked to see just how hard walking that <em>way</em> was.\\xa0 His eyes had dark shadows under them as if he hadn\\u2019t slept in a week, and his skin was pale, his pupils narrowed.\\xa0 Each breath he took was laborious, the sort of ragged hauls for breath I\\u2019d expect someone to take after being underwater for minutes, but they each came right on the back of the last, with a phlegmatic cast to it, prompting his entire body to jerk a little, as if something kept getting stuck and coming unstuck as he strained himself.<em><br/>\\n</em></p>\\n<p><em>Best of the best</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>I want to take your place, so you don\\u2019t have to do this</em>.</p>\\n<p>Gordon didn\\u2019t seem to be up to talking.\\xa0 He looked at Mary, who was reaching for another throwing weapon, and spread his arms to either side, stepping away from the wall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t,\\u201d I told Mary, which was the truth.\\xa0 Then I lied, \\u201cWhen he\\u2019s like this he\\u2019ll just catch them out of the air.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Though her expression was blank, I saw the pause in her follow-through.\\xa0 A moment of doubt.</p>\\n<p>Gordon pushed himself away from the wall, taking advantage of the bend in the hallway to escape Mary\\u2019s throwing range and advance on the clone he\\u2019d thrown a knife at.</p>\\n<p>I saw Mary grab the knife and hurried to duck into the classroom where the youngest clone had been propped up against a wall.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t throw the knife.</p>\\n<p>Gordon drew closer to the clone he\\u2019d knifed.\\xa0 Both were injured, Gordon suffering from a gunshot that had very possibly danced around the inside of his torso, the clone shot in one shoulder and knifed in the back.</p>\\n<p>The clone, however, seemed largely immune to pain, the killing phrase driving him past such mundane things, putting him in the mind for efficient aggression and murder and nothing else.\\xa0 He was using his wounded shoulder to a reasonable extent, a stark contrast to Gordon, who wasn\\u2019t using one arm while he held a hand against his injury, though both arms were in good working order.</p>\\n<p>Our clone had about three inches and twenty-five pounds on Gordon, who was already of a good size.</p>\\n<p>To top it off, it seemed he had a pistol and the wherewithal to use it.\\xa0 While Gordon limped his way, he drew a pellet out of his pocket and slipped it into the gun\\u2019s chamber, pulling at the lever along the barrel.</p>\\n<p>Helen appeared behind the clone, doing exactly what I\\u2019d intended when I\\u2019d come up behind him, earlier.\\xa0 She caught the clone\\u2019s arm as Gordon drew closer, hauling it back and forcing the pistol off course.\\xa0 I ducked lower in the wake of it going off, though I knew that by the time I heard the thing it was already too late.</p>\\n<p>I saw a flurry of movement as Helen scrabbled for a grip on him, only to get elbowed once, kicked, and slashed at by the knife.</p>\\n<p>Gordon collided with him, keeping him from doing anything further.</p>\\n<p><em>They\\u2019re still nascent</em>, I thought. Gordon was still undeveloped.\\xa0 Still young, largely untrained.\\xa0 Our exercises and adventures in the ass-end of Radham weren\\u2019t sanctioned, but weren\\u2019t discouraged either.\\xa0 Gordon had been <em>hungry</em> to put his brain to work, and he\\u2019d done it to good effect.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d been less hungry, more desperate, but my own studies at the back-alley brawl had been far less effective.\\xa0 I\\u2019d stuck it out for far too long before the others had stopped letting me come.</p>\\n<p>Gordon had put himself chest-to-chest with the clone.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t pretty, it wasn\\u2019t fancy.\\xa0 It was exactly what he needed to do to reduce the effectiveness of the skills the clones had learned in the ring.</p>\\n<p>This was how he operated, and this was how he thought.</p>\\n<p>The Academy hadn\\u2019t gone out of their way to make him especially tough, but they\\u2019d given him a good head and a good body and that counted for something.\\xa0 They had, however, equipped him so he would pick up the skills he needed and master them faster than most.\\xa0 Part of having a good head and a good body was that he had the coordination between both, no matter the situation, moving and thinking quickly with neither suffering for the other.</p>\\n<p>Knives were terrible weapons, and our two brawlers each had one.\\xa0 They were messy things, messier when the one wielding them was <em>good</em>, and both fighters here were good. Tentative slashes were fended off, hands of one boy gripping the wrists of the other, to try and limit the movement of the knives, but even the chance cuts were gruesome, parting skin. Blood dripped from Gordon\\u2019s chest wound to the floor now that he was no longer holding his hand there.</p>\\n<p>I yelped a little as I saw Gordon take a knife in the side.\\xa0 I saw him bring one arm down, away from the clone\\u2019s wrist, pinning the knife in place.\\xa0 With the slickness of the blood and Gordon\\u2019s sheer tenacity, the clone couldn\\u2019t pull it free.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, for his part, still practically hugging his enemy, was able to stab several times, despite the clone\\u2019s efforts to keep his arm still.</p>\\n<p><em>This is the puppeteer\\u2019s mistake.\\xa0 Take away something\\u2019s will to continue on, no matter how strong it is, no matter what else you do, you create a losing battle</em>.</p>\\n<p>The clone didn\\u2019t try to stop Gordon, instead striking out with hands, striking at head, ears, even at Gordon\\u2019s bullet wound.</p>\\n<p>But Gordon kept stabbing, and soon reached the point where the clone wasn\\u2019t resisting as the knife went in and out of his midsection.\\xa0 The clone soon dropped, and Gordon went with him, having been leaning so heavily on him for support.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and Lil went immediately to his side, looking after Gordon while dealing with the dying clone.\\xa0 Helen, badly cut, didn\\u2019t move from where she\\u2019d fallen, but a glance suggested Lil had given her some preliminary care.\\xa0 All three of them were around the corner from Mary and the headmistress.\\xa0 Joining them meant crossing the breadth of the hallway.\\xa0 I decided that wasn\\u2019t too wise.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t get a response.</p>\\n<p>I glanced out of the hallway, then pulled my head back as I saw a flurry of movement, out of the corner of my eye.\\xa0 A knife hit the doorframe.</p>\\n<p>I tried to grab it, found I didn\\u2019t have the strength to pull it away where it had embedded into the wood, removed my hand, and saw <em>another</em> hit the spot where my hand had just been.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s over, Mary,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat are you even doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m doing what the Academy needs me to do,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cProtecting the children of this school.\\xa0 I just\\u2026 I have to buy time and make sure you don\\u2019t get away, before the quarantine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you even talking about?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>I raised a hand, urging Jamie to hold back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cForget the headmistress.\\xa0 As pawns go, she\\u2019s mostly used up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPawn?\\u201d I heard the woman utter the word.\\xa0 Outrage had pushed her to speak where she\\u2019d been caught up in silent horror, watching children shoot, stab, and use weapons on each other, spattering her school hallway with blood.</p>\\n<p>I ignored her.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere do you go next, Mary?\\xa0 The puppeteer is gone.\\xa0 He left the headmistress with a paper that was supposed to turn you into weapons, presumably one by one.\\xa0 Something about that tells me he didn\\u2019t plot a way for you to meet again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll do what I\\u2019m supposed to do, and then I\\u2019ll find him,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, you want to prove your worth, after being discarded?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cProve that you worked as an experiment?\\xa0 He\\u2019ll be so overjoyed at how good you are that he takes you back in with open arms?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh come on, Mary,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cCome <em>on</em>.\\xa0 I bet I\\u2019m describing almost <em>exactly</em> what you\\u2019re hoping for.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t care about the <em>boys</em>, this kid who\\u2019s unconscious next to me, or the big guy that just got carved up by Gordon.\\xa0 You just figured you\\u2019d stand there and let them throw themselves at us, do as much damage as possible, and then you\\u2019d clean up.\\xa0 Go back to the puppeteer as the one who <em>succeeded</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There wasn\\u2019t a response.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThing about you being created for one thing and one thing only, you\\u2019re pretty easy to figure out.\\xa0 You have a reality and the puppeteer is at the center of it.\\xa0 You\\u2019re trying very hard to avoid thinking about what it means, that he went out of his way to plug a special sequence of sounds into your head, and set it up so that you\\u2019d <em>kill</em>.\\xa0 The lies, the basic underlying <em>thought process</em> that he had from the beginning.\\xa0 What he\\u2019s doing right this moment, leaving you\\u2026 and what lies in the future.\\xa0 Even in your perfect hypothetical world, what happens?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Still no response.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s say you kill each of us.\\xa0 Gordon\\u2019s dead, Helen can\\u2019t fight so effectively, Jamie\\u2019s almost as bad in a scrap as I am.\\xa0 Then you go to him, and he welcomes you with open arms.\\xa0 But you know he\\u2019ll have his doubts.\\xa0 He knows <em>you</em> know that he abandoned you.\\xa0 What you are.\\xa0 Can you picture the tense conversation, the rules he sets in place so you don\\u2019t go running the mouth and filling in the next generation of clones?\\xa0 How grim is that life, the two of you never speaking about what happened tonight, and how things changed?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was still silent.</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 Did I lose her?\\xa0 Had she slipped away?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe reality of existence, of <em>life</em>, in every sense of the word, Academy or literal or figurative, is that things change.\\xa0 Nothing is static.\\xa0 Your relationship to the puppeteer has changed, and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I chanced another look out into the hallway.</p>\\n<p>I thought I saw a movement, and flinched, ducking back.</p>\\n<p>When no knife appeared, I looked again.</p>\\n<p>There was only the headmistress, clutching her hands in front of her.\\xa0 I saw her eyes move.</p>\\n<p>To the broken window.\\xa0 After Gordon had come into the classroom with the littlest clone, he\\u2019d made a dramatic exit-</p>\\n<p>And Mary had made a silent entrance.</p>\\n<p>I scrambled to move out of the way.\\xa0 The knife that hit the door wasn\\u2019t a throwing weapon.\\xa0 Larger, burlier around the handle.\\xa0 She\\u2019d still managed to throw it hard enough and accurately enough that the blade stuck in the wood.</p>\\n<p>She came through the aisle of the dark classroom, ducking low, a weapon in each hand.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t need to see anything more.\\xa0 I escaped into the hallway.</p>\\n<p>Jamie\\u2019s eyes widened as he looked over my shoulder.</p>\\n<p>Before his mouth was even open, I was reacting to the warning he was about to communicate.\\xa0 No overthinking possible in this, at least.\\xa0 \\u2018Get out of the way\\u2019 was a \\u2018get out of the way\\u2019, and it didn\\u2019t need to be fancy.</p>\\n<p>I turned, and in the process I fell awkwardly against the corner where the two hallways met.</p>\\n<p>Mary stopped in the doorway, looking at all of us.\\xa0 She had one knife in hand.\\xa0 The other hand was empty, clenched.</p>\\n<p>Her facade was slipping.\\xa0 There was emotion in her eyes.\\xa0 Anger, hatred.</p>\\n<p>Many of us were beaten, battered, and bruised.\\xa0 Jamie and Lil had avoided more than a few simple scuffs, but Gordon, Helen and I had taken our individual beatings, roughly in that order.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t so sure we could put up a fight.\\xa0 Especially if she played it clever.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t say it,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p><em>Don\\u2019t say what?\\xa0 </em>I thought.\\xa0 My memory wasn\\u2019t that good, for me to know what she was referencing.</p>\\n<p>But whatever it was, it was something I\\u2019d said that had stuck with her, something she was afraid I\\u2019d say.</p>\\n<p>I offered her a sympathetic expression, while my brain raced to try and piece it together.</p>\\n<p>The sympathy hurt her.\\xa0 It made her fist clench tighter.\\xa0 <em>I\\u2019m pegging her wrong</em>, I realized.\\xa0 The anger, hatred, and fear all stemmed from something else, flowing from a source that ran deeper and left more painful wounds.</p>\\n<p><em>Need</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t say it, then,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cBut put the weapon down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing left for you here.\\xa0 If you hold on to it, whatever futures flow from there, they-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw her flinch.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026I said I wouldn\\u2019t say it,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you\\u2019re a villain,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cA liar.\\xa0 Just say it.\\xa0 Out with it.\\xa0 Say it, or I will.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlone,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you move forward, you\\u2019ll be alone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her head snapped to one side.\\xa0 I saw the pain in her expression.\\xa0 The facade was broken, the vulnerability exploited and trampled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHeadmistress,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p><em>Oh no.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cHeadmistress!\\u201d I called out.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, nope, don\\u2019t listen to her!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRead it,\\u201d Mary said, pointing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t!\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>I saw the indecision on the headmistress\\u2019 face.</p>\\n<p>In the midst of a situation she didn\\u2019t comprehend in the slightest, she held the means to turn Mary into the weapon, a mad, reckless one, but one we might not be able to properly fight.\\xa0 For Mary, though, it was an escape.</p>\\n<p>Something to take the <em>dissonance</em> and simplify it.\\xa0 Reduce everything to one basic, self-destructive impulse.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you don\\u2019t,\\u201d Mary said, \\u201cThey\\u2019ll kill us both and escape before the Academy gets here to draw up the quarantine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That seemed to be the needed <em>push.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d the headmistress said.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t step forward without Mary lashing out.\\xa0 Couldn\\u2019t run and leave the others.\\xa0 A few sounds, and we were utter goners.</p>\\n<p>I needed to convince the headmistress.</p>\\n<p>But I couldn\\u2019t think of the words to do it.\\xa0 If I could figure out what the puppeteer had said, the line of logic\\u2026 professing to be from the Academy, maybe, a long-time plant, protecting the students.</p>\\n<p>Start with what I knew she knew.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe office was locked,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDoors and windows.\\xa0 The letter was signed in blood.\\xa0 Look, blood!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I showed her my hands where the thorns had injured them.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t even flinch, glancing up, then back to the paper.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYu du-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Notecard, cards, pen-</p>\\n<p><em>Letter opener.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cLetter opener!\\u201d I called out.\\xa0 \\u201cYour letter opener.\\xa0 I have it from when I left the note!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNah-\\u201d She stopped partway.\\xa0 I saw a blink.\\xa0 The moment where she <em>wondered</em>.</p>\\n<p>I pointed, but Jamie had already noticed the letter opener.\\xa0 Before I\\u2019d even recalled exactly where it fell, he was sliding it over the tiles.</p>\\n<p>I stopped it with my foot, then kicked it toward the headmistress.</p>\\n<p>It stopped a few feet away from her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s yours.\\xa0 I know it\\u2019s yours.\\xa0 But I have it.\\xa0 <em>Think.\\xa0 </em>Why would the Academy shoot and hurt your other students?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes fell on the one student who had been shot.\\xa0 The one I\\u2019d helped into the line of fire, letting him take a bullet for me.\\xa0 The headmistress looked down at him.\\xa0 Her own hands were bloody from trying to staunch the flow of blood, though his stillness suggested it was too late, the damage done.</p>\\n<p>She let the bloodstained paper fall to the floor.</p>\\n<p>It was as if the words had been read, all the same.\\xa0 Mary charged, mindless or unwilling to think, knife in hand.</p>\\n<p>I ran, but Mary was taller, and she wasn\\u2019t running backward.</p>\\n<p>She closed the distance, knife ready.</p>\\n<p>I knew escape was impossible, futile.</p>\\n<p>But I reached the others, where Helen had joined Jamie and Lil.</p>\\n<p>I grabbed Helen and, before she could react, thrust her in Mary\\u2019s general direction.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t a very good thrust, but it served.</p>\\n<p><em>Better her than me</em>.</p>\\n<p>Helen winced as the knife pierced her side or back.\\xa0 Mary raised the knife up to Helen\\u2019s throat for what would have been a quick and terminal cut, and Helen caught the hand, stopping the blade before it could make contact.</p>\\n<p>Mary settled for taking her hostage.\\xa0 She was breathing harder than the momentary exhaustion justified.\\xa0 I imagined her thoughts were chaos and noise and pain.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlone,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s what you said?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said, my voice soft.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cActing like this, throwing allies away when it suits you, I think you\\u2019re going to end up more alone than I am.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re despicable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNever denied that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo right to say anything to me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I watched Helen tighten her grip on Mary\\u2019s wrist.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI already said most of it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re works in progress.\\xa0 Helen, Gordon here, Jamie, even me, in a lesser way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw Mary\\u2019s expression change.\\xa0 She raised a hand to try and pry Helen\\u2019s hand loose, but Helen grabbed her other wrist.\\xa0 The knife strained to move, but Helen didn\\u2019t let it.</p>\\n<p>Helen wasn\\u2019t a fighter, but that wasn\\u2019t to say she wasn\\u2019t strong.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen isn\\u2019t really an actress.\\xa0 Well, she is, but that\\u2019s not the end result.\\xa0 I planted that seed, reinforced an idea you had already.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen rolled her shoulders, and I could see movements beneath her school uniform, as bones shifted and found new configurations.\\xa0 Her limbs moved in ways they shouldn\\u2019t have, joints bending the wrong way.</p>\\n<p>I looked to one side as Helen raised one leg up, over her own shoulder, and wrapped the foot around the back of Mary\\u2019s neck.\\xa0 Had I been looking, I would have seen up Helen\\u2019s skirt<em>, </em>and that would have been <em>rude</em> of me.</p>\\n<p>Mary made a sound as her struggles failed to make progress.</p>\\n<p>I walked past them, still averting my gaze, and approached the headmistress.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cTake the boy and go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw the confusion and fear, and the momentary relief at having an escape.\\xa0 She fled, carrying the boy in her arms.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBack in the furnace room, I mentioned Doctor Ibott.\\xa0 You cut me off before I could say more about him.\\xa0 See, he\\u2019s the one who handled Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw confusion join alarm on Mary\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d Mary started.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t get further. Helen raised her other leg, and the shift in weight made Mary tip forward.\\xa0 Helen snapped her leg around, taking advantage of the fall to slip herself around behind Mary.\\xa0 Arms moved and twisted, and at the end of it, Helen was on top of Mary, who was face-first on the ground.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s arms were caught beneath and in front of her, Helen\\u2019s hand around hers, forcing her to hold the knife at her own throat.</p>\\n<p>Every muscle and bone seemed to be straining in the wrong ways against Helen\\u2019s skin.\\xa0 It conjured up ideas of an insect, or a starved jungle cat, perched atop its prey.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut Ibott only does <em>big</em> things.\\xa0 Monsters that can win wars.\\xa0 Juggernauts and ship sinkers.\\xa0 Well, the guy who heads our project poked at Ibott\\u2019s pride, and got Ibott to do something smaller and cleverer.\\xa0 Helen\\u2019s the only one of us who isn\\u2019t human, you know.\\xa0 Vat grown, like you, but built from scratch.\\xa0 She\\u2019s only an actress because she had to learn from the beginning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary made a strangled sound.\\xa0 Helen was choking her, staring down at her with a blank expression.</p>\\n<p>I bent down, and I picked up the bloodstained paper the headmistress had dropped.</p>\\n<p>I read it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re works in progress.\\xa0 Helen\\u2019s still growing into her role.\\xa0 The femme fatale.\\xa0 A little odd when she\\u2019s still a <em>child</em>, but she\\u2019ll be <em>something</em> when she\\u2019s older.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I glanced over at Mary, who was struggling and failing to escape Helen\\u2019s embrace, then folded up the paper and stuck it in my waistband.\\xa0 I reached for Mary\\u2019s file folder, and withdrew a paper.\\xa0 I\\u2019d thought I\\u2019d use it to compare notes if I could find Percy\\u2019s place and break in, but this would do.</p>\\n<p>I reached down and touched the bloodstain where the shot child had fallen.\\xa0 I gripped the paper, crumpling it in my hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet her go, Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen did.\\xa0 When she let go of Mary\\u2019s hand, Mary let go of the knife.\\xa0 Helen collected it.</p>\\n<p>Mary didn\\u2019t move as I approached.\\xa0 The fight was gone out of her.</p>\\n<p>I held the bloodstained paper.</p>\\n<p>Then I tore it, slowly, for dramatic effect, into very small pieces.</p>\\n<p>I let the pieces fall in front of Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s your call,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFight to the death like he wanted, or stick it to him.\\xa0 Join us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It took a long time before she found the courage to nod.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I sat in the rain, watching the

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/07/21/stitch-in-time-4-11/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Warren didn\\u2019t give chase.\\xa0 Wendy and I made our way to the room with the coats.\\xa0 The room\\u2019s resident and her monster were still unconscious, but the others were already outside, standing a few feet away from the open window, a vantage point where they could see within.\\xa0 The snow was falling all around them, it was dark, and the little light around the place cast long shadows.</p>\\n<p>There wasn\\u2019t any commentary as I reached under the bed, grabbed my jacket, scarf, cap, and gloves, and pulled everything on.</p>\\n<p>I glanced at Wendy, who looked like a ghost in more ways than one.\\xa0 Fine, pale hair, a haunted expression on her face.\\xa0 She wore a calf-length dress that was crisp and tidy enough it was almost a uniform, complete with a smock, and her hair was tied back.\\xa0 I could see subtle differences in the color and texture of it, suggesting that hair had been transplanted \\u2013 a stitched\\u2019s hair didn\\u2019t tend to grow, or it fell out faster than it grew in, and it was telling that she\\u2019d been looked after in that regard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou need a coat,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m always hot, I-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou need a coat,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re always hot because it keeps you healthy.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re out in the cold, your body will have to work harder to stay hot, and you might run out of energy too quickly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I walked past her, stepping past the monster on the floor to get to the wardrobe by the door.\\xa0 I popped it open, then rifled through the hanging garments until I found something suitable, a long coat of black, lab-grown wool.\\xa0 I handed it to Wendy, and watched as she put it on.\\xa0 Her movements were stiff, and once or twice she paused, as if she had to remember or puzzle out the next sequence of movements to put her arms in the sleeves.\\xa0 I stepped in to grab the jacket and help it over her shoulder.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s big,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 It was true.\\xa0 Two of her could have fit in the jacket.</p>\\n<p>I grabbed a long scarf from the closet, then wound it around her waist, cinching the coat closer to her body.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I saw her look back, the doubt on her face, and grabbed her hand, pulling her along.\\xa0 It was a strange inversion of adult and child, the child leading the adult by the hand, but in reality, she was the innocent.\\xa0 She was the key to all of this, our last hope in figuring out how we were going to address the Fray situation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThrough the window,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I gave her a hand in making her way down, and the others moved to the base of the window to help her down.\\xa0 She was a little heavier than someone her size should have been, and her movements were stiff.\\xa0 I\\u2019d interacted with stitched in general to know that sometimes patience was required.</p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019s not so different from me.\\xa0 We lose what we don\\u2019t hold on to.</em></p>\\n<p>Except it was poisons that had eroded my faculties, and it was death that had eroded hers.</p>\\n<p>I wondered if Fray had made the same connection.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHere we go,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s it.\\xa0 Lower your left foot just a little bit.\\xa0 That\\u2019s your right.\\xa0 There.\\xa0 Good job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Good work, Helen</em>, I thought.\\xa0 I\\u2019d brought her here, but I wasn\\u2019t necessarily the person to keep her, if that was even possible in the long run.\\xa0 Wendy would feel more comfortable in Helen\\u2019s company than anything else.\\xa0 Gordon was a possibility as well, and Lillian likely had as much passing experience with the stitched as any of us.</p>\\n<p>Once Wendy was down from the window, I climbed out onto the snow-dusted windowsill and pulled the window shut.\\xa0 I dropped into the grass at the base of the window.</p>\\n<p>The evening was cooler, which contributed to the heavier snowfall, but it still wasn\\u2019t enough to cover the grass completely, nor to do more than layer the trees.\\xa0 With the sky getting dark, the odd and unusual trees of Kensford took on a more haunting appearance, jagged black lightning bolts with highlights of white here and there.\\xa0 The cottage-like dormitory houses were lighting up within, and they were small enough that each little window of orange flame or flickering voltaic power had silhouettes moving within.\\xa0 Young women were moving down the main streets in groups, accompanied by their monsters, but the sounds of conversation and footfalls didn\\u2019t reach us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have questions, but it\\u2019s hard to ask them, given present company,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She was scuffed up, but Lillian had applied bandages and applied a shot of something.</p>\\n<p>Wendy was looking around, oblivious.\\xa0 She seemed anxious, but not out of any concern for her personal safety.\\xa0 When Gordon took her hand, she wasn\\u2019t surprised or spooked.\\xa0 She took his hand and held it firm, not even questioning it.</p>\\n<p>Some stitched were made for battle.\\xa0 Wendy wasn\\u2019t one of those stitched.\\xa0 Someone could likely have come after her with a weapon and she wouldn\\u2019t have defended herself.\\xa0 On much the same level, an enemy might be able to give her a hug without her even thinking of resisting.\\xa0 There were vital parts of her psychology that were missing.</p>\\n<p>But Gordon being the one holding her hand helped.\\xa0 He had always had an affinity for other experiments.\\xa0 There were maybe four people who could communicate with Dog, despite Dog\\u2019s general inability to vocalize; Catcher was one, two scientists who maintained and looked after Dog were another couple, and Gordon was a fourth.</p>\\n<p>There were even some Whelps that he could pet without getting his hand bitten off, and the Academy doctors who worked on the Whelps weren\\u2019t even capable of doing that.</p>\\n<p>Gordon saw me looking at him and asked, \\u201cWe aren\\u2019t being followed?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, simply.\\xa0 No use agitating Wendy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t go back to the dormitory house with our stuff.\\xa0 If Fray has any brains at all, she\\u2019ll send Warren that way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s possible,\\u201d I said, but I wasn\\u2019t convinced.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s possible, but you don\\u2019t sound confident,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I replied.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s what <em>you\\u2019d</em> do in her shoes, but that\\u2019s not who she is.\\xa0 She\\u2019s indirect.\\xa0 She just revealed the big plan to us, she did it for a reason.\\xa0 We got close, and if Warren doesn\\u2019t stop us, she wants us distracted, dealing with it.\\xa0 It was always part of her strategy.\\xa0 If we cornered her, she would distract us.\\xa0 She doesn\\u2019t do the \\u2018direct attack\\u2019 thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe sent\\u2026 you know who after us,\\u201d Jamie remarked.\\xa0 \\u201cTwice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho?\\u201d Wendy asked, looking concerned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Helen said, giving Wendy\\u2019s hand a squeeze.\\xa0 \\u201cCan you hold my hands between yours?\\xa0 They\\u2019re toasty.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, okay,\\u201d Wendy said.\\xa0 She looked happy to do it, and Helen\\u2019s smile brought out a smile on her face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe first time was indirect,\\u201d I told Gordon.\\xa0 \\u201cShe was trying to divert us, and it worked.\\xa0 We <em>had</em> to deal with the medicine angle, we were distracted, led to chase her, and it gave her an opportunity to have a discussion with one of us.\\xa0 This time\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis time?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe caught her off guard.\\xa0 This time, she didn\\u2019t expect us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA cornered rat bites,\\u201d Mary commented, under her breath.</p>\\n<p>There were a few nods from the group at that.\\xa0 Mary had been bitten as hard as any of us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t like rats,\\u201d Wendy said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot unless they\\u2019re the clean white ones in the labs.\\xa0 Those can be cute.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t they!?\\u201d Helen gushed.\\xa0 \\u201cDid Miss Genevieve have any?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny\\u2026?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid she have white rats to help her in the lab?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, she did.\\xa0 I liked them.\\xa0 There was one and it would crawl on my hand and I would pet it.\\xa0 But I had to be gentle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re so lucky, having hands as warm as yours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was a silly, stupid compliment, but Wendy seemed to like it.</p>\\n<p>The rest of us were silent, watching and listening intently.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe wasn\\u2019t mean to them, was she?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>Wendy shook her head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe didn\\u2019t give them medicine to make them sick or stick them with syringes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wendy kept shaking her head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut she was paying a lot of attention to the rats?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, not a lot.\\xa0 But some.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome,\\u201d Wendy said, as if that was a complete idea.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen you say some, do you mean it was once in a while, or were there other things she was more focused on?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>Wendy didn\\u2019t answer, raising her hand to her mouth, as if she were going to bite her nails, then pulled it away.\\xa0 She looked between us, as if she was completely lost.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t understand, do you?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Wendy shook her head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He reached out and put his hands around hers, which still held Helen\\u2019s.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you remember what we were saying about the white rats?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were talking about rats?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t tell if it was a question or if it was a statement she wasn\\u2019t entirely sure about.</p>\\n<p>She felt emotions, and the spectrum of emotions might well have been limited or more riddled with bumps and messiness, but that part of the brain was still intact.\\xa0 She could think and reason and perform set tasks, but her faculties outside of the tasks she was meant to perform were hampered.\\xa0 When it came to logic and interpretation, well, this very conversation had evidenced that a single stumble could take us back to square one.</p>\\n<p><em>No,</em> I realized, looking at her.\\xa0 A step back from square one.\\xa0 She was anxious now, bothered.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t like being lost, and the combined efforts of Gordon and Helen weren\\u2019t enough to reassure her.</p>\\n<p>She was our sole source of information, but an interrogation couldn\\u2019t proceed like this.\\xa0 We had to move slowly, carefully, and as gently as humanly possible, and we had to do it knowing that Fray was very possibly working on her next move.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s give her a few minutes,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p><em>No</em><em>!</em>\\xa0 I thought.</p>\\n<p>Then I reminded myself that his instincts were very often good ones, when it came to dealing with experiments.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut let\\u2019s do something productive in the meantime.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you thinking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m thinking we need to slow our adversary down,\\u201d I said, keeping my voice quiet and calm for the benefit of our stitched guest, \\u201cShe <em>knows</em> we have the means of figuring out what she\\u2019s doing.\\xa0 She dropped hints.\\xa0 She\\u2019s <em>ready</em>.\\xa0 If there\\u2019s a catalyst she needs to enter into the dynamic, or if there\\u2019s a switch that has to be pulled, a person that needs to be contacted, we need to get in the way of that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Talking in abstract terms and long words wasn\\u2019t helping matters.\\xa0 Wendy looked more confused and alarmed than before.</p>\\n<p><em>Bring things back, Sy.\\xa0 Connect it to something she understands</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOur goal,\\u201d I said, talking more slowly, not looking directly at Wendy, even as I recapped things for her benefit, \\u201cIs to keep people safe.\\xa0 We want to find Genevieve, we want to find and help <em>Warren</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I put emphasis on that last part, so the others could know just why Wendy was here.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s doable,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I saw a smile find its way to Wendy\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFirst instinct, each of you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow can we accomplish this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI go hunt,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI can stay out of Warren\\u2019s way.\\xa0 Maybe catch Fray off guard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon and I exchanged glances.\\xa0 I could see the doubt and concern.</p>\\n<p>A lack of trust.\\xa0 Mary was hurt, and she wasn\\u2019t immune to making mistakes.</p>\\n<p>I gave him a nod.\\xa0 We needed to do this, if only because Mary\\u2019s pride couldn\\u2019t take anything else.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf in doubt, favor scouting over trying something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll stay with Wendy.\\xa0 We can go to the campfire, where you met the girls,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe took the time to recruit them, we should use them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll either come with you or meet up with you shortly, we\\u2019ll have a good chat with Wendy.\\xa0 Jamie?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInfrastructure.\\xa0 The school.\\xa0 They have to have measures in place in case of trouble.\\xa0 Even if they aren\\u2019t obvious.\\xa0 We just need to ask the head of Dame Cicely\\u2019s, or someone else in a position to know.\\xa0 I know most of the faculty\\u2019s names-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFrom the book in the room,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 I might be a little out of date, but I can get something in motion.\\xa0 Soldiers, security measures, quarantine\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToo dangerous,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019d have to go through the school, and you could run into Warren.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was thinking we could knock on doors for the larger homes near the Academy,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere the staff probably live.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon looked where Jamie was pointing.\\xa0 The houses in that general direction weren\\u2019t taller, but they sprawled more, many had multiple trees on the property, and if memory served, they\\u2019d had more extensive gardens.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMakes sense,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian, go with him.\\xa0 You can fill in the gaps, you have the knowledge to know what the quarantine measures might involve.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll rally some of the people who we recruited before,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can maneuver to limit her range of movement, now that we know where she is.\\xa0 If there\\u2019s anything in the building that she can\\u2019t leave behind, then she\\u2019ll have to hang back-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I cut Gordon off.\\xa0 \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t work like that.\\xa0 She said she already put it into motion.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not something like that, and it can\\u2019t be something she needs to pack up, because she\\u2019s been moving too fast and too far.\\xa0 She met Lady Claire and she made a connection, and then she moved in.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a lot harder to do if you\\u2019re bringing a small lab with you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re assuming she\\u2019s telling the truth,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah, I am.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause I don\\u2019t think she thinks lying would serve any purpose,\\u201d I said, simply.</p>\\n<p>Gordon frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re romanticizing her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m figuring her out,\\u201d I said, a little testily.\\xa0 \\u201cGenevieve Fray is putting up a front, one that she buys into, at least a little.\\xa0 That she\\u2019s doing the right thing, that she\\u2019s being fair, and being nice.\\xa0 Anyone that gets in her way is the bad guy.\\xa0 If and when she runs into trouble or if the plans fall through, or if push comes to shove, she gets to feel justified because she played fair, she was honest, and the bad guys were the ones who crossed the line.\\xa0 That idea is worth more than whatever ground she might gain by outright lying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich doesn\\u2019t reveal much of anything about the person behind that front, who might not be a good person at all, and who would feel no need to pretend,\\u201d I added, as an afterthought.\\xa0 \\u201cBut the Genevieve Fray I\\u2019ve talked to puts a lot of stock in being straightforward.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d he said, again.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to talk, later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor now, we go with your instincts.\\xa0 We assume she isn\\u2019t lying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEveryone knows where they\\u2019re going, then?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWe meet at the fire where the failed students hang out.\\xa0 Mary, keep an eye on Jamie and Lillian.\\xa0 I know it\\u2019ll be hard as you get further away, but do what you can to keep an eye on each other.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>It was good.\\xa0 Telling Mary that in a way that let Lillian and Jamie know that the inverse was also true.\\xa0 <em>Keep an eye on Mary.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s move.\\xa0 Close the net, let\\u2019s help Warren, best as we can,\\u201d Gordon said, echoing me, though the look in his eye was telling.</p>\\n<p><em>Fray is going to make a move,</em> I thought.\\xa0 I doubted we could stop it.\\xa0 She was the iron fist in the velvet glove, gentleness and passivity on the surface, but force and determination lurking within.\\xa0 The moment we had an edge, well, most fists came in pairs, and there was no velvet where Warren was concerned.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Wendy, and I could imagine Warren as the inverse of Fray.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t lost or completely given over to his monstrous, brutish nature.\\xa0 There was something gentle at the core.\\xa0 Velvet was the wrong word for it, though.</p>\\n<p>We broke away from the other group, entering the edges of the woods that encircled the upper half of Kensford and Dame Cicely\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>This was a route that Jamie would have been better equipped to navigate.\\xa0 Without much light to go by and with very few landmarks, we were largely in the dark.</p>\\n<p>But the campfire was a place where the fire was almost perpetually burning.\\xa0 These weren\\u2019t students who slept.\\xa0 They were people without futures, or people who thought they lacked futures, and people like that didn\\u2019t sleep easy.\\xa0 Even if death was metaphorical, a loss of all choice and greater hope, one didn\\u2019t want to squander their remaining days or months sleeping.</p>\\n<p>\\u2018Ronnie\\u2019 was there, sitting by the fire, with a few monsters and two young women, less than had been here before.\\xa0 Her surgically modified face stared down into the flames.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re here,\\u201d Gordon observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m managing things,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cTelling people where to go, covering important spots.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need you to manage things in another direction.\\xa0 We found her,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Ronnie sat up, but the look of surprise on her face wasn\\u2019t a look of <em>pleasant</em> surprise.\\xa0 She looked upset, offended.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to take this chance from you,\\u201d I said, quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re creepy little ones, eh?\\u201d Ronnie asked, in her odd accent, before settling back down.\\xa0 \\u201cStepping out of the shadows, talking about big things, like you know me somehow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>You\\u2019re easy to read</em>.\\xa0 <em>Everyone, deep down inside, they want something, they fear something, they feel hungers.\\xa0 The amounts and the flavors of these things vary, but you wear it on your face</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have time to dally,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow fast can you get the others to Dame Cicely\\u2019s?\\xa0 She was in the basement labs, she\\u2019s leaving right this second.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s leaving.\\xa0 Was she ever real?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGenevieve Fray was real,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe was real,\\u201d Wendy echoed me.</p>\\n<p>Ronnie\\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo this, we put in a good word with people that count,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot for <em>all</em> of you, but for you, and the ones you care the most about.\\xa0 I know you have some who are here just because, and you have some who are here, who truly belong, your <em>allies.\\xa0 </em>Genuinely help us, succeed or fail, and I promise you you\\u2019ll get what you need.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBig promises,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t sound convinced.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour call,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Ronnie frowned, then she looked at the girls sitting next to her, first one, then the other, talking under her breath.</p>\\n<p>They broke off into a run.\\xa0 One hopped onto the back of the creature that had been slumbering behind her, hugging its back with her hood up and her head down by its shoulder as it darted off into the brush.\\xa0 The other proceeded on foot, her pet lumbering behind her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s go sit by the fire, honey,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWarm you up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m already warm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll make it easier to be warm,\\u201d Helen coaxed.</p>\\n<p>We gathered on the bench, while Ronnie remained where she was, watching intently.</p>\\n<p>I looked at the girl and raised a finger to my lips.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t give any indication that she\\u2019d seen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGenevieve was working on something, wasn\\u2019t she?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you know what she was working on?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wendy shook her head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat sort of things was she doing?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThings?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen she was in the lab.\\xa0 Was there anything she focused on?\\xa0 Things she paid more attention to?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t- I don\\u2019t-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Gordon hurried to say.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay.\\xa0 That\\u2019s fine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Too complicated.</em></p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d died.\\xa0 Her old memories were gone, her faculties more limited.\\xa0 Even if the brain was rescued promptly after death, death was death.\\xa0 There was always some damage.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid she ever talk about viruses?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>Wendy shook her head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBacteria?\\xa0 Parasites?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A pause, a frown, a few seconds thought.\\xa0 Then, once again, a shake of the head.</p>\\n<p>I thought of something Fray had mentioned, then jumped in, \\u201cThere are monsters in every town.\\xa0 Did she talk about those?\\xa0 About paying visits to anyone or anything in particular?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The frown was deeper.\\xa0 I saw the fidgeting.</p>\\n<p>I could have interrupted, before her thoughts worked themselves into a corner and something gave, but this one was important.\\xa0 We had some basis in fact.\\xa0 Much as I\\u2019d described to Gordon, Fray was obvious, she was direct.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want Warren,\\u201d Wendy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Helen said, gentle.\\xa0 She gave Wendy a pat on the shoulder.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want Warren,\\u201d Wendy said, monotone.</p>\\n<p>Repetition.\\xa0 Regression.\\xa0 I was getting anxious now, frustrated.\\xa0 I <em>understood</em>, she wasn\\u2019t the first or the fifth or the <em>fiftieth</em> stitched I\\u2019d ever talked to, but we were facing a crunch, and now she was backsliding, falling back to safer mental processes and emotions.\\xa0 We might not get anywhere at this rate.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Helen murmured, again.\\xa0 \\u201cI know, honey.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook, Wendy, look at me.\\xa0 Come on\\u2026 there you go,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He was pulling his jacket off, and then he rolled up his sleeve.\\xa0 He extended his arm.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if you can see in the firelight, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo colors,\\u201d Wendy said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy eyes aren\\u2019t very good, especially this eye, but you\\u2019re patchy.\\xa0 Like me, a little.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m patchy, yeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He offered a smile.\\xa0 \\u201cYou and I, we aren\\u2019t so different.\\xa0 I\\u2019m kind of like a stitched.\\xa0 Not really, but kind of.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded, paying rapt attention.\\xa0 Her eyes didn\\u2019t leave his arm.\\xa0 There were stretches that were slightly more tan than others.\\xa0 Most of him, it wasn\\u2019t obvious, but on this part of the arm there was a length where a straight line marked the difference between two very different sorts of skin.\\xa0 No scars, no stitches, just one kind of skin blending into the next.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI really care about these guys.\\xa0 Just like you care about Warren, okay?\\xa0 I know exactly how you feel.\\xa0 We\\u2019re similar like that, too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe had someone join our group, almost a year ago now.\\xa0 Mary.\\xa0 It was pretty obvious from the start that she fit in.\\xa0 Not a perfect fit, but a good enough one.\\xa0 She was different.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re supposed to stay with us.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think you <em>feel</em> like you\\u2019re supposed to stay with us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon made a point of looking over at me and Helen.\\xa0 He was saying that to us as much as he was saying it to Wendy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI miss Warren,\\u201d Wendy said, again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to go back to him soon, alright?\\xa0 We\\u2019re going to make that happen.\\xa0 That\\u2019s where you belong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wendy nodded, more vigorously this time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut we need to help him first,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need your help to help him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wendy nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat sort of things did Genevieve talk about, when she was working?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChemicals,\\u201d Wendy said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t remember the names.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, what else?\\xa0 What sort of things did she talk about when Lady Claire wasn\\u2019t around?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Wendy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTry again, Wendy.\\xa0 What sort of things?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLady Claire was always around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Back to the beginning.\\xa0 Things she talked about.\\xa0 She talked about chemicals?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat about ratios?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSometimes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoisons?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A head shake.\\xa0 No.</p>\\n<p>No.\\xa0 Lady Claire hadn\\u2019t been a true rebel.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been surprised to find out what Fray was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWere they working on something to help people?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>The stitched girl snapped her head around to look at me, but didn\\u2019t give a response.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA big project, something that would prove that Lady Claire deserved to continue being a student?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\xa0 Yes?\\xa0 Sort of?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Helen coaxed.\\xa0 \\u201cJust say what you\\u2019re thinking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t- I\\u2019m not\\u2026 not good at thinking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChrist,\\u201d Ronnie said, under her breath, the accent slipping, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t seen many stitched like that one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I raised my finger to my mouth again, to remind the girl.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s well made,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>The frustration was getting to be too much.\\xa0 I stood from my seat.\\xa0 Fray <em>knew</em> we would zero in on what she was doing, the moment Warren conveyed that we\\u2019d gotten our hands on Wendy.\\xa0 She\\u2019d put her plan into motion, to maximize the damage.</p>\\n<p>I paced a little.</p>\\n<p>Whatever it was, it was going to be disastrous.\\xa0 Not a monster, not a plague, not a parasite\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe said, she said that she was going to help the Academy,\\u201d Wendy said.</p>\\n<p>Helen, Gordon and I looked at Wendy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Help?</em>\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s\\u2026 that\\u2019s what she said.\\xa0 It was a big job, and Lady Claire was going to get credit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you don\\u2019t know <em>what?</em>\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>A noise in the bushes startled us.\\xa0 A group of girls had arrived through the woods.\\xa0 Some held lanterns.\\xa0 The lights danced unpredictably, the shadows swaying this way and that.</p>\\n<p>A dark night.\\xa0 The wind was picking up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCarriage just past the woods,\\u201d one girl said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat do you need?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDame Cicely\\u2019s,\\u201d Ronnie said.\\xa0 \\u201cSurround the school.\\xa0 If there are any doors you can knock on or anyone you can pull from the lunch room, acquaintances, people you think might listen to you, do it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpread word,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet people know there\\u2019s someone dangerous inside, and tell them there\\u2019s reward money.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBig guy and a woman with crimson lipstick,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSearch the woods beyond the school, and patrol the streets.\\xa0 The big guy is hard to miss, and he\\u2019s lightly injured.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you see a girl with ribbons in her hair, and it doesn\\u2019t look like she\\u2019s hiding, do what she says,\\u201d I added.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever they said,\\u201d Ronnie said.\\xa0 \\u201cGo, and <em>hurry</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The girls turned and hurried back through the woods.</p>\\n<p>I hoped Jamie and Lillian were having more luck rallying help, or that Mary had an eye on Fray.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re doing well,\\u201d Gordon reassured Wendy.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know what it was that Genevieve and Lady Claire were going to do?\\xa0 To help the Academy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wendy shook her head.</p>\\n<p>It was so little.\\xa0 Cryptic.</p>\\n<p>I thought of my earlier idea, of the monsters hidden within each small town in the periphery of the big ones.</p>\\n<p>Would she help the Academy by releasing one of the monsters?</p>\\n<p>Hard to justify, hard to explain.\\xa0 Lady Claire wouldn\\u2019t buy into that so easily.</p>\\n<p>Something more benign, something that could fit into a lie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy head hurts,\\u201d Wendy said.\\xa0 Her breath didn\\u2019t fog up in the cold, but there was a light haze rising from her body.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome here,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cLie down.\\xa0 Head down here, and get just a little way away from the fire.\\xa0 I think you\\u2019re toasty enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wendy nodded, lying down with her head in Helen\\u2019s lap.</p>\\n<p>Was that all we were going to get out of her?\\xa0 She still served as a hostage, in an abstract way.\\xa0 It was amusing.\\xa0 The Lambs, myself included, would put a human in the line of fire if we needed a hostage or if we needed to hurt someone to get a step closer in our goals.\\xa0 It was somehow harder to do with someone or something like Wendy.</p>\\n<p>Not impossible.\\xa0 Simply harder.</p>\\n<p>Better to use her as a negotiation chip, and a way to tether Fray.\\xa0 Warren wouldn\\u2019t leave without Wendy, and Fray most likely wouldn\\u2019t leave without Warren.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I finally said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon agreed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Helen said, softly, brushing at Wendy\\u2019s hair with her fingers.\\xa0 Odd, that she was so gentle, but I had little doubt she\\u2019d be fastest to act if she needed to hurt Wendy to further our goals.</p>\\n<p>Well, going from gentle sweetness to murder at a moment\\u2019s notice was what she had been made for, in a way.</p>\\n<p>We sat in silence for a little while.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe should go find the others,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen, you stay.\\xa0 I doubt Fray is going to find you here, and we need to keep her stitched away from her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was thinking along the same lines I was.</p>\\n<p>Helen nodded.</p>\\n<p>He and I stood, and we started on our way through the woods, back to the others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou wanted to talk about something,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMe and Fray?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you thinking straight?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo I ever?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re more capable of thinking straight than you let on, yeah,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>We pushed our way through a thicket of branches between a set of trees.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to beat her so badly,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cA part of me wonders, though.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWonders?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019d let her go, so you could have the challenge.\\xa0 If, should the situation come down to it, you\\u2019d just miss, or make a mistake.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nearly tripped over something hidden under leaves and snow.\\xa0 I caught myself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re sure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sure,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe with Mauer, I might, but not Fray.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\xa0 What\\u2019s the difference?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy are you even asking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause I don\\u2019t <em>get</em> you, Sy,\\u201d he said, tense.\\xa0 \\u201cI try, I can put my mind to it and I can see how you think, with the angles and weirdness, but seeing you in the midst of this, your thoughts are ranging too far afield, I can\\u2019t track them.\\xa0 We were complaining about the way the team wasn\\u2019t holding together, but you\\u2019ve unhitched the horse from the wagon here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe horse is still hitched to the wagon, Gordon,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m sort of pissed you\\u2019re implying different.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNah,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNah?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll take your word for it,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t sound like you believe me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy, relax.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe hell?\\xa0 How am I supposed to relax when you\\u2019re questioning me and coming after me and suggesting I\\u2019d help <em>her</em> before I helped you guys?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not what I\\u2019m trying to do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re being a <em>dick.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m-\\u201d he started, then he stopped.\\xa0 \\u201cHold on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I bit my tongue.\\xa0 We moved in near-silence for a minute, pushing through frosted vegetation in the dark, the occasional leaf or twig crunching underfoot.\\xa0 We were close enough to see the lights.\\xa0 The entire Academy was alight.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t that <em>late</em>, all things told, but it was winter, we were a little ways up North, and the days were short.\\xa0 People would be at dinner.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie and Mary didn\\u2019t get along, when I paired them up earlier, remember?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen and Lillian, they\\u2019re not much of a match either, you know?\\xa0 Lillian\\u2019s a little scared to work on Helen, even, after Ibott blew up at her a few times.\\xa0 But they don\\u2019t play off each other well, either.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey handled the Sub Rosa thing pretty well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPretty well,\\u201d Gordon admitted.\\xa0 \\u201cBut what I\\u2019m getting at, is you and I\\u2026\\xa0 I <em>like</em> you, Sy, I admire you, but we\\u2019re pretty diametrically opposed in how we approach things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 He could pick up something and be good at it from the outset.\\xa0 I could focus on something and get very, very good at it, given time.\\xa0 He was maturing fastest, he was most physically fit.\\xa0 I was lagging behind to an alarming degree, and I couldn\\u2019t even fare that well against Jamie in a mock fight, anymore.\\xa0 <em>Jamie</em>, of all people.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not a bad thing,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBeing different.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 No it isn\\u2019t.\\xa0 We thrive in diversity.\\xa0 I think that\\u2019s one of the Academy mottoes.\\xa0 But that doesn\\u2019t mean there aren\\u2019t issues.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFair,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me what you\\u2019re thinking, Sy,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout Fray.\\xa0 Because you seem to think you have a sense of her, and I\\u2019m not feeling it.\\xa0 You\\u2019re making little mistakes, and that tells me you\\u2019re not as right as you think you are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I bristled at that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t be a hundred percent right with her,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I thought for a second, trying to find the words with which to explain.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s\\u2026 she has no aggression, she doesn\\u2019t let aggression touch her.\\xa0 If you hit her head on, she doesn\\u2019t fly back.\\xa0 She just diffuses the impact, makes it wasted effort.\\xa0 She shows something on the surface, but there\\u2019s a depth there she\\u2019s hiding.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve got a look on your face,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cLike you\\u2019re concentrating really hard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m\\u2026\\u201d I said, but he wasn\\u2019t wrong.\\xa0 I had all the thoughts and puzzle pieces in my head, the mystery that was Fray and what Fray was doing.\\xa0 Wendy\\u2019s commentary was a big factor in making the connections.\\xa0 Even behind the scenes, there hadn\\u2019t been an iron fist within the velvet glove.</p>\\n<p>I was feeling like I was on the cusp of something, just about ready to have the explanation fall off my tongue.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s transparent,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI keep coming back to water imagery.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWater.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>I thought of the sea monster within the river, that I had watched with Fray.\\xa0 It had been sluggish, sick.</p>\\n<p>She had <em>showed</em> me, right from the outset.</p>\\n<p>The lab in the basement of Dame Cicely\\u2019s.\\xa0 The water had been running beneath the school, fueling its projects.\\xa0 She had access.</p>\\n<p>Water was the source of all life.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe did something to the water supply,\\u201d I realized, aloud.\\xa0 I pushed harder through the branches, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 Hell, Sy, this school has the daughters of some of the Crown\\u2019s elite in attendance!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething subtle, whatever it is, they\\u2019ve all already been dosed, damn it!\\u201d I said, almost running now, not caring about the branches that scraped me.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd people are going to find out, because she\\u2019s going to <em>inform</em> them, and it\\u2019s going to be catastrophic!\\xa0 We need to find the people in charge and we need to start running damage control right away!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We reached the edge of the forest.\\xa0 Wendy and Helen were safe in a hiding spot that Fray wasn\\u2019t likely to find.\\xa0 Our eyes fell on a group of girls who were standing around the school, one of them was someone we\\u2019d seen at the fire.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell the other girls.\\xa0 They have to find the faculty, tell them to meet us out here, it\\u2019s an emergency,\\u201d I told them.\\xa0 I passed the girl my badge.\\xa0 \\u201cShow them this, they should understand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou want to let the woman go?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was a good question.\\xa0 We were playing directly into Fray\\u2019s hands, creating gaps in the perimeter.\\xa0 Fray had known we would have to.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t give the answer.\\xa0 Doing it would prove Gordon right.\\xa0 I looked to him to make the call, to decide.</p>\\n<p>Had I communicated well enough about Fray for him to understand this?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you have to,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cPrioritize warning people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/07/23/stitch-in-time-4-12/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The faculty of Dame Cicely\\u2019s Academy had a cushy setup.\\xa0 The furniture looked like masterwork, the chairs were all padded and upholstered in Academy-created leathers, and the walls were alternately large windows with draping curtains in fine fabric and large ostentatious pictures with ostentatious frames.\\xa0 Blue and silver were common themes to the room, and even the covers for the fireplace at the back and the lamps on the walls were stained glass.</p>\\n<p>There were ten members of the faculty in attendance, and several stitched servants, not unlike Wendy in quality and class.\\xa0 Two young women were standing by, and one was the one who I\\u2019d given my badge to, with orders to collect the faculty.</p>\\n<p>All of us were present, with the exception of Helen, who was with Wendy still.\\xa0 Mary stood on my right, Jamie on my left.\\xa0 Lillian and Gordon had the lead, here.\\xa0 Gordon was doing okay, but the rest of us were breathing hard; Mary was hurt, and the rest of us were tired from running around, trying to coordinate.</p>\\n<p>Fray was gone, and Mary hadn\\u2019t been up to a prolonged chase.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs this a joke?\\u201d the headmaster asked.\\xa0 He was an older man, and he\\u2019d altered his hair so it grew in white, which was the fashion in places.\\xa0 When seemingly perpetual youth became too ordinary among the elderly of the elite, a calculated sort of aging had taken over.\\xa0 Unfortunately, the white of his hair had come in more like skunk stripes than salt and peppering.\\xa0 His suit jacket fit too closely at the waist and his slacks were too narrow.\\xa0 What drew the eye, however, was the androgynous face with the calculating stare, forever looking down on the people around him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe water supply was tainted,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd it was done from within Dame Cicely\\u2019s walls.\\xa0 We just sent someone to go run tests on it.\\xa0 The person who committed the act is going to inform the public and shift the blame.\\xa0 You have a disaster on your hands, this is your advance warning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re children,\\u201d the headmaster said, at the same time a bald faculty member in a heavy coat asked, \\u201cYou\\u2019re sure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The headmaster shot the bald man a stern look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, we are,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cAnd yes, we\\u2019re sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I appreciated that he hadn\\u2019t felt the need to double check with me.\\xa0 I wondered if he\\u2019d been as confident as he had because he really trusted me, or if he thought he couldn\\u2019t show doubt to our audience in this situation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou saw the badge,\\u201d I said, stepping around Lillian to make myself more visible.\\xa0 Being in the middle of the second row made me easy to overlook.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI saw <em>a</em> badge, but I don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s supposed to mean,\\u201d the headmaster said.\\xa0 He held up the badge.\\xa0 \\u201cRadham Academy.\\xa0 Your problems are becoming our problems?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYour entire student body may have been drugged.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t know what with.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSuggesting it <em>could</em> be a hoax.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt could be a death sentence,\\u201d I said. \\u201cFor all of your students, and for Dame Cicely\\u2019s as an institution.\\xa0 If you misstep here, then there\\u2019s no recovering from it.\\xa0 Your career is over.\\xa0 There are too many powerful people with daughters and nieces here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I claim an emergency at the word of children and find out it\\u2019s a hoax, I lose all reputation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were alerted about Genevieve Fray,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe notice should have gone out to every police station and Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d the headmaster said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you saying you weren\\u2019t aware that Genevieve Fray was tutoring your daughter?\\xa0 Using her as an accomplice in her plan?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t aware,\\u201d the headmaster lied, staring at us.</p>\\n<p>That shook my confidence more than anything.\\xa0 The brazenness of the way he said it, almost sarcastically, mocking us.\\xa0 Declaring to us that he, on the most basic level, didn\\u2019t care at all whether we took him at his word.\\xa0 His gaze was cool and controlled as he met my eyes.\\xa0 He had no shame, no guilt, and no doubts.</p>\\n<p><em>He knows full well what Fray was doing</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is a waste of time,\\u201d I said, to Gordon.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re better off focusing elsewhere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere?\\u201d he asked, murmuring.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFinding Fray?\\xa0 Getting ahead of things on the ground level.\\xa0 If we can figure out how she\\u2019s going to communicate to the citizens of Kensford, or if we assume she\\u2019s going to reach out to the other cities she\\u2019s been to-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPhone?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cA city as big as Radham has maybe twenty, a city this size can\\u2019t have more than five.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a good starting point,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat about birds?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cNo matter how fast we travel, we can\\u2019t-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChildren,\\u201d the headmaster said.</p>\\n<p>We fell silent, looking at the dandy of a man.\\xa0 I eyed the badge he still held.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou invited us here, you brought up a threat with no proof or details of what the threat specifically <em>entails</em>, it\\u2019s strange.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith all due respect,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe entire situation-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m due more respect than that,\\u201d the headmaster said, cutting Gordon off.\\xa0 He strode forward, until he was close enough to Gordon that Gordon had to strain to look up.\\xa0 \\u201cMy students call me sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir-\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He was cut off before he got any further.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was talking, as a matter of fact,\\u201d the headmaster said.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout the oddity of all of this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>He\\u2019s stalling.\\xa0 He knows Fray, he knows the plan</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>Why?\\xa0 What\\u2019s he doing?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen I teach my students, I try to instill them with a certain mindset.\\xa0 Wherever they go, whoever they deal with, they can benefit from what Dame Cicely\\u2019s Academy can teach them.\\xa0 That, much as in the rule of the species, we are in constant competition-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>War?\\xa0 Was he trying to defeat an opponent, or defend himself?</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-and we wage this competition on all levels.\\xa0 For partners, for status, for reputation, for wealth-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Commerce?\\xa0 Was there a hidden profit in this?</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-and for more abstract things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ideology?\\xa0 Was he trying to <em>prove</em> something?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRadham may be an Academy, it may serve the same Crown we do, but when the Crown\\u2019s book-keepers sit down and figure out who is contributing the most, well, let\\u2019s just say that Radham might well see something to gain in coming here to sabotage us on a small level.\\xa0 Nothing too dramatic, because that could be considered treasonous, but an <em>embarrassment</em>?\\xa0 Oh, imagine that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Politics.</p>\\n<p>It was politics.\\xa0 I\\u2019d gotten through to Lady Claire by raising the topic, and Lady Claire was this man\\u2019s niece.\\xa0 He was angling for something, with the idea of raising Kensford up and bringing others down.</p>\\n<p>The irony of his words.\\xa0 He knew, and he was here, sabotaging <em>us, </em>by making us wait, keeping us from working against the problem.\\xa0 He was the one aligning for political gain in the grand scheme of things.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d worked with Fray to do it.</p>\\n<p>I had a very clear mental image of this man, Fray, Warren, and Lady Claire all sitting at the table, having a conversation, about what the future held.</p>\\n<p>Was Lady Claire the pawn in it all?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe should go,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe I wasn\\u2019t clear enough, I\\u2019ll try to explain at a level more appropriate to your age,\\u201d the headmaster said, without a trace of irony.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m suggesting that you\\u2019re spreading lies to hurt this school.\\xa0 It would be a very bad idea if we simply let you leave.\\xa0 We\\u2019d be giving you free reign to continue spreading those lies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat if we\\u2019re right?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat happens then?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man smiled, and he lied again, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stopped paying attention to the man, and started paying attention to the faculty around the room.\\xa0 Seven women and three men, and their collective attention was fixed on the headmaster, not on the strangers in the room who were supposedly spreading propaganda.</p>\\n<p>He had them in the palm of his hand.\\xa0 If he told them to lie, they would lie.\\xa0 If he told them this conversation never happened, then it would be our say-so against his, and he had clout.</p>\\n<p>A curious feeling, realizing just how busy Genevieve Fray had been.\\xa0 Had she known him from the outset?\\xa0 Had that been how she\\u2019d got her foot in the door, found the person she would tutor, with room and board?\\xa0 Fray had a powerful ally in the headmaster, and I had little doubt she\\u2019d established others at different points along the line.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re going,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He turned around, and started toward the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not going anywhere,\\u201d the headmaster said.\\xa0 He snapped his fingers, and stitched manservants headed in our direction.\\xa0 The headmaster added a quick order.\\xa0 \\u201cKeep the door closed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, we\\u2019re not going anywhere,\\u201d I said, not budging.</p>\\n<p>I saw Gordon hesitate, and in that moment, the stitched closed the distance and pushed the doors closed, before standing in the way.\\xa0 Gordon backed away and shot me a dirty look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe still has my badge,\\u201d I said, simply, pointing at the headmaster.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne of these days, I\\u2019m going to leave you behind,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet you face the consequences your own damn self.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know they can make another?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey could, but <em>that</em> one is mine.\\xa0 It belongs to me, not him,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course it does,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe could have walked out,\\u201d Gordon muttered, as he turned to face the headmaster once again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo we couldn\\u2019t,\\u201d I murmured under my breath.\\xa0 \\u201cThey would have given chase, and you and I are the only ones who can run fast enough to get away.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon made an annoyed sound, but he didn\\u2019t actively disagree.</p>\\n<p>He was probably thinking we could have put up a fight, and that it would have been worth the risk, given what was at stake.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have a space downstairs where we can hold them,\\u201d the headmaster said, \\u201cat least until a guardian or a representative from Radham comes to claim them.\\xa0 If we-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan we drop the charade?\\u201d I asked, cutting him off.</p>\\n<p>It was rude, and it was <em>intentionally</em> rude.\\xa0 We were dealing with a man who had power and was <em>used</em> to power, he commanded the respect of everyone in Kensford and the surrounding area, probably, and he considered himself invulnerable.\\xa0 Cutting a man like him off would get attention, and if I was lucky, I might be able to provoke a reaction.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t flinch.\\xa0 The man raised his eyebrows.\\xa0 \\u201cCharade?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGuess not,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThen you keep pretending, and I\\u2019m going to stand here and talk and look like a crazy person.\\xa0 You\\u2019re going to let us go, you\\u2019re not going to kick up a fuss, and you\\u2019re going to let us run damage control.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon, Mary, Jamie, and Lillian half-turned, to watch me as I talked.\\xa0 The headmaster had his allies, and he had more, but I had the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs this where the threats to my life start?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m threatening your livelihood.\\xa0 If you want to make this a contest between Radham and Dame Cicely\\u2019s Academy, then we\\u2019re content playing hardball.\\xa0 Let me see if I\\u2019ve got this right.\\xa0 Fray tells you that she\\u2019s got a plan.\\xa0 She\\u2019s already laid the groundwork in other cities.\\xa0 You facilitate her activities, you connect her to Claire, under the guise of Fray manipulating your niece, clearing your niece of blame, and Fray puts her plan into motion here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He had a good poker face.\\xa0 It was somewhat infuriating.\\xa0 I wanted to hurt him, if only to break the facade.\\xa0 My frustration at having to let Fray go might have been coloring my perceptions.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe told Lady Claire that she was going to help the Academy\\u2026 and the only way that makes sense is if it\\u2019s the <em>Academy\\u2019s</em> plan.\\xa0 The Academy\\u2019s formula or strategy or whatever else, and it\\u2019s not a thing that the common people are going to be happy with.\\xa0 When the people rise up, Radham suffers, but <em>your</em> locals, they have money, or they have parents with money.\\xa0 The problem gets fixed.\\xa0 You come up looking like roses, and many of the other Academies struggle.\\xa0 Your competitors struggle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shifted position slightly, a faint rise of his chin, to look down on me more.</p>\\n<p>There were tells that were blatant, the folding of arms when a person felt attacked, and there were tells that stood out because a person who knew the art of body language and deception was trying so very hard to avoid giving a tell that they moved in the <em>opposite</em> direction.\\xa0 This was the latter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour mistake is thinking we\\u2019re going to blame Fray for this,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 This time, <em>I</em> lied, and I was a far more committed liar than him.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ve already put out word to various institutions to say that we don\\u2019t want anyone to raise an alert over Fray.\\xa0 We\\u2019re keeping things on the down-low, because she almost certainly has some spies and moles in the Academy, tipping her off.\\xa0 She\\u2019s a non-entity, and it\\u2019s easier to pretend she doesn\\u2019t exist than it is to spread word of her.\\xa0 If this happens, Radham puts the blame squarely at your feet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019d let a fugitive get away with this hypothetical mass-poisoning, simply to make my life a little more inconvenient?\\u201d the headmaster asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamn straight,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Mary nodded, beside me.</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s already slipped away, and this frankly fits her pattern.\\xa0 I\\u2019d lay odds she wants you to take the hit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t believe you,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p><em>Typical.\\xa0 </em><em>Person in power, so used to having his way, he can\\u2019t conceive of a world where things don\\u2019t go the way he wants them to.</em></p>\\n<p>I shook my head, \\u201cI don\\u2019t believe that a person can be in your position and not appreciate the human capacity for <em>spite</em>.\\xa0 If we tell Radham that you did this at their expense, they\\u2019ll come after you.\\xa0 You might be small with some real clout, but Radham is <em>big</em>.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll destroy your reputation, and then they\\u2019ll come after your subordinates, and then they\\u2019ll come after your school, your <em>legacy</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut if you want to try us,\\u201d Gordon said, folding his arms, \\u201cArrest us.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s wait this out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We stood there, waiting.</p>\\n<p>The man didn\\u2019t flinch, he didn\\u2019t show a sign of doubt.</p>\\n<p>I started to wonder if he\\u2019d physically altered his face or nerves to have better control over it all, to hide his tells and more precisely manage the face he presented to the world.</p>\\n<p>A full minute passed, and he didn\\u2019t give the order to arrest us.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d brought up his subordinates for a reason.\\xa0 I knew he was aware of their gaze, their worries.\\xa0 He had control over them, but he didn\\u2019t necessarily have their trust.\\xa0 They would help him commit an atrocity, and cover up the fact that he\\u2019d worked with a terrorist to do it, but when push came to shove, they couldn\\u2019t trust him to genuinely care about them.</p>\\n<p>Or so I hoped.\\xa0 More to the point, I hoped that <em>he</em> was insecure about whether they trusted him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cArresting you would be a hassle, honestly,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t want you here any longer.\\xa0 I was kind enough to provide accommodations, with the idea that you would be passing through.\\xa0 Please\\u2026 <em>pass through.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gestured, and the stitched at the door moved away.</p>\\n<p>Gordon hauled the doors open.\\xa0 I remained where I was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy badge,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI swear, if you don\\u2019t get moving, I\\u2019m going to run you up a flagpole and leave you <em>hanging</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe badge, headmaster,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 When he didn\\u2019t make a sign of moving, I added, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve established that spite isn\\u2019t any small thing.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t make unnecessary enemies.\\xa0 You\\u2019re a very short distance from being on <em>everyone\\u2019s </em>bad side.\\xa0 Fray\\u2019s scapegoat, the person who let down your Academy, the person who sold out his niece, and Radham\\u2019s whipping boy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have what you want, free reign to leave.\\xa0 Are you throwing it away to offend my pride?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe badge,\\u201d I said, not budging.</p>\\n<p>He tossed the badge at me, so it would fall just short.\\xa0 I stepped forward and caught it, all the same.\\xa0 I liked the weight of it in my hand, and took a second to flip it closed and slip it into a pocket.</p>\\n<p>We turned and left, striding through the school.\\xa0 Mary leaned heavily on my shoulder, which wasn\\u2019t welcome, though it was understandable.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have an idea of what Fray is doing?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo share,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He sounded a little miffed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike I said, it\\u2019s something Kensford can bounce back from, because Kensford has money.\\xa0 It\\u2019s something that\\u2019s going to enrage people, and it\\u2019s going to hit places that aren\\u2019t Kensford hard.\\xa0 It\\u2019s going to <em>hurt</em>, given Fray\\u2019s feelings toward the Academy, and at the end of the day, it was something the Academy was planning to do <em>anyway</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cControl,\\u201d I said, simply.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s what any power wants, in the end.\\xa0 Control of everything.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was no need to elaborate.\\xa0 We all knew about the Academy\\u2019s methods of control.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere does she go to spread the word?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe dining hall,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s eating dinner.\\xa0 Everyone\\u2019s talking as a group.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It hadn\\u2019t been my first instinct, with so many people around, but Fray was a bird of a feather here, a needle in a haystack.</p>\\n<p>If it was the dining hall, then it might well be too late.</p>\\n<p>Our brisk walk became a run.\\xa0 Jamie gave directions.\\xa0 When our battered Mary proved too slow, then he took over, willingly lagging behind, while Gordon, Lillian and I headed to the room.</p>\\n<p>The hubub of conversation had a <em>tone</em>.\\xa0 Quiet, subdued, and concerned.\\xa0 Even horrified.</p>\\n<p>The girls were gathered in groups, one or two to a table, huddled, talking, their focus on pieces of paper, one or two papers to a group.</p>\\n<p>This was the heart of the city.\\xa0 All things flowed to and from it.\\xa0 The substance that had been put into the water, the people, and now information.</p>\\n<p>That information was as damning as anything else.</p>\\n<p>Gordon approached a group, and he took one of the pieces of paper.\\xa0 He read some of it as he approached us, handing it over to share.\\xa0 It had been printed in large numbers by way of a printing press.\\xa0 Something Fray had seen to in a previous city, no doubt.</p>\\n<p>Control.\\xa0 An attack on two fronts, both things the Academy had planned over the long term, no doubt things that had been intended to be slipped past the public\\u2019s notice when the time was right, when distractions were imminent, or an excuse available.</p>\\n<p>The papers described the process by which men and women who imbibed the chemical would be rendered sterile.</p>\\n<p><em>Control over reproduction and population</em>.</p>\\n<p>The process would be reversible, but those were keys that the Academy held, to be provided on a case-by-case basis.</p>\\n<p>The other form of attack was one we were too familiar with.\\xa0 We\\u2019d been subjected to it, once upon a time.\\xa0 For most of the population, the effect would be minor \\u2013 Fray hadn\\u2019t had the time to give them too heavy a dose, but some of the fat chains that made up the cell walls would be composed of the modified kind, found in the water.\\xa0 Left alone, they would collapse, and cells would die.\\xa0 Sensitive tissues of the brain, lungs, stomach and mucous membranes would the first to go.\\xa0 Symptoms would progress through pain, full-body bruising, system failure, internal bleeding, fatigue and weakness, and eventually lead to an unpleasant, undignified death.</p>\\n<p>The symptoms would be staved off by continuing to drink the water, but continuing to drink the water would perpetuate the problem.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t understand,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Academy can\\u2019t fix it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey can,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey won\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s too much.\\xa0 People aren\\u2019t going to take it lying down,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Academy has a way to stop it, to cure the effects, don\\u2019t they?\\xa0 They just say Fray did it, and they put out a fix, and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey won\\u2019t,\\u201d I said, again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t say that for sure,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>My eyes roved over the crowd.\\xa0 The horror, the <em>anger</em>.\\xa0 I could already see distinctions forming.\\xa0 Different groups with different reactions.\\xa0 Some were shocked, as anyone might be, but they weren\\u2019t <em>scared</em>.\\xa0 People with money, raised to believe that any problem could be fixed.\\xa0 Especially those of the human body.</p>\\n<p>But there were others.\\xa0 People who didn\\u2019t have as much money, those who weren\\u2019t sure they were in a position to buy a solution to the problem, <em>buy</em> the ability to have children and a way to move freely.\\xa0 A way to move freely that likely involved bottles of purple pills.\\xa0 These members of Dame Cicely\\u2019s student body were closer to the population on the ground, the farmers and craftsmen, the wagon-drivers and grocers.\\xa0 They were angrier, more frightened, louder.</p>\\n<p><em>She told us</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>Fray teased us with the pills.\\xa0 All along, it was her plan</em>.</p>\\n<p>There was an undercurrent of disbelief, as if this were a joke in particularly bad taste.</p>\\n<p>That would change.\\xa0 This was a school of students.\\xa0 Those students would do tests, and they would verify this for themselves.\\xa0 The reaction after that would be terrible to behold.</p>\\n<p>Things would be bad here, but<em> Radham\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>Subjecting the regular population to the chemical leash, not just the experiments?\\xa0 Denying a small city\\u2019s residents the ability to have children without the permission of the Academy and the Crown?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid she do this in Radham?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe would have done it everywhere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat means we have to go back,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSoon.\\xa0 This is too big, and there\\u2019s no guarantee we\\u2019ll be able to get back if we wait.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>The train drivers drank the water too.</em></p>\\n<p>The ramifications were too broad.\\xa0 I clenched my fist.\\xa0 It was true.\\xa0 At any point in time, Fray could have simply <em>told</em> us, and we would have had no choice but to go back.</p>\\n<p>When none of us spoke, Gordon added, gently, \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing more we can do here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re right,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We left the dining hall much as we\\u2019d entered, at a brisk pace.</p>\\n<p>There were things to take care of.\\xa0 We needed Helen, of course, and then there was Wendy.</p>\\n<p>We stepped outdoors.\\xa0 A whole crowd of students was heading toward the school.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d heard.\\xa0 They were coming to read those same papers.</p>\\n<p>We headed in a different direction, before they could trample us.\\xa0 One out of every four faces was <em>haunted, </em>they\\u2019d heard, they knew how the Academy operated, and they grasped the ramifications.</p>\\n<p>It would sink in with the rest soon.\\xa0 They would contact their parents, and the rich and powerful who had sent their daughters to Dame Cicely\\u2019s would take issue.\\xa0 The headmaster would pacify and massage his way back into good graces with promises of fixes or temporary solutions.</p>\\n<p>It wouldn\\u2019t be pretty, but he\\u2019d come out looking good.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was the guy\\u2019s name?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThe headmaster?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We crossed a road, and our heads collectively turned to look further down the street, where a number of people who most definitely weren\\u2019t students were gathered outside a church.\\xa0 The shouts were audible, the anger apparent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe told you his name,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHeadmaster Edmund Foss.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t remember that,\\u201d I admitted.</p>\\n<p>The shouts rose in volume.</p>\\n<p>I looked, studying the crowd, but I didn\\u2019t see Reverend Mauer.\\xa0 Churches were bastions of community, and in the midst of this growing crisis, they were becoming rallying points.\\xa0 Not an idea exclusive to Mauer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChrist,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is only just starting?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s going to be war,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p><em>War</em>.</p>\\n<p>She was right.\\xa0 Mauer had tapped into the public\\u2019s fears and resentment, but this was something else altogether.\\xa0 The man would be having a field day, wherever he was.</p>\\n<p>War, the people against the Academy, with everything that entailed.\\xa0 The weapons, the monsters, the crude attempts at handling the finer, more delicate matters.</p>\\n<p>How odd, now that I thought about it.\\xa0 With the chemicals in the water, adjusted to affect <em>everyone</em>, we would have free reign.\\xa0 The leash had been given a considerable amount of slack, and it was thanks to Fray.</p>\\n<p>Gordon slowed.\\xa0 I spotted the reason why.</p>\\n<p>Further down the street, the giant of a man with incredible blue eyes.\\xa0 Warren.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t charge, and he didn\\u2019t attack.</p>\\n<p>He was so <em>close.</em>\\xa0 Did he know where Helen and Wendy were?</p>\\n<p>How odd, that he looked so calm, standing in the snow, as the rest of the city grew so heated and noisome.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou want your stitched friend,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Warren nodded, the blue eyes bobbing in the dark.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can negotiate,\\u201d Gordon said, and his smile was a grim one.</p>\\n<p>Again, Warren nodded.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/07/25/enemy-arc-4/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Just an hour or so ago, Fray had been giving the order for Warren to attack us, to kill or maim.\\xa0 Now we were following Warren to where Fray was waiting.\\xa0 A little upriver from where we\\u2019d had our first discussion, near the edge of Kensford, where it bordered the woods.</p>\\n<p>There was a crowd further down the street.\\xa0 They were moving toward the Academy with purpose, and we could hear the shouts, though I couldn\\u2019t make out the words.</p>\\n<p>Fray looked genuinely surprised when we turned up.\\xa0 More surprised than she\\u2019d been when we\\u2019d turned up near her lab.\\xa0 She raised one hand to move her hair away from her face, as the wind blew it forcefully in the most inconvenient direction.</p>\\n<p>It took her a second.\\xa0 Something fell into place, and she nodded a little.\\xa0 \\u201cYou found them, Warren, and you brought them here, because of Wendy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you don\\u2019t catch a train soon, you\\u2019re going to be stuck here,\\u201d Fray informed us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Now</em> you\\u2019re being manipulative,\\u201d I said, walking up with my hands in my coat pockets.\\xa0 I separated from the group and found a tree with a short stone wall built around it to contain the dirt, taking a seat on the corner of the wall, one foot propped up, the other on the ground.\\xa0 \\u201cSetting a time limit?\\xa0 That\\u2019s number one in the manipulation textbook.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She shook her head.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat is it they say about a thief being wariest of theft?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI never liked that saying.\\xa0 Thieves deal with thieves as a matter of course.\\xa0 If I\\u2019m going to steal, I\\u2019m going to steal from a thief who can\\u2019t go to authorities to complain.\\xa0 It stands to reason that a thief is well justified in being wary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re missing the point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI get the point.\\xa0 I\\u2019m a manipulator dealing with manipulators.\\xa0 And a manipulator is particularly vulnerable to the predations of their cannier counterparts.\\xa0 But okay, if you want to pretend you\\u2019re not setting an artificial time limit to put pressure on us and position yourself better for getting Wendy back, I can play along.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The other Lambs were taking my lead, spreading out, very casually.\\xa0 This encounter with Fray was very different from the last one, and very different from my first encounter with her.\\xa0 We\\u2019d lost.\\xa0 She\\u2019d dropped her bombshell, and now, oddly enough, we could relax.</p>\\n<p>The shouts and screams further down the street rose in volume.\\xa0 People had torches, which was almost laughable.\\xa0 It was so iconic for the angry mob, but now that I saw it, I wondered if they intended to set fires, or if they simply needed the light.\\xa0 How did that even happen?\\xa0 Did someone have a supply of torches on hand, or did one guy just pipe up and say \\u2018I know how to make torches!\\xa0 Just give me a few minutes!\\u2019</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re smiling,\\u201d Fray spoke to me.</p>\\n<p>I raised my eyebrows, the smile disappearing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you have a plan, Sylvester?\\xa0 A way to snare me?\\xa0 One of you is missing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was Gordon who replied.\\xa0 \\u201cNo plan to capture, no snare.\\xa0 Whatever we did, you have Warren, and he could hurt or kill several of us in retaliation for whatever we did to you.\\xa0 Not worth it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fray nodded.\\xa0 It was common sense, really \\u2013 Warren wouldn\\u2019t have brought us if he thought it would hurt Fray.\\xa0 It said something, though, that she\\u2019d asked, bringing things up to sound it out and gauge our reactions.\\xa0 A hint of insecurity.</p>\\n<p>If I had to reason it out, I suspected we\\u2019d shocked her a little by appearing in the school and forcing her hand.\\xa0 Forcing her to use Warren, and forcing her to put her plan into action.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you satisfied?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll see,\\u201d Fray said, leaning back against the railing that overlooked the river.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m more interested in the long-term.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been at this since you left the detainment center with Warren and Wendy,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cHave I?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon spoke, saying, \\u201cIt\\u2019s done.\\xa0 You won, you don\\u2019t have to be coy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t just outright tell you the particulars.\\xa0 I could lie, but I don\\u2019t like doing that.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll both see how far the ripples extend in the coming weeks and months.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWar,\\u201d Mary said, quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cThere has to be.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think so,\\u201d Fray agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Academy crossed lines.\\xa0 I wanted to change it from within, that didn\\u2019t work, so I\\u2019m going to force a change from the outside.\\xa0 War is one way.\\xa0 Changing minds is another.\\xa0 There are weak points in the economic backbone, there are weaknesses in the foundations of the Academy\\u2019s work\\u2026 that last one might be a weakness I\\u2019m not clever enough to exploit, I have to admit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you tell us all this with the idea that we\\u2019re going to go back and tell Radham Academy what you said, down to the word,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI expect you will, Jamie,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you\\u2019re leaving out the next part.\\xa0 You\\u2019re only getting started,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYour <em>real</em> method of attack isn\\u2019t one of the ones you just described.\\xa0 You want us to go and we tell Hayle or Briggs what you said-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou mean the duke, not Briggs,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>I raised my eyebrows.\\xa0 \\u201cFunny that you know that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not exactly a secret,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cYou want us to go to Hayle or <em>the duke</em>, listing off all those different ways you could hurt the Academy, and when they\\u2019ve busied themselves frantically working to cover all the bases, you attack us from another angle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She shook her head, \\u201cOr I expect you\\u2019ll say that and I use one of the methods I just named.\\xa0 The Academy is too big.\\xa0 Something has to give.\\xa0 You know full well that you each have expiration dates \\u2013 Sy wasn\\u2019t surprised when I brought it up.\\xa0 The Academies are an experiment of sorts too.\\xa0 Just as they\\u2019ve done with you, they\\u2019re going to keep pushing until something breaks, and then they\\u2019ll change things, approach anew with learned lessons fresh in their minds.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not saying this is a dragon that can be slain.\\xa0 I am saying that it can be <em>trained</em>.\\xa0 Even if we\\u2019re on opposite sides, you can\\u2019t disagree with me on that score.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWant to try us?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>Man, Mary was in a bad mood.</p>\\n<p>Odd, considering the fact that I felt <em>fantastic</em>.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t happy, exactly, but I\\u2019d become caught up in Fray\\u2019s flow.\\xa0 Stagnation was the worst thing, and <em>change</em> was something thrilling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re smiling again, Sylvester,\\u201d Genevieve Fray told me.\\xa0 \\u201cMy mental picture of you told me you\\u2019d be more upset.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t cry over spilled milk,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are better things to occupy my thoughts with.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe forced sterilization and enslavement of tens or hundreds of thousands is spilled milk?\\u201d Lillian asked, quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cClose enough,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe went into this a step behind.\\xa0 You had the files on us, Fray, you knew who you were dealing with.\\xa0 You have moles on the inside who are feeding you information and telling you we\\u2019re coming.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomeone could read that as you being a sore loser, Sylvester,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe eluded you, so there <em>must</em> be a mole?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m thinking you know entirely too much, and you know far too much that\\u2019s up to date, like about the Duke and the fact that Mary is a Lamb.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe was a Lamb in the spring, when I was introduced to your file.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA <em>new</em> Lamb, with no guarantee she would work out.\\xa0 You didn\\u2019t know her full capabilities, but you weren\\u2019t surprised when she turned up or demonstrated her abilities.\\xa0 Everything fits better if I assume you have someone in the Academy, passing on details.\\xa0 An ex-classmate or teacher?\\xa0 There are a lot of possibilities, especially for a would-be professor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave to make connections to make it up the ladder,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you told me you took the Wyvern formula to build up your ability to play the political game.\\xa0 You\\u2019re telling me you didn\\u2019t cover that base?\\xa0 Come <em>on,</em>\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Fray shrugged, smiling some.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou had this decided long before we arrived,\\u201d I said, feeling very at ease.\\xa0 \\u201cYou had the information on us, and we didn\\u2019t have the information on you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey would have showed you my file.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe file that doesn\\u2019t even mention that you were taking the Wyvern formula until it comes up in the your record of termination?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYour files on us were better than our files on you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs far as I\\u2019m concerned,\\u201d I said, \\u201cThis was an introduction.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve said our hellos, we\\u2019ve gotten to know each other, just a little bit, Fray, Warren and Wendy meeting the Lambs, and we\\u2019re going to meet again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope it\\u2019s soon,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe offer for conversation and tea stands.\\xa0 So does the offer to leave the Academy.\\xa0 We can work on the expiration dates, I can save Jamie-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop,\\u201d Gordon said, voice hard.\\xa0 Jamie flinched \\u2013 I wasn\\u2019t sure if it was because of Fray\\u2019s words or Gordon\\u2019s reaction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd I obviously have the means to free you from the chemical leash,\\u201d she finished, as if she hadn\\u2019t been interrupted.\\xa0 \\u201cI feel like I have to ask again, with most of you present, in light of recent events.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow that you\\u2019ve \\u2018won\\u2019,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re offering us a spot on the winning side?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t phrase it like that, but yes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a long pause.\\xa0 Warren shifted position uncomfortably.\\xa0 The shouting further down the street was coming and going, but it wasn\\u2019t the same group \\u2013 people were migrating en-masse, either to Dame Cicely\\u2019s or away from it.</p>\\n<p>Odd that people could be going in such different directions and be so similar in how they were thinking.</p>\\n<p>That thought in mind, I spoke up, simply to say, \\u201cI\\u2019ve already given you my answer.\\xa0 No.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a believer,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m a skeptic.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething like that,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t entice you by saying that my way is the harder road?\\u201d she asked, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s more <em>interesting.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHearing you say that is pretty telling,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI almost believe you now when you say that you\\u2019re not good at manipulating people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m staying with the Academy,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>Fray nodded, accepting that, but she spoke, \\u201cEven knowing that you might never get another chance to leave?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw Jamie tense at that.\\xa0 Even with his winter clothes on, mittened hands holding his book, I could see the subtle change in body language.</p>\\n<p>Lillian looked anxious.\\xa0 She kept looking back between Jamie and Genevieve Fray.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s how it works, isn\\u2019t it?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 \\u201cSooner or later, you can\\u2019t know for sure when, they\\u2019ll keep what you give them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I clenched my hands in my pockets.\\xa0 This was more convincing than anything she had said to me, specifically.\\xa0 This was <em>Jamie</em>.\\xa0 She was completely and utterly right.</p>\\n<p>Jamie couldn\\u2019t be saved, not exactly, but instead of having another year or two with him, I could have six.\\xa0 Or <em>ten</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf any of us leave, they take someone else and replace us.\\xa0 Same idea, another child,\\u201d Jamie said, his voice soft.</p>\\n<p>Fray nodded.\\xa0 She smiled a little.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s so nice to finally <em>meet</em> you.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t imagined you\\u2019d be the compassionate sort.\\xa0 I thought you\\u2019d be more stiff.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie shook his head, but he didn\\u2019t say anything.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary?\\u201d Fray asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo rationale, no points to debate?\\u201d Fray asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 You disgust me, I don\\u2019t like you.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t like standing here, being in your company.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t imagine staying with you for a while on purpose, unless it\\u2019s to take you somewhere where they can put you down,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh my.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m a Lamb,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Fray nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cGordon?\\xa0 Lillian?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian was the one who answered.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have nothing to give me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could teach you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo can they,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 Simple, firm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne-on-one, dedicated-\\u201d Fray started.\\xa0 She stopped as she saw Lillian shaking her head.\\xa0 \\u201cNo?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI saw what you did with Lady Claire,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have nothing to offer that I\\u2019d want to take.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think you even understand the ramifications of what you did.\\xa0 People are going to die.\\xa0 Lots of them, <em>innocents.\\xa0 </em>People who drank this water and left the city?\\xa0 Those who were just passing through?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPeople will get hurt,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut the effects are diluted, they\\u2019ll have a few days.\\xa0 The Academy will respond and get a stopgap measure into place.\\xa0 Crateloads of pills or train cars of the fluids will go out in every direction.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPeople will die,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou said it yourself, there are no guarantees the trains will keep running.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy can\\u2019t fix the problem.\\xa0 A simple remedy for the effects of sterilization and the controlling agent would go against their very ethos.\\xa0 They <em>have</em> to take control where it\\u2019s offered.\\xa0 To survive this, they have to minimize the casualties.\\xa0 I guarantee you, Lillian, the Academy will find a way to distribute a stopgap measure.\\xa0 One that lets them keep this system of control in place, however much it hurts them to keep hold of the reins.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian shook her head.</p>\\n<p>I thought the debate between the two of them might have continued, but Gordon jumped in, and when he did, my heart skipped a beat.</p>\\n<p>I could read his body language.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI talked to Sy about it earlier,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p><em>No, Gordon</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told him, if you made the offer to me, I\\u2019d accept.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart leaped into my throat.</p>\\n<p>No.\\xa0 I was <em>not</em> prepared to lose a Lamb like this.\\xa0 Not so soon.</p>\\n<p>As Lillian had done earlier, I looked between Fray and Gordon, suddenly alarmed.</p>\\n<p>I saw the shock on Fray\\u2019s face, too, fleeting, before she masked it.\\xa0 As Gordon was wont to do, he\\u2019d put her off balance.\\xa0 He had a way of hitting where it hurt.</p>\\n<p>I saw the brief communication of ideas between them.\\xa0 Him reading her body language, her reading his.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s changed, I think,\\u201d Gordon finally said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe way you did this\\u2026 it\\u2019s not a fight I\\u2019d want to participate in.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d- when it comes to you, I don\\u2019t think-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She found the words he was reaching for.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t think you\\u2019d have faith in me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot after this,\\u201d Gordon said, very simply.\\xa0 I could hear the lie in the words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt goes both ways.\\xa0 If only one Lamb joined me, I feel like it would have to be a double-cross,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd it wouldn\\u2019t if <em>all</em> of us joined you?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you were in a position to do that, it would be closer to an ambush than a double-cross,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>She was distracting, turning the subject away from Gordon.\\xa0 I could see him staring at her.</p>\\n<p>The two of them had communicated so much in mere moments.\\xa0 He\\u2019d seen that she wasn\\u2019t ready.\\xa0 Maybe she expected me to jump on board, or she had ideas on how to use Jamie.\\xa0 Or maybe she had anticipated that when one domino toppled, the rest would, and the Lambs would join her wholesale.\\xa0 If we were all on board, then we\\u2019d stay on board to stay <em>together.\\xa0 </em>Our earlier discussion on the subject had suggested that we were a package deal, after all.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t know for sure.\\xa0 The interplay had been between them alone.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to say something, to joke, to step in between them.\\xa0 I found my throat tight, the words didn\\u2019t come.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s talk about Wendy,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think we have a train to catch, so let\\u2019s not drag this out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw Warren shift position.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have something in mind?\\u201d Fray asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to turn myself in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been thinking about it, what we could do in the way of transactions, things you might agree to.\\xa0 My first thought was that you should dismiss Warren.\\xa0 Let the guy get some help.\\xa0 He can have Wendy back, it\\u2019s clear they care about each other, he can heal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd I\\u2019m left without my friend?\\u201d Fray asked us.</p>\\n<p>I found words, though I had to clear my throat to get them through.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you refuse, you might lose him anyway.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren folded his arms, drawing attention to him.\\xa0 He shook his head in a slow, dramatic fashion.</p>\\n<p><em>Or not</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe second option, and this is one I think you could agree to, while keeping it meaningful,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cYou take a time out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA time out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne year, you don\\u2019t pull anything else.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t attack the Academies, you don\\u2019t perpetuate your plans, you don\\u2019t form allies, you don\\u2019t research for your next scheme.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fray frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cThat kind of adjustment was not in the cards.\\xa0 It\\u2019s unreasonable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes Warren think so?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been watching the big guy.\\xa0 I imagined she was thinking a lot about what she might be able to do if he picked a fight with us.</p>\\n<p>Warren didn\\u2019t budge.\\xa0 He was frozen.\\xa0 Not offering any tells was a tell in this case.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t see it as unreasonable.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree months,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t attack anyone or unleash anything.\\xa0 I <em>can</em> gather allies and do research.\\xa0 I have to, frankly, it would be disingenuous to say otherwise.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSix months,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Fray didn\\u2019t look that happy with the idea.\\xa0 \\u201cFour months.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSix,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA good compromise is something that makes everyone unhappy,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Fray gave me an unimpressed look.</p>\\n<p><em>She had plans.\\xa0 This throws a wrench into them.\\xa0 It gives the Academy a chance to recover\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>Not much, not enough to undo what she did.\\xa0 Not with possible civil war on the horizon.</p>\\n<p>But enough to hurt her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA stitched in exchange for time,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething like that,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d offer a handshake to seal the deal,\\u201d Fray said, \\u201cBut I\\u2019m not positive you wouldn\\u2019t break my leg if I let you get that close.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know about your retractable needles,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSy recapped.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s do without the handshake.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cUntil we meet again, then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUntil we meet again,\\u201d I said, before Gordon could say it.</p>\\n<p>I turned to leave, with only Jamie in my field of vision, only Jamie able to see my expression.</p>\\n<p>Gordon had been willing to go.\\xa0 It hadn\\u2019t been a trick, no joke, no double-cross.\\xa0 He was the most mature and independent of us, he was the one who felt his mortality, and apparently that outweighed his loyalty to <em>us</em>.</p>\\n<p>If he\\u2019d replied to say something about their next meeting, I wasn\\u2019t sure if I could have kept from reacting or saying something.</p>\\n<p>The next time they met, if something drastic didn\\u2019t change, Gordon would go with her.</p>\\n<p>I twisted around, avoiding looking at Gordon, instead fixating on the woman who was still leaning against the railing, rubbing her hands to keep them warm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll be here.\\xa0 Send Wendy down this street.\\xa0 But you should leave soon.\\xa0 If the proverbial fires don\\u2019t ignite, then I\\u2019m going to start some, and you won\\u2019t want to be here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs the headmaster going to be okay with you starting fires?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>Genevieve offered him a coy smile.</p>\\n<p><em>Bastard deserves what he gets, then</em>.</p>\\n<p>We left to go get Helen and take our leave from Kensford.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The train came to a stop.\\xa0 Not Radham, a smaller town.\\xa0 I watched out the window as the conductor made his way down the steps to approach a man.\\xa0 My eye traveled to a number of stitched guards at the entrance to the train station.\\xa0 A surprisingly large number.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Was that smoke coming from within the town?\\xa0 Were actual fires being started?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The conductor hurried up the stairs.\\xa0 He addressed the crowd of people at the end of the train car, who were just collecting bags from the rack, or bidding stitched servants to do the collecting.\\xa0 There was a murmur of conversation, hushed and tense.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Among the Lambs, we exchanged glances.\\xa0 I averted my eyes from Gordon alone.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Only half of the passengers left.\\xa0 We watched and waited as the others went to return to their seats, looking anxious.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We were silent even as the conductor approached us, bending down low in that way adults so often did with children.\\xa0 His voice was low.\\xa0 \\u201cA few problems have come up.\\xa0 You were getting off at Radham, I believe?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We nodded as a group.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe man at the station says that word has come down the wire that a few of the cities and towns along our route are in crisis.\\xa0 Do you know what that means?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe know what that means,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYes, well\\u2026\\u201d the conductor paused.\\xa0 \\u201cPinesam, Evensroy, Radham and Berricksville are rioting, on fire, experiments were unleashed, or a combination of the three.\\xa0 If you\\u2019d like, we\\u2019ll drop you off somewhere safer, the railroad will help you make accommodations and get in touch with anyone vital.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThere\\u2019s no need,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe have to get off at Radham.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf you\\u2019re sure?\\xa0 The situation sounds dire.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019re sure,\\u201d Gordon said, in a way that brooked no argument.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cTake care, children,\\u201d the conductor said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A moment later, he had moved on to the next grouping of seats.\\xa0 He recited the same list of cities, informing passengers about the situation.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A full minute passed before Lillian spoke up, \\u201cAm I just crazy, or-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe didn\\u2019t visit Pinesam or Evensroy,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAre we sure?\\xa0 Because-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe didn\\u2019t,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary was turning a knife over in her hands.\\xa0 I double checked that none of the train staff or other passengers were in a position to see, then left her to it.\\xa0 We all had little quirks when we were stressed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe already knew she made friends along the way,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When we returned to Radham, it took a full fifteen minutes for them to let us in the front door.\\xa0 It hadn\\u2019t been easy, with all the people pressing to get in, pushing and shoving to get us out of the way and be the ones to voice their rage and sorrow.</p>\\n<p>Five minutes of walking to get to the head office.\\xa0 Lonely, with almost no souls out and about.\\xa0 Everyone who was awake was elsewhere, working or hiding.</p>\\n<p>Once we\\u2019d reached it, we were left to wait for a full thirty minutes.\\xa0 The ominous ticking of a clock further down the hallway helped to mark the passage of time.\\xa0 It was very orderly, stiff, and calm.</p>\\n<p>In stark contrast, we had a view over the Academy walls, looking out on the sprawl of Radham.\\xa0 Fires burned here and there, and bodies moved throughout the streets, black and red in contrast to a city that otherwise gleamed the silver-blue of a city in winter.\\xa0 The sun was only beginning to rise, now.</p>\\n<p>We were given glasses of water by a student, and I stared long and hard at it before drinking.\\xa0 I thought of Fray.</p>\\n<p>I still couldn\\u2019t look at Gordon, and I knew he\\u2019d noticed.\\xa0 He knew me and I knew him well enough that we both knew why.\\xa0 We could communicate on that level just like he could with Fray.\\xa0 In my restlessness, I\\u2019d stood and paced away from the others, walked down the hall to look out other windows and see my city on fire from a variety of angles.</p>\\n<p>Gordon could have stood and approached, he could have said something, made excuses, shared his thoughts, and I might have forgiven him.</p>\\n<p>So ironic, considering he\\u2019d been the one to spout words about the cohesion of the team.</p>\\n<p>The rest of us were better now.\\xa0 We\\u2019d reaffirmed our bonds in standing against Fray.\\xa0 Any fractures were better.\\xa0 Except for Gordon.</p>\\n<p>It made me feel sick, it made me angry, it made me feel <em>helpless</em>, and I hated feeling helpless.</p>\\n<p>When Hayle finally stepped out of the room, I practically wheeled on him, as if I was ready to attack.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSee to your appointments,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll debrief you individually, before, during, or after you\\u2019ve been looked to.\\xa0 I have other things to focus on.\\xa0 Helen?\\xa0 You\\u2019ll find Ibbott in the Bowels.\\xa0 Lillian, go get some rest.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll send someone to let you know where you\\u2019re needed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>With that, he closed the door in our faces.</p>\\n<p>It was, coming from a man who had a way of being composed, something of a shock.</p>\\n<p>We broke away, Lillian and Helen breaking away.</p>\\n<p>Gordon walked alone, not with us, and he walked faster, leaving us behind.</p>\\n<p>I exchanged looks with Mary and Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d Mary asked quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cDid I-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t you,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe failed.\\xa0\\xa0<em>I</em> failed.\\xa0 If I hadn\\u2019t gotten hurt, if I could have gotten the drop on them, or hunted them after-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike I told Fray, this was our introduction.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll see her again.\\xa0 This time we know who and what she is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be okay?\\xa0 With your appointment?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I felt less apprehensive about it than ever, oddly enough.\\xa0 Dealing with Fray had changed my perspective in some small ways.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to go,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I raised an eyebrow.\\xa0 Mary didn\\u2019t want to go, when she <em>loved</em> her appointments.\\xa0 They were a chance to show off, to show her coordination, skill retention, fitness\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould it be better if you were in a room near ours?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>Mary, as a new addition, had her appointments in the tower, but she was on a different floor than we were.</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cFeels dumb when you say it out loud, though.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHur hur,\\u201d Jamie said, speaking in a \\u2018dumb\\u2019 deeper voice.</p>\\n<p>She reached past me to give him a playful shove, bumping me in the process.</p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019s lonely, and she doesn\\u2019t like a \\u2018loss\\u2019</em>.\\xa0 <em>She senses something\\u2019s wrong, and she wants to be part of the group, in the midst of it</em>.</p>\\n<p>She was a Lamb, through and through.</p>\\n<p>When she reached past me to swat at Jamie\\u2019s ponytail, or to pull the string from around the base, I put an arm around her.\\xa0 She stopped, a little confused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a hug, dum-dum,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHalf of one, anyway.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have knives, Sy,\\u201d she said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t get to call someone dum-dum when they have knives.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>But she was smiling.\\xa0 She messed up my hair.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I watched as she took the side hallway, heading to her lab.\\xa0 Jamie gave her a wave.</p>\\n<p>I saw how Jamie walked, the way he held his book.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe didn\\u2019t ask how you felt about <em>your</em> appointment,\\u201d I noted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNope.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not being poisoned, though.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you want me to sit and wait?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t respond right away, but I did see a nod out of the corner of my eye.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can do that,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p><em>Fray got to him.\\xa0 Talking about the dangers.</em></p>\\n<p>We reached Jamie\\u2019s laboratory.\\xa0 Project Caterpillar.</p>\\n<p>I took the book as he handed it to me.</p>\\n<p>The doctors were already waiting, and they flocked to him as he entered the room.\\xa0 I remained in the doorway, watching, too far away to make out words in the jumble of voices, hugging his book to my chest</p>\\n<p>Jamie disrobed.\\xa0 He pulled off his sweater and the shirt beneath, then unbuttoned his belt.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t that he felt so casual about his nudity here, but more that there was no choice.</p>\\n<p>The scars and the ridges carried down his entire body.\\xa0 They were more pronounced along his spine and between his legs, to the point that there was nothing left that was even remotely recognizable.</p>\\n<p>He half-turned, seeing me looking, and he didn\\u2019t flinch, he didn\\u2019t hide.\\xa0 He handed one doctor his glasses, and undid his ponytail.</p>\\n<p>Switches were flicked.\\xa0 Lights went on around the room.\\xa0 Large glass containers were lit up, with gray-pink blobs within.\\xa0 Brains, the largest as big around as I was tall.\\xa0 Each one was connected to the next, a chain.</p>\\n<p><em>A caterpillar, </em>in a way.\\xa0 Segmented, promising a future transformation.\\xa0 Just what that would be remained to be seen, but all I knew was that there wouldn\\u2019t be a caterpillar anymore.</p>\\n<p>Jamie made his way up a slight dias to his throne.\\xa0 The chair had machinery worked into it, metal blades that weren\\u2019t sharp, with bundles of wires running from them, into the first glass tank.</p>\\n<p>I looked away as they started plugging the individual blades into the slots and gaps in Jamie\\u2019s modified, extended spine, along his arms, and beneath his hairline.</p>\\n<p>I flinched as the switch was thrown, and the lights flickered.</p>\\n<p>He was giving them all of the information he had gathered, storing it in the tanks.\\xa0 They would, fingers crossed, give it back, helping him to organize, consolidate, and structure it.</p>\\n<p>One day, as Fray had said, they wouldn\\u2019t be able to give it back.</p>\\n<p>I turned my back on the scene, my eyes on the fires and the crowds, but I did stay with him for the remainder of the appointment.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/enemy-arc-3/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>I reached Helen.\\xa0 She hung from one hand, still holding Gladys, looking abjectly unconcerned with the immense drop below her.\\xa0 Wrist had dislocated from elbow, which had dislocated from shoulder.\\xa0 The skin stretched, and muscles stood out in odd ways in the space between the bones.\\xa0 Not that her bones were the usual sort.</p>\\n<p>Because of the way the arm and shoulder were stretched so thin, her face was contorted, the skin pulled down toward one side of her neck.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid we get her?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExactly right,\\u201d I said, quiet, bending down.\\xa0 \\u201cLine, hook, and sinker.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I took hold of her wrist with both hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not strong enough, Sy,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She craned her head around.\\xa0 \\u201cHelp is coming.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll help us up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The people who had lowered Gladys down, Gladys\\u2019 partner included, coming down the stairs from the level above.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBring them down to me and Jamie?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, Sy,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>I abandoned her.\\xa0 Down the stairs.\\xa0 My legs were tired, my brain was exhausted, my whole body ached from what had to be the lingering effects of getting shocked, and all of the pent-up emotions were dissolving into something approximating exhaustion.\\xa0 My hair stuck to my forehead, my clothing stuck to my back.\\xa0 My knees were rubbed raw from the way they\\u2019d rubbed against the sweat-damp uniform slacks.\\xa0 My skin prickled where I\\u2019d rubbed it with the chemical stuff.</p>\\n<p>There was no big plot to focus on now.\\xa0 I was Sylvester and nothing more.\\xa0 I wanted every one of my fellow Lambs to be okay, and nothing more.</p>\\n<p>By the time I reached Jamie, some of the people from downstairs were already making their way up.\\xa0 A few were clustered around him.\\xa0 Others were standing at the ready, with improvised weapons in hand.\\xa0 Shirts had been pulled off to double as headcovers, cloth was wrapped around hands, and still, they had to fight to keep the bugs off.</p>\\n<p>My thought processes and feelings were horribly confused as I wrapped my head around the scene.\\xa0 They wouldn\\u2019t be doing that if he was dead, so he was <em>okay.\\xa0 </em>Heart so<em>aring.</em>\\xa0 But he was hurt.\\xa0 Ugly feeling in my middle.\\xa0 And, perhaps the hardest thing to process, <em>I</em> wanted to be the person by his side, helping him.\\xa0 Resentment and anger.\\xa0 The feelings mingled and it felt <em>bad</em>.</p>\\n<p>It must have shown on my face, because expressions changed as people saw me drawing nearer.</p>\\n<p>Jamie\\u2019s breathing was ragged, audible from several feet away.</p>\\n<p><em>If you idiots hadn\\u2019t tipped off the monster, Jamie would be okay</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s a tough one,\\u201d a man told me.\\xa0 He had his sweater and a shirt pulled up in such a way that only his eyes were visible, but the skin around those eyes was black.\\xa0 His lab coat was buttoned up to the chin, cinched tight with a tie.\\xa0 A black man in a lab coat \\u2013 an oddity in the Academy.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s breathing on his own, and that says something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, mute.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou should cover up,\\u201d the man said, all business.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cCovered myself with kerosene.\\xa0 Bugs don\\u2019t like it, neither do the, uh, things on the walls.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis boy too?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHim too?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThought he smelled off.\\xa0 You know kerosene will burn you, smeared on like that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDiluted,\\u201d I lied.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s had been diluted, Helen hadn\\u2019t cared at all about the strength of the stuff, and it was slow to really get to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look flushed.\\xa0 If you-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t care about me,\\u201d I cut him off, before adding, \\u201cSir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave a pointed look to Jamie, to make it absolutely clear where my concerns were.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPupils are dilating.\\xa0 He follows my finger with his eyes.\\xa0 But his heartbeat isn\\u2019t strong, breathing is taking work.\\xa0 The bleeding at the side of his head makes me worry about a cranial bleed.\\xa0 Spiderweb crack of the skull, complete shoulder break, several rib, arm, and pelvis fractures.\\xa0 His stomach is firm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFirm is good?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFirm suggests internal bleeding.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He had a stern, matter-of-fact way of delivering the bad news.\\xa0 Combined with his skin color, and I could guess his history.\\xa0 Black soldier, with duties of a field medic, possibly because of things he\\u2019d picked up from his father, or another family member.\\xa0 When things had gone poorly, the medics had received advanced training.</p>\\n<p>Much as was the case with the women who\\u2019d worked at the Academy during wartime, the Academy had decided that even if someone was black, knowledge was knowledge.</p>\\n<p>That he was <em>here</em> in the Bowels now, that was notable.\\xa0 That he was the one looking after Jamie, that was something else altogether.\\xa0 People who\\u2019d had to fight for power so often set everything but their work aside, even decency and kindness.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was one such person, I suspected.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s going to need surgery,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m doing it right here.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t like the idea of moving him, with this many breaks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>In a very serious, low tone, he told me, \\u201cIt isn\\u2019t going to be pretty.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen worse,\\u201d I said, in that same tone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Sy?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s gone, Jamie.\\xa0 Helen and I got her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That turned heads.\\xa0 Fuck it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Sy.\\xa0 I talked to her\\u2026 I told her lies,</em>\\u201d he said.\\xa0 His voice was reedy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know, Jamie.\\xa0 I was there for the start of it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No.\\xa0 I\\u2026 kept talking\\u2026 wasn\\u2019t thinking\\u2026 not straight\\u2026 rambling\\u2026 lies.\\u201d</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not following.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Stupid lies\\u2026 contradicting\\u2026 myself\\u2026 she knew\\u2026 she listened\\u2026 stroked my face\\u2026</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe hurt you,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Don\\u2019t think\\u2026</em>\\u201d he said, but he didn\\u2019t find the word or the breath to finish the statement.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe hurt you on purpose, Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>I saw her fall\\u2026</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told you, Jamie, she\\u2019s gone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Started out\\u2026 telling her about\\u2026 her dream\\u2026 things she might have wanted\\u2026 but after\\u2026 was\\u2026 ugh\\u2026 hurts.\\u201d</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWords can wait, son,\\u201d the doctor who was sitting with Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie continued, oblivious.\\xa0 <em>\\u201cWas telling\\u2026 her\\u2026 about my dreams\\u2026 things I wanted\\u2026 things\\u2026 never told\\u2026 anyone.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou did good, Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>She\\u2026 was gentle</em>.\\xa0 <em>Made me comfo\\u2026 comfortable.\\xa0 Without hurting\\u2026</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was still on that?</p>\\n<p>The fingers of his good hand twitched.\\xa0 I reached out to take it.</p>\\n<p>He panted, as if speaking had meant he lost more air than he took in, even with the ragged gasping breaths, and he needed to refill the reserves.</p>\\n<p>I thought back through what Jamie had said, trying to find the main thrust of it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou reached deep,\\u201d I murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cTo her, and inside yourself, in order to survive, and to help <em>us</em> survive.\\xa0 You were hurting, your defenses were down.\\xa0 The same thing happens with people who are kept as prisoners of war, or kidnapping victims.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 She was\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSub Rosa was bad, Jamie.\\xa0 She hurt an awful lot of people, and when it came down to it, she went after Shipman, and that was how we beat her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWent\\u2026 after?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStabbed?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Then I realized what Jamie was saying.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t concern for Shipman\\u2019s welfare, or for Gordon, who liked the girl.</p>\\n<p>He was trying to gauge whether his estimation of Sub Rosa had been right or wrong.</p>\\n<p>I opened my mouth to revise my statement, to clarify, but Jamie cracked his eye open in that same moment.\\xa0 It was barely open at all, squinting against light and pain, and it was so bloodshot it made me think of Sub Rosa\\u2019s eye socket, filled with clotted blood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Don\\u2019t\\u2026 lie, Sy,</em>\\u201d he told me.</p>\\n<p>Even in this state, he had enough of a sense of me to gauge that I was venturing into the territory of dishonesty.\\xa0 For his sake, to soothe his conscience, but I\\u2019d been on the cliff.</p>\\n<p>I shut my mouth, holding back the lie, and gave his fingers a light squeeze.</p>\\n<p>We sat for a good minute.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t like how things sat.\\xa0 Jamie was squirming more, and I wasn\\u2019t sure it was physical pain.\\xa0 Much as I\\u2019d suggested, his defenses were low.\\xa0 This, lying in a broken heap on the staircase, was Jamie laid bare.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d done nothing to assuage his worries.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDown there, Sub Rosa killed people, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d the doctor said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did she have you doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe wall came apart.\\xa0 We were pulling out slabs.\\xa0 There were crates at the back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCrates?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExplosives.\\xa0 Sticks of dynamite, stacked high, inside the wall.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid she want to bring this whole place down?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho knows?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A bystander spoke up,\\xa0 \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t think it\\u2019s that easy.\\xa0 There are mechanisms in place.\\xa0 Sand, water.\\xa0 There\\u2019d be damage, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>But she knows this place too well</em>, I thought.\\xa0 She would know the dynamite wouldn\\u2019t necessarily do the trick, and the Academy wouldn\\u2019t store enough dynamite to destroy the Bowels.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe blowing an escape route out of here,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr setting a trap for when they opened the seal and came down here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No</em>,\\u201d Jamie wheezed.</p>\\n<p>I looked at him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Walled up\\u2026 tunnel\\u2026 I think.\\xa0 Layout of\\u2026 Academy, only\\u2026\\xa0 one place\\u2026 she could go\\u2026 ow, ow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne place?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis deep?\\u2026 Radham\\u2019s monster\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were murmurs.</p>\\n<p>Jamie wasn\\u2019t being discreet, but he had an excuse, and I was beyond the point of caring.</p>\\n<p>Radham\\u2019s monster.\\xa0 Sleeping away in a chamber beneath the Academy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid she intend to wake it up and destroy Radham?\\xa0 Or was she <em>risking</em> waking it up to get out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t\\u2026 know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\xa0</p>\\n<p>I watched Jamie breathing, worrying he might stop at any moment.\\xa0 He was squirming less than before.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t entirely sure what that meant, but I hoped that his conscience regarding Sub Rosa was clearer, and that he\\u2019d been reminded what she\\u2019d been.</p>\\n<p>Which wasn\\u2019t to say that who she was and what we\\u2019d faced weren\\u2019t entirely different things.</p>\\n<p>A fresh group of people began making their way up the stairs, carrying tools and kits.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you stay there, you can\\u2019t do anything, you can\\u2019t move, you <em>cannot</em> get in the way,\\u201d the black doctor told me.\\xa0 \\u201cNo matter how bad it looks, or how violent we seem to be acting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve seen worse, really.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy, was it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester.\\xa0 Sy or Sly to friends.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester, then.\\xa0 Sit tight.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll do what we can.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I watched as they got all the tools ready, kit and kaboodle all laid out.\\xa0 There were murmurs from the bystanders, all Academy trained, commenting on what should be done first, where the priorities were, approaches and methods.\\xa0 Yet it was <em>this</em> man who\\u2019d stepped forward to help Jamie.</p>\\n<p>I wondered how much there was at play in that.\\xa0 Was it the sort of thing where people thought that blame might be laid at the feet of a doctor who tried and failed to save Jamie?</p>\\n<p>There was a refuge in thinking about that sort of thing.\\xa0 The mechanisms at work inside people\\u2019s heads.</p>\\n<p>This was a man who stood alone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoctor,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you save him, you can call me Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t take his eyes off Jamie, but he murmured, \\u201cWillard D.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I made a mental note, not that my mental notes were reliable.</p>\\n<p>I saw Willard\\u2019s hands go to the buttons at Jamie\\u2019s collar.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEveryone else,\\u201d I said, \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t have something to contribute, get lost.\\xa0 It\\u2019s still dangerous, and enough stings from those bugs will stop your heart.\\xa0 Go to your labs, close the doors, and block any openings.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The warning was enough to scare most off.\\xa0 Only a few lingered, out of ego or curiosity.</p>\\n<p>I watched as Jamie\\u2019s uniform was alternately unbuttoned and cut away.\\xa0 The scars were on full display.</p>\\n<p>Willard looked up at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t cut across the scars,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan I ask what they are?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cClassified,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t think you have permission to know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cLooks like I signed on for quite a task, then,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I watched him making the initial incisions in Jamie\\u2019s belly.\\xa0 My eye didn\\u2019t leave that scalpel, until I felt a hand on my hair.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen, sitting on the stair above me.\\xa0 She\\u2019d mostly fixed her arm, but the wrist hung limp and there were light bruises.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She stroked my hair again.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I returned my eyes to the scalpel, as if I could <em>will</em> it to be steady.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The agreement had been to take turns watching Jamie.\\xa0 When this had been decided, Gordon, Gladys, Lillian, and Mary had insisted that <em>they</em> be the ones to watch, as they\\u2019d slept through the finale with Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I lay my side with a rolled up lab coat for a pillow, another lab coat draped over me, lying on the floor of the lab where the others had dozed off, now free to rest and recuperate, exhausted to the bone, but instead I\\u2019d spent hours watching the rise and fall of Jamie\\u2019s chest, and watching Mary.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary\\u2019s watch had been spent sharpening a knives, until Gordon muttered something rude at her.\\xa0 After that, she\\u2019d taken to coiling the remainder of the razor wire, unwinding it, then fixing it, over and over.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I watched through half-lidded eyes as she suddenly rose, walked over to the clock on the desk, lit a fresh candle, positioned the case around the new candle to reduce the light, then went to rouse Lillian.\\xa0 Without compunction, Mary took the space Lillian had been using to sleep, makeshift pillow and the fire blanket both.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian didn\\u2019t fidget.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t read or pace or do much of anything.\\xa0 A few times she rose from her seat, she checked on Jamie, then returned to her perch on the stool.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">About thirty minutes in, I heard her making small sounds.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Thirty-five minutes in, I roused.\\xa0 In the gloom, I approached her and put my arms around her.\\xa0 She started squirming, trying to wipe away tears, but I shifted my grip to hug her tighter, holding her arms to her side.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOne of the worst things that could have happened to you happened yesterday,\\u201d I whispered in her ear.\\xa0 \\u201cYou made it, Lil.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDon\\u2019t-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cLil.\\xa0 You made it, and you did <em>well.</em>\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI didn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019d be the first person to tell you if you didn\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cRight?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She made a small incoherent sound that might have been reluctant agreement.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou did well.\\xa0 Carry that with you.\\xa0 You faced your worst fear\\u2026 now leave it behind,\\u201d I told her, voice soft, with cadence, soothing.\\xa0 \\u201cToday, you made great strides toward being the very awesome Lil-the-adult you\\u2019re going to become.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She nodded, the back of her head rubbing against my chest.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCome on,\\u201d I whispered.\\xa0 \\u201cOver here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I led her to the spot where I\\u2019d been lying down.\\xa0 She obeyed, wiping again at her face now that I wasn\\u2019t keeping her from doing it.\\xa0 I\\u2019d meant it to be a kind of permission to keep crying, but she\\u2019d gone and stopped.\\xa0 Silly.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cLie down,\\u201d I whispered.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m on watch,\\u201d she whispered, in an even quieter voice.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m not sleeping anyway,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLie down, rest easy.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll wake up tomorrow, and this whole thing with me being nice will have been a dream.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She let out a hiccup of a giggle, then wiped at her face again, but she did lie down.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I helped her fix the lab coat blanket, then sat down, my back to her stomach, arms around my knees, watching Jamie.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">For his part, he watched me.\\xa0 He\\u2019d seen it all.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I\\u2019d chosen a position, unfortunately, that didn\\u2019t give me a good view of the clock on the desk.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t want to move for fear of disturbing Lillian, so I stayed where I was.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The hours passed in a vague, dreamlike way.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t once come close to nodding off, sitting there listening to the pattern of breathing from the six Lambs.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I sat there watching, as Gordon and Gladys roused together, taking a seat on the table opposite me, and spent a while watching together.\\xa0 I gave him a little wave, to let him know I was awake, and he waved back.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I could have gone to sleep, knowing they were on watch, but I didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 I might have done it or pretended to do it to give them privacy, but as much as I liked Gordon, I didn\\u2019t like Gladys enough to go to the trouble.\\xa0 They talked amongst themselves, confiding, Gordon keeping the periodic chuckle quiet.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was no way to track time, but by the movement of the candlelight and shadows, I might have guessed it was two or so hours later that we felt the tremor.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Every sleeping individual stirred awake as it built in intensity, making the room rumble.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gordon stood, crossed the room, and flicked the light switch.\\xa0 The lights that came on were the ordinary ones, not the emergency ones.</p>\\n<p

letting us out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There were nods and people rubbing at eyes in response.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe should wait, there are going to be a lot of people rushing to get out.\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She looked far less disheveled than someone who had just been sleeping was supposed to look.\\xa0 She had minimal bed hair, and her clothes weren\\u2019t even that much more wrinkled.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I could imagine the pushing and shoving at the top of the staircase.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cStill sitting tight,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I looked at the others, and saw Mary\\u2019s hair.\\xa0 She <em>did</em> have messy hair.\\xa0 I grinned and pointed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She smiled back, and set to trying to fix it.\\xa0 Apparently a comb and ribbons were part of her arsenal, tucked away on her person.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s too bad,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cFeels like it\\u2019s been too long.\\xa0 I\\u2019m looking forward to some fresh air.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t the only one to nod agreement.</p>\\n<p>There was a knock at the door.\\xa0 Gordon, sitting by the door, opened it without rising from his perch.\\xa0 When he saw who it was, he stood so he could open it wider.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGladys?\\u201d Gladys\\u2019 coworker asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m going.\\xa0 If you want to come?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gladys glanced at Gordon, then nodded at the woman.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll walk you to the edge of the crowd,\\u201d Gordon said, glancing back at us.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd report back to these guys about how things look.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d Helen said, brightly.\\xa0 \\u201cHave fun!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon smiled, then left with the two doctors.</p>\\n<p>I watched the door slowly swing closed.\\xa0 Mary craned her neck, shifting over from her seat on the stool to match the movement of the door, looking, and I saw her eyes momentarily light up, legs kicking in excitement.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d Lillian whispered.</p>\\n<p>Mary pursed her lips in a kiss, and I felt my heart sink.</p>\\n<p>As if to symbolize something, like <em>entombment</em>, the door shut with a woof of air, sealing by way of a tight fit and sheer weight.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot a fan,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf Gladys?\\u201d Mary asked, still smiling a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf <em>them</em>.\\xa0 As a pair.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t get it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe got his moment as the knight in shining armor,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI bet he\\u2019s the kind of boy that likes that idea.\\xa0 But I think she\\u2019s more appreciative of the fact that he <em>explained</em> things after.\\xa0 She seems like the type that\\u2019s ignored relationships in favor of work.\\xa0 He must have found a chink in the armor, awakened that interest.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you miss Cupid now?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou pay attention to this sort of thing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI prefer Aphrodite,\\u201d Helen said, still smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m working on it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGrumpy this morning,\\u201d Jamie muttered.\\xa0 He was awake, but he hadn\\u2019t roused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJealous?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>I wheeled on her.</p>\\n<p>She grinned, showing me all of her tiny perfect white teeth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh, no,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDefinitely not.\\xa0 Not on any level.\\xa0 I\\u2019d take <em>Sub Rosa </em>on a date before I took Shipman, and I\\u2019m not jealous of her for having Gordon because I\\u2019m a guy and Gordon is most definitely not a girl.\\xa0 No and <em>nope</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut she\\u2019s taking him away from the group,\\u201d Lillian said, behind me.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay to be jealous of that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not jealous!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie slowly, painfully reached out, his fingers and hand extending toward my foot.\\xa0 I put the toe of my shoe further out in his direction.</p>\\n<p>He gave it a pat.\\xa0 \\u201cThere there.\\xa0 There there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d hit you if I wasn\\u2019t worried it would kill you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head, resolving to ignore Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201cIs this a long term thing?\\xa0 Him and her?\\xa0 How does that work?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll find out and we\\u2019ll figure it out,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Ugh,</em>\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>You</em> can.\\xa0 I\\u2019m going to live in happy little Sylvestertown, where this isn\\u2019t a thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s growing up, our golden hero,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.\\xa0 \\u201cFirst one of us to reach that point, I guess.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The moment of silence that followed the statement caught me off guard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich point?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLiking someone?\\u201d I asked, back, a little confused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said, softly, head down against his pillow, eyes closed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\u201d Lillian said, uncertainly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon\\u2019s a late bloomer, all things considered,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>All eyes fell on me.\\xa0 The latest of bloomers, it seemed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No,</em>\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo way.\\xa0 That\\u2019s not fair!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re one of the youngest of us, and you\\u2019re a <em>boy</em>,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry.\\xa0 Your time will come.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re all a bunch of dirty liars, you\\u2019re doing this to mess with me!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe <em>is</em> grumpy,\\u201d Mary commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere there,\\u201d Jamie said, patting my foot again.</p>\\n<p>I pulled it away, and mimed like I was going to kick him in the head.\\xa0 It prompted the softest of laughs, which became a hacking coughing fit.</p>\\n<p>The door opened.\\xa0 Gordon.\\xa0 He gave Jamie a concerned look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWay is clear,\\u201d he reported.</p>\\n<p>We started getting ourselves pulled together, the people who\\u2019d slept without shoes pulling them on.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t taken mine off, and helped Gordon with Jamie.\\xa0 I was actually a better choice than some of the girls, because I was short enough that he could put an arm around my shoulders without reaching up and over.</p>\\n<p>Once we were all sorted, Gordon told the girls to go ahead and make sure nobody would jostle or bump us.</p>\\n<p>Our movement as a trio was excruciatingly slow, and I knew it would be worse once we reached the stairs.</p>\\n<p>As we hobbled and limped forward, trying not to jar Jamie too much, Jamie spoke up.\\xa0 \\u201cSy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d I grunted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBased on recent events, I think you\\u2019re- ah!\\xa0 You\\u2019re in good shape.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmf,\\u201d I grunted, again.\\xa0 \\u201cHow so?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen the better side of you.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t have anything to worry about.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d I grunted, bearing as much weight as I could while trying to keep Jamie from bobbing up and down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHer crying was annoying me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d Jamie made an inquisitive sound.\\xa0 \\u201cAh.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As a group, Jamie now in a wheelchair, we met Hayle and Briggs.\\xa0 Rather than going to them, we\\u2019d apparently earned the right to have them come to us, a short distance from the exit to the Bowels.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The leaves were bright, the rain light, and the sun even penetrated the clouds to a degree.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGorger communicated that you played a big role in this,\\u201d Briggs said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSy, Helen, and Jamie, toward the end,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cJamie,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 He gave Jamie a once-over.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s an operating room waiting.\\xa0 You can go.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sure the others will catch you up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019d rather stay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2026\\u201d Jamie made a face.\\xa0 \\u201cI <em>forgot</em> something.\\xa0 Missed something.\\xa0 I need an appointment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I saw his hand shake as he moved it toward his book.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI see.\\xa0 Appointment first, then operation?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie nodded, a movement made jerky by nervousness and anxiety.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Rather than make him keep reaching, I stepped close.\\xa0 I took the battered book I\\u2019d recovered while he\\u2019d been getting set up in his wheelchair and checked over.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie smiled.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Briggs signaled someone, and they approached to wheel Jamie away.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I watched him go, a sick feeling in my middle.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">His appointments were worse than mine, in a way.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIn his absence,\\u201d Briggs said, \\u201cI\\u2019d like written reports from each of you on the incident.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There were a few suppressed groans, mine was one.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s a third strike in the last year,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve already been told there will be changes.\\xa0 Radham Academy\\u2019s underground laboratories will be refurbished and redone entirely.\\xa0 Radham Academy\\u2019s staff will be overhauled.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I felt a note of alarm.\\xa0 I looked in Hayle\\u2019s direction.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cRest assured, Professor Hayle will retain his post,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 \\u201cHowever, I will not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My eyebrows went up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe sentiment across the Crown States is that there is something brewing, and apparently I am unfit to lead the Academy through it.\\xa0 It may be right,\\u201d Briggs said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I didn\\u2019t miss the hint of bitterness in his voice.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This was a demotion he would never recover from.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cRadham will be looked after by a Duke, I believe the man is sixteenth in line for the Crown, and he has led <em>armies</em> in war,\\u201d Hayle said, looking at me.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I actually have to convey to you why you are not to get on his bad side, I\\u2019ve failed on <em>multiple</em> levels.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI understand,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI really hope you do,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe transition period will be difficult,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 \\u201cAt Professor Hayle\\u2019s recommendation, I\\u2019m assigning you a <em>task</em> in the meantime.\\xa0 A task for which you\\u2019ll need <em>these</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He reached into a deep lab coat pocket and retrieved a small bottle.\\xa0 He shook it, making the pills rattle.\\xa0 Though the glass was thick, I could tell that the pills were a deep purple.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThis is the same material we feed into the rain and the drinking water,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWithout it, you\\u2019ll find yourself quickly sickening and dying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019re leaving Radham?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>With a time limit, </em>I thought.\\xa0 Only so many pills.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAs soon as Jamie is out of the hospital and you\\u2019ve each had your appointments,\\u201d Hayle told us.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat for?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThis time, we\\u2019re dealing with a young woman on the run,\\u201d Briggs told us.\\xa0 \\u201cShe was one of several in line to become a professor, a young one, and a woman, no less.\\xa0 When she didn\\u2019t get her position, we had to take <em>measures</em>, given the knowledge she\\u2019d picked up.\\xa0 A brief incarceration, then work in the underground labs until an opportunity came up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe was a prisoner,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWith emphasis on \\u2018was\\u2019, Gordon,\\u201d Briggs said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe escaped, with the head of another prisoner.\\xa0 Her name is Genevieve Fray, and she has a deep grudge against the Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe find her, we stop her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI would very much like you to do that,\\u201d Briggs said, \\u201cBut there\\u2019s another concern at play.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He turned his eyes to me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I asked, confused.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cTo make sure everyone is on the same page,\\u201d Hayle said, \\u201cMary, I know you don\\u2019t know the full details about the other projects, unless they\\u2019ve told you things they shouldn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We had.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSylvester was an extension of an existing project, one that used minute amounts of chemicals and poisons to maintain and stimulate brain liquidity.\\xa0 Faster learning, faster adaptation, more connections.\\xa0 Many students opt into this program, taking small amounts.\\xa0 Sylvester was a stress test for the program, to discover the effective maximums and breaking point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I swallowed hard.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">This wasn\\u2019t news to me, but\\u2026</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWith his inclusion to the Lambs, we stopped pushing as hard as we were.\\xa0 We left things be as they were, and another Academy took on the task of testing the limits of the Wyvern project,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMiss Fray was someone who benefited from what we thought were small doses.\\xa0 Part of the reason for her loss of professorship was that she was manufacturing her <em>own</em> doses, for herself.\\xa0 We discovered this, among other things, and thought her too dangerous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhen you say she\\u2019s manufacturing her own doses,\\u201d I said, \\u201cIs she taking as much as me, or\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe\\u2019s angry at the Academy, her brain is working very much like yours does, Sylvester, and she\\u2019s running.\\xa0 We have a dim idea of where she is, but she\\u2019s proven too evasive for Dog and Catcher.\\xa0 You need to find her, and you need to do it <em>fast</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But my brain was only fixated on one thing.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>I have a

to one side, peering out the window, past the rain-streaked glass and into the barely-lit street.\\xa0 He focused and unfocused his gaze on three different levels, telescoping his vision.</p>\\n<p><em>Too dark.</em></p>\\n<p>He switched focuses and stresses.\\xa0 The world took on different tones, textures, and hues, as he focused on a different spectrum of light.\\xa0 He adjusted again, and the darkness was illuminated, cast in white and black.</p>\\n<p>Across the street, in the shadows between a shack and a house, a rat cleaned itself with its tongue and the water from the rain.</p>\\n<p>He snapped his eye back to Cynthia, watching the world return to focus.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing next?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 She was gathering paperwork

what he could see in the center of his field of vision.\\xa0 He could see her cleavage as clearly as if he was nestled in it.\\xa0 The pores, the tiniest, fairest of hairs, the drop of sweat that traced its way from her neck down to her collarbone, then down into the alluring shadows that her blouse cast.\\xa0 His smile widened.\\xa0 \\u201cThe smoke is too thick.\\xa0 I might wander the

luck.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re scared,\\u201d he observed.\\xa0 He could see the softest, most vulnerable parts of her, the base of the throat over the pulse, moving faintly in response to the increased heartbeat.\\xa0 She was pretty in such a natural way, but she\\u2019d gone to lengths to make herself prettier still.\\xa0 That she did it because it was just another tool or a weapon for her to employ was something special.\\xa0 Yet\\u2026 \\u201cYou\\u2019re packing up to run.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cConcerned.\\xa0 Whatever the cause of it, the fire means you can\\u2019t enter Westmore, I can\\u2019t send reinforcements, meager as they would be, and I can\\u2019t carry out my remaining gambits.\\xa0 I have no control over what happens next.\\xa0 I have no reason to stay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat is an excellent rationale,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>She gave him a sharp look.\\xa0 He cocked his head again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI preferred dealing with Melancholy,\\u201d she said, sighing.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s saying something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe is much better at dealing with people,\\u201d Sanguine said, offering his version of an ear-to-ear grin, though even at that point, his mouth was no wider than another person\\u2019s might be when at rest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, Sanguine.\\xa0 If Pock is up, you can tell him he should get some sleep,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She made it a dismissal.</p>\\n<p>He gave her a lazy salute, then headed for the door, his eyes pointing out to either side as he passed between the two immortal soldiers who guarded the door, then snapping back to point forward after they were behind him.\\xa0 Scarred and infested with parasites from head to toe, they were as stern and silent as he wasn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>He walked away with a jaunt, humming, his long rifle banging against his calf and shoulder.</p>\\n<p>He searched the streets.\\xa0 It was nice and quiet.\\xa0 The world was brightening, the sun rising, casting long shadows.</p>\\n<p>There.\\xa0 A movement beneath a building.</p>\\n<p>A stray cat slept on top of a barrel under the awnings of a shop.\\xa0 It had been targeted by one of the spiders.\\xa0 The spider had only started to work on the sleeping cat\\u2019s tail.</p>\\n<p>He knelt, raising his rifle, one eye closed, the other looking down the sights.</p>\\n<p>He adjusted for the speed with which the bullet would fall, raising the tip.</p>\\n<p><em>Squeeze the trigger.</em></p>\\n<p>The gun was loud, always was.\\xa0 Not that the spider heard in time.\\xa0 Sanguine rose to his feet in a quick, steady motion.\\xa0 Keeping with habit, always start moving right after shooting.\\xa0 One eye watched where he was going.\\xa0 The other watched the target.\\xa0 He made it one step-</p>\\n<p>-The spider was obliterated.\\xa0 The cat startled, waking up and dashing off aimlessly.</p>\\n<p>The tail would heal.</p>\\n<p>He could remember being newly made, and wanting a cat of his own.\\xa0 Having it with him on a good day, sitting in his lap while he sat cross legged, watching for a victim, purring now and then?</p>\\n<p>He swaggered his way to the labs on the Lanyard Avenue corner, pausing to admire the crown of trees growing out of the tops of the four walls, before he let himself in.</p>\\n<p>The building had been a factory once, making use of imports from Westmore, shaping iron into nails, if he had to guess from what remained.\\xa0 Most of the machines and tools had been carried out, and the place retooled.\\xa0 There was a clear space down the middle, a path drawn out without paint or tape or railings, only convention and accepted practice.\\xa0 To the left of the cleared space were tables where stitched could be made, with Stitched \\u2018sleeping\\u2019 against the wall, hooked up to a flickering battery with things swimming inside.\\xa0 To the right was Edwin Grahl\\u2019s lab.\\xa0 The man was absent, and his work was left half-complete.\\xa0 The pieces of another giant stitched arm.\\xa0 Grahl hadn\\u2019t been seen since sundown.\\xa0 He would have seen off his first cannon-wielding giant, then gone to sleep, secure enough his work would suffice for Cynthia\\u2019s purposes.</p>\\n<p>There were two sorts of people that Sanguine would see tonight.\\xa0 People who had slept through the night, like Grahl, and people who hadn\\u2019t.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t sure which one Pock was.</p>\\n<p>Though originally a factory, the building had been modified.\\xa0 Crews of stitched and grown material had been used to throw together a second floor and a roof, producing a second tier to the building within the span of a day.\\xa0 This tier was home to three more laboratories.\\xa0 One to the left, one to the right, and a third at the end, no walls separating them.\\xa0 Left and right were left unoccupied, but Pock was in the one at the end.</p>\\n<p>Pock was flanked by two identical women that stood seven feet tall, each one about ten stone at best, with long faces, folds at the eyes making them look Asian, their hair straight and black.\\xa0 Their spidery fingers were the most animated part of them, the rest of their movements so slow they looked like they were moving underwater.\\xa0 The pair took turns handing him tools as he requested them.\\xa0 He made an incision, and slid a slice of fatty tissue into the cut.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, you,\\u201d Pock said, almost derisive.\\xa0 Almost.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe.\\xa0 Cynthia Imlay would like you to know that she won\\u2019t be needing your services tonight.\\xa0 There are fires prohibiting access to the city.\\xa0 I saw with my own eyes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sanguine smirked as if he\\u2019d made a joke.</p>\\n<p>Pock stopped.\\xa0 He heaved out a sigh.\\xa0 \\u201cAre the prisoners of war still due to arrive?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery likely.\\xa0 My colleague is on it.\\xa0 But there\\u2019s no need for haste,\\u201d Sanguine said.</p>\\n<p>Pock nodded.\\xa0 He raised his hands, and the experiments on either side pulled off his gloves.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d complain, but it\\u2019ll be good to let the swelling subside, and see how close I\\u2019ve managed to get.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man on the table slept, his face subtly different from one side to the next.\\xa0 Old enough to have grayed hair, his facial hair was cut to have only a beard, no mustache.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe looks real,\\u201d Sanguine admired, studying pores and finer structures.\\xa0 There were differences from an ordinary man, but not ones a typical eye would catch.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe <em>is</em> real,\\u201d Pock said, offended.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor something made in a vat, he looks human.\\xa0 And he\\u2019s not even a clone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s close to being one.\\xa0 I had the notes from a colleague.\\xa0 We even had two conversations over the phone.\\xa0 I gave him my own notes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sanguine leaned closer, cocking his head until it was lined up with the man\\u2019s.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have a reference image?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA painting,\\u201d Pock said, pointing.</p>\\n<p>Sanguine nodded.\\xa0 He straightened.\\xa0 \\u201cBeautiful thing, this.\\xa0 To come out of war, no less.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d Pock said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWar is amazing like that, isn\\u2019t it?\\xa0 Nothing drives us to be better as much as a gun to our head does.\\xa0 With the western Crown States in the midst of a civil war, we have thirty-thousand guns to thirty-thousand heads.\\xa0 The world is going to change in the wake of this war.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course it is,\\u201d Pock said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to uproot the Academy from these states, take the clutching fingers the Crown is using to grip it and break every one, until we can retake this part of the country for ourselves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sanguine broke out into a laugh, genuine and hearty.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat sounds wonderful.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Pock wasn\\u2019t looking half as impassioned now.\\xa0 The man had gone cold.</p>\\n<p>Was the laugh too much?\\xa0 Sanguine cocked his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas there anything else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sanguine shrugged one shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can rest if you need to.\\xa0 The prisoners of war will be here by midday, if not sooner.\\xa0 We won\\u2019t lose anything if we start late.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh.\\xa0 Will you be shooting that damnable gun of yours in earshot?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s likely.\\xa0 I\\u2019m supposed to look out for trouble.\\xa0 There are some spiders lingering, at the very least.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo sleep for me, then,\\u201d Pock said, grim.</p>\\n<p>Sanguine bowed a little, then saluted in the most insulting way he could.</p>\\n<p>He passed downstairs, out the door, and locked it behind him.</p>\\n<p>His head turned.\\xa0 He studied the surroundings, adjusting the focus of his eyes as he did it.\\xa0 The changes in sharpness and softness and detail rotated through a series of possibilities, until it looked and felt as if his eyes were hearts, beating in his eye sockets.\\xa0 The surroundings throbbed in a way, and he could get a sense of dimension, of texture.\\xa0 His visual memory was acute, and as he took a few steps forward, searching, he could get a sense of where the ground rose and fell, all the way down the length of the street.</p>\\n<p>The eyes were such an important sense to humans, but the eyes had stopped developing long ago, because the developments were so very unnecessary.\\xa0 When they\\u2019d made his eyes, they\\u2019d turned to sea creatures for inspiration.\\xa0 Even his face was a bit fishy, he liked to think.</p>\\n<p>He smiled.</p>\\n<p>He could see footprints in the mud.\\xa0 He could gauge their size, follow their path, see how the light rainfall distorted the water that had collected in them, and even guess at the amount of muddy water within, water that would have been squeezed out by the weight of the foot setting down.\\xa0 His eyes pointed in two different directions and adjusted until he could compare both places at once, his own footprints from a minute ago against this very small footprint.\\xa0 The amount of water suggested that the person had passed by a moment after he had.</p>\\n<p>He was amused by the fact that they had probably been watching him, yet he hadn\\u2019t seen them.</p>\\n<p>One child.\\xa0 A Lamb?</p>\\n<p>It took him a minute to walk to the set of tracks.\\xa0 He pulled his gun around, holding it in both hands, though he didn\\u2019t point it at anything.</p>\\n<p>Whitney wasn\\u2019t a city meant for warfare and the military.\\xa0 The layout wasn\\u2019t organized in a way that made it easy to defend and hard to take.\\xa0 The military leadership, Cynthia included, had wanted to situate themselves at the center, at the heart of things, except the buildings there were mostly shops.\\xa0 They\\u2019d changed the buildings here and there, and made compromises elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>The footprints led to one such compromise.\\xa0 A shop with living quarters above it.</p>\\n<p>He slowly turned, taking in the surroundings.\\xa0 Looking, searching for more errant children.</p>\\n<p>He slipped a bullet into his gun, then fired blindly at the sky.\\xa0 He did it again, then again, then again.</p>\\n<p>It was Pock who stepped out of the Lanyard Labs, swearing up a storm.\\xa0 His assistants followed him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe hell do you think you\\u2019re doing, you imbecile!?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sanguine held up a hand, index finger raised.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 You\\u2019re telling me to wait now?\\xa0 You wake half the city, and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan you shoot?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShoot.\\xa0 Are you able?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Of course.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sanguine nodded, his eyes still roaming.\\xa0 He drew a gun from inside his jacket and tossed it to Pock\\u2019s assistant, who caught it.</p>\\n<p>Pock\\u2019s attitude changed.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou are coming with me.\\xa0 We\\u2019re entering this building.\\xa0 A spy is lurking within.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd why would I put myself in close proximity to a spy?\\u201d Pock asked, derisive.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause the tracks suggest a limp, making this one the most obvious target,\\u201d Sanguine said, \\u201cAnd because there are five more close by.\\xa0 If I leave you alone, you\\u2019ll be dead before I step outside again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Pock didn\\u2019t have a ready answer for that.</p>\\n<p>Sanguine reached into his coat, then affixed a blade to his rifle.\\xa0 He took his time securing the bayonet, using a key to tighten the banding, before slipping the key into a notch to secure it\\u2019s place on the barrel.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe others.\\xa0 If there\\u2019s that much danger, then-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia will have heard the shots and thought there was something unusual about it.\\xa0 She knows there\\u2019s danger.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re sure?\\xa0 Because she-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen her fight.\\xa0 She\\u2019s the rare sort of capable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you done interrupting me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Because you must be exceedingly quiet,\\u201d Sanguine said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr you may die, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Pock fell silent.</p>\\n<p>Sanguine smiled as he approached the door.\\xa0 He nudged it open with one toe.\\xa0 \\u201cLeave your assistants outside.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll make too much noise.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He adjusted to the darkness with a speed and facility that matched poor Pock\\u2019s ability and quickness in blinking.</p>\\n<p>Dusty.\\xa0 The store hadn\\u2019t been cleaned since the commanding officer had taken up residence upstairs.\\xa0 Light streamed from the window above the stairs.</p>\\n<p>Another adjustment this time.\\xa0 Focusing on light, contrast.</p>\\n<p>The specks of dust almost glowed, as he focused on the way they caught the light.\\xa0 Fireflies in darkness, swirling, dancing.</p>\\n<p>The swirling was more intense further up the stairs.\\xa0 His quarry had passed by more than a minute ago, but the air still stirred, just a little.</p>\\n<p>And, halfway up the stairs, he noted a wire.</p>\\n<p>Not meant for people giving chase or coming upstairs.\\xa0 For someone going down.</p>\\n<p>A just-in-case measure, was it?\\xa0 If the target got away and ran for the front door?</p>\\n<p>He approached the stairs, touching the blade of the bayonet to the wire.</p>\\n<p>Movement.\\xa0 Slight.</p>\\n<p>He leaned over the railing, repeating the touch.</p>\\n<p>An empty flower vase on a little stand beneath the stairs moved in response.\\xa0 The razor thread wound lightly around the railing, extended down to the vase.\\xa0 If disturbed, the vase would fall.</p>\\n<p>Because of the limp.\\xa0 A lack of security in his or her own ability?</p>\\n<p>Was it the boy he\\u2019d shot the previous day?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAssassin,\\u201d he murmured.\\xa0 He couldn\\u2019t hold back his excitement.</p>\\n<p>Pock made a face, quizzical.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot a spy.\\xa0 An assassin,\\u201d he clarified.\\xa0 \\u201cTake the vase, Pock.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Pock did as he was told.\\xa0 Good man.\\xa0 Sanguine turned the rifle upside-down and used the sharp end of the bayonet blade to cut the wire.</p>\\n<p>He gestured for Pock to follow, watching the movement of the dust in the air as he ascended the stairs.</p>\\n<p>He saw the way the swirl of dust danced down the hallway, leading to a room at the end.</p>\\n<p>He gestured for Pock to stop, this time.\\xa0 His feet fell on the sides of the hallway, not the center, and he transferred his weight slowly.\\xa0 His body had suffered in the same set of treatments made to capitalize on his eyes.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t strong.\\xa0 He was sensitive to the heat and the cold, which were bad traits for a sniper who would otherwise want to remain still in poor weather for long periods of time.\\xa0 But that same degree of sensitivity let him sense the creaks as they started, shift his weight away, move the foot to the next few floorboards, and try again.</p>\\n<p>He was silent enough that he could hear Pock more than he heard himself.</p>\\n<p>He stopped at the doorway.\\xa0 He could hear whisperings, two voices.</p>\\n<p>A girl and a man.</p>\\n<p>His movement noiseless and smooth, he leaned his head forward, peering past the doorway.\\xa0 Nothing so sudden to draw focus.</p>\\n<p>The girl was straddling the officer, who was in bed, wearing his pyjamas.\\xa0 Her knees were pressing his arms down, but he was undoubtedly strong enough to throw her off.\\xa0 The wire she had around his throat was keeping the man still.\\xa0 She held it with one hand, the wire wound around the handle of a knife.\\xa0 The other hand was on the headboard, so she could lean forward, her face inches from his.\\xa0 She was wearing a raincoat over a dress with lace at the ends.\\xa0 Twelve or thirteen years old, ribbons in her brown hair.</p>\\n<p>But she had the eyes of a killer.\\xa0 Her pupils were contracted to sharp points.</p>\\n<p>Sanguine stepped forward, thrusting.\\xa0 The floor creaked.</p>\\n<p>The girl moved, rolling to one side.\\xa0 The wire unspooled from the handle, and Sanguine lunged for it, using the sheer length of the rifle to try and get the point of the bayonet\\u2019s blade under it.</p>\\n<p>She saw, and she moved, turning so her own body pressed against the wire, while her hand pulled it down, flush against the bedspread, while it cinched tighter around the officer\\u2019s neck.\\xa0 It took Sanguine a second to turn the bayonet around, slash at the wire.</p>\\n<p>But she was already moving, taking advantage of the moment\\u2019s pause.\\xa0 There was a nightstand on the far side of the bed.\\xa0 She heaved it over, and the cord went tighter still, digging into the corner of the bed.\\xa0 She\\u2019d wound the wire around the drawer or ornamental bit of the piece of furniture, and now she used the weight of it.\\xa0 The blade\\u2019s point dragged against woolen covers and sheets, but not deep enough to cut wire.</p>\\n<p>Sanguine threw himself forward to get a better angle.\\xa0 The only place the wire wasn\\u2019t digging into the bed was next to the man\\u2019s neck.\\xa0 He found the right position, pulling the blade along the wire rather than sawing or pushing, aware that his quarry was heaving the window open, casting one look over her shoulder, eye glinting-</p>\\n<p>The thin wire snapped where the blade had cut at it, going slack.\\xa0 Sanguine was only dimly aware of the way the blood welled out from where the wire had dug into flesh.\\xa0 Too much, too fast.\\xa0 No arterial spurts, but enough blood that the man was almost guaranteed to die.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPock!\\u201d Sanguine called out.</p>\\n<p>Without waiting for a response, he hurdled over the bed, going to the open window, thrusting the gun\\u2019s point and the blade through, followed by his head and one arm, eyes pointing in either direction.</p>\\n<p>She was at the side, climbing over to the front of the building.\\xa0 The eaves.\\xa0 Her eyes were already on him.\\xa0 She\\u2019d seen the gun\\u2019s point emerge.\\xa0 Saw what he was going to do next.</p>\\n<p>He wanted to see what she had planned, and it wasn\\u2019t like he was going to do something different.</p>\\n<p>He slapped the gun against the side of the building, aiming, squeezing-</p>\\n<p>Sanguine saw the movement, the tensing muscle, and relaxed his grip.\\xa0 She threw herself back and away, pulling her raincoat up and over her head.</p>\\n<p>He followed her, watching her lift her raincoat up, so it would catch on the edge of the gutter for the next house over.\\xa0 She now gripped the inside of the sleeves, while the middle of the raincoat looped over.\\xa0 She let the raincoat sleeves turn inside-out, controlling her descent.</p>\\n<p>He moved the gun over, aiming, so he could shoot her the moment she was in the air, when no amount of agility or cleverness would let her move to either side.</p>\\n<p>Except she hauled down on one sleeve of the raincoat, changing the angle of her descent a fraction.\\xa0 In the final moment before she let go of the raincoat, she swung a bit to one side, letting go.</p>\\n<p>He adjusted his aim, ready to hit her as she hit the ground, two or three feet to the left of where she had originally been planning.\\xa0 He pulled the trigger this time.</p>\\n<p>She hit the ground with a stagger.\\xa0 The wood of the porch railing beside her exploded into splinters.</p>\\n<p>She flashed him a white-toothed grin before half-spinning, half-stumbling around the corner of the porch, ducking too low for him to have a clear shot.</p>\\n<p>He smiled.</p>\\n<p>He loved it when they were clever.</p>\\n<p>He pulled away from the window.\\xa0 There was no point, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t save him,\\u201d Pock said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I had my kit-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d Sanguine said.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t surprised.\\xa0 He crossed the room to look the terrified man in the eyes.\\xa0 He gave the man a light slap on the cheek.\\xa0 \\u201cYou.\\xa0 The girl was asking questions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man sputtered, spit, not blood.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease help.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou heard the doctor,\\u201d Sanguine said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can\\u2019t.\\xa0 What was she asking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man was breathing hard.\\xa0 He had that animal look in his eyes.\\xa0 A horse in panic.</p>\\n<p>Sad, coming from a soldier.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas she asking about Cynthia?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man\\u2019s attention clarified a moment.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe was?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man nodded slightly, before something reminded him of his present circumstances.\\xa0 The panic returned.\\xa0 His eyes were unfocused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey split up,\\u201d Sanguine said.\\xa0 \\u201cNow they\\u2019re going to converge.\\xa0 I need to find them as they do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 They were going to do this to me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably,\\u201d Sanguine said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cI like them.\\xa0 Nightmarish little pricks, aren\\u2019t they?\\xa0 The girl was wounded and threw herself off the side of the building.\\xa0 Must have hurt like the dickens.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI- what?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome now, sir,\\u201d Sanguine said.\\xa0 His blood was pumping, he felt almost drugged.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t be so surprised.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve dealt with monsters before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He stood, backing away from the bed, cocking his head to one side as he studied the dying commander.</p>\\n<p>He pointed the rifle at the man, who was too out of his senses to even recognize the threat.</p>\\n<p>Thrusting, he drove the blade\\u2019s point into the roof of the man\\u2019s mouth, and into the brain.\\xa0 The man jerked, struggled for a moment, and then abruptly died.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood god!\\u201d Pock said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe key parts of the brain should be intact,\\u201d Sanguine said, raising his voice to be heard as he walked away.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m going, you stay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat if they come back!?\\u201d\\xa0 Pock reached the railing by the stairwell and leaned over.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey won\\u2019t.\\xa0 They can\\u2019t.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll be striking at key targets before fleeing!\\u201d Sanguine called out.</p>\\n<p>He pushed the door open, eyes adjusting for distant targets before he was even outside.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia.</p>\\n<p>She could handle her own.\\xa0 He knew that.</p>\\n<p>The sole building that was toward the center of the town that was also fit for the rebellion forces to use was a mason\\u2019s workshop.\\xa0 Stone walls, tall, spacious, it could take a hit from a bomb without crumbling into tinder and dust.\\xa0 Cynthia had changed the location of her headquarters from the theater after the children had been chased from town.</p>\\n<p>A door halfway to Sanguine\\u2019s destination was left unlocked, slightly ajar.\\xa0 Grahl\\u2019s place.\\xa0 One of his eyes peered through windows.</p>\\n<p>There.\\xa0 Through the front window.\\xa0 Grahl had spent the night in an armchair, a bottle and a glass beside him.\\xa0 Not one to sleep through a battle after all.\\xa0 The handle of a hatchet or hammer stuck up and away from his head like a lone insect\\u2019s antennae.</p>\\n<p>There were others.\\xa0 The children had moved unerringly, as far as he could tell.\\xa0 Had they planned this from the beginning, figuring out who was where, who would be remaining here, vulnerable, when the fighting was elsewhere, or was it simply an amazing degree of coordination?</p>\\n<p>He focused on the tracks.\\xa0 Knew they were different ones.\\xa0 Three children.\\xa0 One with a limp, another slow, not running but not limping either.</p>\\n<p>Just before reaching Cynthia\\u2019s place, the sets of tracks diverged.</p>\\n<p>He felt excited, seeing it.</p>\\n<p>They knew he was following.\\xa0 They would lay a trap for him.\\xa0 Try to distract.</p>\\n<p>The mason\\u2019s house.</p>\\n<p>He slowed, searching.</p>\\n<p>A giggle.</p>\\n<p>A girl\\u2019s.\\xa0 Hard to match to the girl with the limp.\\xa0 The sound carried.</p>\\n<p>Melancholy had mentioned their names, reading what Cynthia had given them, he wished he remembered.</p>\\n<p>A distraction?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry about Melancholic!\\u201d the voice called out, so innocent it was almost taunting.\\xa0 The sound bounced off walls of a nearby alley.\\xa0 \\u201cI broke her!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ah.\\xa0 Wasn\\u2019t that too bad?</p>\\n<p>Still, he smiled.\\xa0 The theatrics were a nice touch.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCholeric too!\\xa0 Riddled him full of holes!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sanguine nodded.\\xa0 He believed it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd poor Phlegm!\\xa0 Killed him again!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Marvelous control of sound.\\xa0 Changing position, letting the voice carry, bouncing at him from different directions.</p>\\n<p>Phlegm would have liked that, ironically enough.</p>\\n<p>He felt sad, but it was a small sadness.\\xa0 Not that his colleagues were dead, but because he\\u2019d always assumed that when one of them fell, the rest would fall in short order.</p>\\n<p>And, Sanguine told himself, he didn\\u2019t plan on dying tonight.</p>\\n<p>He asserted his grip on his gun, reaching the front door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWrong direction!\\xa0 She ran!\\u201d the girl called out.</p>\\n<p>He hesitated, hand on the doorknob.\\xa0 One eye flicked out to the side.</p>\\n<p>No tracks fresh enough to be hers.</p>\\n<p>A gunshot startled him.\\xa0 Distant.\\xa0 A window two feet left broke.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShoot, gosh, and damn!\\u201d the girl called out.\\xa0 \\u201cMissed!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He pushed his way in through the door.</p>\\n<p>Theatrics, with a slim chance of a lucky shot.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been too far away to be shooting at him with a pistol.</p>\\n<p>The mason\\u2019s workshop was dark.\\xa0 Lights had gone out.</p>\\n<p>Halfway between the front door and the stairwell, one of the so-called immortals lay bleeding.</p>\\n<p>At the door to Cynthia\\u2019s office, another lay dead.</p>\\n<p>He walked past them, ignoring the dying man, and moved through the workshop.\\xa0 No sign of life.</p>\\n<p>He had to be right on their heels.\\xa0 The children weren\\u2019t fast.</p>\\n<p>Through the back door.\\xa0 Tracks only a handful of seconds old.</p>\\n<p>A glimpse of movement, further down, between the base of the hill and the back of the workshop.\\xa0 He adjusted his eyes a second too late.</p>\\n<p>There was only a narrow avenue behind the buildings, with sparse grass growing, and the periodic flower.\\xa0 With the water rolling off the mountainside and down into this space, it had to be fertile ground, though it wouldn\\u2019t get much sun.\\xa0 He stepped carefully past fallen firewood, eyes searching.</p>\\n<p>Had to think like the children.\\xa0 They were steering, moving as a pack of wolves might.\\xa0 Around the periphery, chasing, guiding.</p>\\n<p>Except he had to think like Cynthia might as well.\\xa0 Because she would recognize what the children did and try to find an avenue they weren\\u2019t covering.\\xa0 A gap in the net.</p>\\n<p>The slower ones would be closer to him.\\xa0 The quicker ones further down, cutting her off.</p>\\n<p>He ran, feet tramping down on the footpath.\\xa0 The girl wouldn\\u2019t have had time to lay a wire, but-</p>\\n<p>There.\\xa0 Caltrops.\\xa0 Nails bent so that four prongs stuck out in different directions, left in the dirt.</p>\\n<p>He skipped past them.</p>\\n<p>Heard a whistle, close.\\xa0 Above?</p>\\n<p>Looking up, he almost missed what was happening to his left.\\xa0 He passed a space between buildings, and the girl who had had the wire was there, already in motion, out on the street in front of the buildings.\\xa0 Keen eyes saw the movement.\\xa0 Throwing.</p>\\n<p>He ducked, bending over.\\xa0 The blade struck his back, across his shoulderblades.</p>\\n<p>Fingers gripped the corner of the building, helping him come to a stop on the slick ground.\\xa0 He heaved himself in the opposite direction, toward that same alley.</p>\\n<p>Gone.\\xa0 Of course.</p>\\n<p>One on the roof, to let her know he was coming, so she could be ready.\\xa0 Slowed as she was, she would have had to have carried straight on down the road, while he was busy navigating the building interior.</p>\\n<p>Wolves circling.</p>\\n<p>He watched for her as he continued running behind the buildings, following Cynthia\\u2019s tracks.\\xa0 He saw soldiers on the street.\\xa0 They were shouting, calling out.</p>\\n<p>A smell in the air.\\xa0 He wrinkled his nose.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d used her gas.\\xa0 The foul, sense-obscuring stuff.\\xa0 Somewhere further down.</p>\\n<p>He broke away.\\xa0 No use following, if he\\u2019d lose any use of his eyes from the lingering traces of the stuff.\\xa0 He headed to the soldiers, hailing them.\\xa0 Ordinary men.\\xa0 Boys, almost.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou,\\u201d one soldier said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne of the assassins?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sanguine nodded, focusing more on catching his breath and studying the surroundings.</p>\\n<p>No sign of the limping girl.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou should know, the children she warned us of are about,\\u201d the soldier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCommander ordered the group to follow her, warn her.\\xa0 We were told to stay, pass on word.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sanguine frowned, eyes peeled for any movements.</p>\\n<p>One on the roof, but he didn\\u2019t see a thing.</p>\\n<p>One on the ground, the limping girl with the wire and the knife.\\xa0 But she wasn\\u2019t moving forward.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe carried on this way?\\u201d Sanguine asked, indicating the other direction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe did.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo her apartment?\\u201d Sanguine asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>And they chased her</em>.\\xa0 <em>The soldiers chased her.</em></p>\\n<p>Not just a handful of children chasing her.\\xa0 Her own men would be looking for her.\\xa0 Very possibly tipping off the children to her location.</p>\\n<p>Sanguine broke into a run.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d showed themselves for a reason.\\xa0 Raising the alarm.\\xa0 People would find the dead officers and doctors and instinctively want to protect Cynthia, among others.</p>\\n<p>That she\\u2019d changed where she operated from, both to the Mason\\u2019s and where she laid her head at night, it didn\\u2019t matter.\\xa0 All the children had to do was follow the soldiers.</p>\\n<p>How many children left?</p>\\n<p>The giggling girl, the one on the rooftop, the girl with the knife.</p>\\n<p>He could see the tracks now.\\xa0 The largest of the children had broken off.</p>\\n<p>One child, smaller than all of the rest, moving from cover to cover as he followed the soldiers.</p>\\n<p>All the way to Cynthia\\u2019s apartment.</p>\\n<p>Sanguine slowed.</p>\\n<p>The men were gathered at the front, guns in hand, watching, searching the surroundings.</p>\\n<p>He joined them.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s alright?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s fine.\\xa0 She\\u2019s gathering her things.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve got the place surrounded.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou led one of the children here.\\xa0 They know where she is, now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man frowned a little.\\xa0 \\u201cThe entrances and exits are covered.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sanguine studied the area, backing away from the group, his head turning, each eye operating independently.</p>\\n<p>Shingled houses, row on row.\\xa0 A cobbled street.</p>\\n<p>The quiet was broken by a distant, distant rumble.\\xa0 An explosion in Westmore.\\xa0 An hour away.\\xa0 Had to be a big one.</p>\\n<p>Then stillness and quiet again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia!\\u201d Sanguine called out.</p>\\n<p>He saw her face appear in an upstairs window.\\xa0 She peered down at him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOut!\\u201d he called.</p>\\n<p>No sooner was the order given, than a small object flew down from a nearby rooftop.</p>\\n<p>A moment later, there was fire, and the men at one corner of the house were engulfed, screaming struggling.\\xa0 Panic and madness.\\xa0 The front of the building was licked with flame.</p>\\n<p>Sanguine, calm, collected, raised his rifle, eyes focusing.</p>\\n<p>The boy was hiding, using the peak of the rooftop and the chimney for cover.\\xa0 Sanguine took long strides, aiming, looking for a hint of a movement.</p>\\n<p>He heard a bang, on the far side of the house, out of sight.</p>\\n<p>A window opening.</p>\\n<p>He dropped the rifle, running.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay!\\u201d he called out, but too late.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d leaped from the second story window.</p>\\n<p>In the same moment she fell, another grenade was cast down from the rooftop.</p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019s capable in a scrap, but he\\u2019s not even giving her the opportunity.</em></p>\\n<p>As with the first, it expanded into flame.</p>\\n<p>Sanguine saw a glimpse of the boy on the roof, already turning to run, scampering along wet shingles and peaked roofs.\\xa0 He might have had a shot, if he wanted it.\\xa0 Yet Cynthia was flailing, reaching out for help.\\xa0 Every heartbeat counted when it came to saving her.</p>\\n<p>He straddled the fence, a coin flip between one or the other.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d been given orders to leave the Lambs alive.\\xa0 Orders he hadn\\u2019t cared about, as his earlier shot at the boy had evidenced, but given this knife\\u2019s edge of a decision\\u2026 he turned his attention to Cynthia, who was partially engulfed in fire.</p>\\n<p>She could be saved, at least more certainly than the boy could be shot down.</p>\\n<p>Beauty gone.\\xa0 Even the rebellion\\u2019s best doctors would struggle.\\xa0 It would take time to fix.</p>\\n<p>But there was nobody left to work with.\\xa0 Better to have her alive, so he had a place.\\xa0 He\\u2019d have his Lamb-hunt another day.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/20/tooth-and-nail-7-1/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The door slammed shut.\\xa0 The impact rattled her thoughts.\\xa0 Double vision, triple vision, vertigo, but all cognitive, her thoughts alone.</p>\\n<p>One breath blurred into the next, the space between breaths stretched on, adding together, piling onto one another until she realized she was suffocating.\\xa0 She coughed, gasping and wheezing for air.</p>\\n<p>Panic surged in her breast.\\xa0 A bird\\u2019s flutter of emotion, beating harder and more frantically, until it filled her.</p>\\n<p>Then, unsustainable, it was gone.\\xa0 Was it the drugs they were pumping into her that quelled the fear?\\xa0 Did they worry that enough fear and anxiety could tax her brain and kill her?</p>\\n<p>Or had minutes passed, or hours?</p>\\n<p>She screamed, thrashing against her bonds, a cage custom-molded to her body.\\xa0 The scream bounced off of the walls, joining the fresh screams as she caught breath.\\xa0 A momentary catch, a drawn-out process of panting for breath?\\xa0 Both?</p>\\n<p>She tried to figure out which it was, scanning her memory, gathering clues, and lost track of time.\\xa0 She gasped for breath again, having let herself slip, letting the time between breaths become too long.</p>\\n<p><em>Heartbeat, </em>she thought.\\xa0 She fixated on her heartbeat.\\xa0 The steady pulse, accelerated by her fear.\\xa0 It was meditative, calming, a rope to cling to as she drowned in this new sea.</p>\\n<p><em>They stole my sanity</em>, she thought.</p>\\n<p><em>They stole my mind from me.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve hobbled my brain as surely as they crippled my body.\\xa0 </em><em>Until I can get this fixed, I\\u2019ve forever got one additional ball to juggle</em>.</p>\\n<p>There were tears in the corner of her eyes.\\xa0 She struggled again against the bondage, fierce enough she was certain she would hurt something.</p>\\n<p>She had to adjust her mental clock, taking into account the exertion, how it affected the heartbeats she was counting.</p>\\n<p>The lighting seeping in through the crack beneath the door had changed.\\xa0 Was that the flicker of torchlight, or had she been down here long enough for things to change?\\xa0 A different load on the systems of the Academy, leaving more power to go to the lights in the hall?</p>\\n<p>Her heartbeat had calmed, she realized, but she was still using the same measure, her judgment of how many seconds or minutes had just passed was dashed to the wind.</p>\\n<p>Someone moved in front of the door, a shadow passing through that slice of light.</p>\\n<p>Unable to find the words, she screamed at the door.\\xa0 It was a futile thing, a cry for help with no expectation that that help would come.</p>\\n<p>Everything she tried, it was making things worse.\\xa0 She was in the Bowels, a place where she\\u2019d spent a fair amount of time, and she knew how deep they would have put her, how thick the walls were, and how far the trip was to get to the surface.\\xa0 Even once she was there, she would be surrounded by soldiers, she would have to pass through the checkpoint, and pass more soldiers on the road out of the city.</p>\\n<p>It was akin to being beneath the ocean, the weight of all of that water pressing down on her, crushing, wearing her away.</p>\\n<p>Three more times, she lost track of her breathing.\\xa0 Her stomach gurgled, but it wasn\\u2019t hunger.\\xa0 It was suction and air, as a tube worked at the side of her stomach, removing waste, tarry and black.\\xa0 She felt a pressing need to go to the bathroom, but it never got better or worse.\\xa0 Tubes coiled up inside her bladder, most likely.</p>\\n<p>Again, she screamed and thrashed.\\xa0 She wanted to hurt herself, to find some avenue to rub herself raw, do some damage, out of some hope that she could make that damage severe enough to end her existence.\\xa0 It would be a form of control, a way of taking charge of her own destiny.</p>\\n<p>But it was futile.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been trained as a doctor, finishing her education here in Radham.\\xa0 She knew what the tarry black waste meant.\\xa0 She had a bloodspur in her.\\xa0 When her blood pressure was sufficiently high, the device would bleed her, dumping the blood into her stomach.\\xa0 New or artificial blood was fed in through tubes.\\xa0 She couldn\\u2019t bleed herself out, not realistically.\\xa0 If she was wounded, the bloodspur would cease working, and the wound would take over its duties of slowly emptying out the blood the tubes gave her.</p>\\n<p>She was exhausted but unable to sleep.\\xa0 Again and again, she struggled, because there was nothing else to do with herself.\\xa0 Again and again, she lost track of her breathing as she got too deep in thought.</p>\\n<p>Tears streaked down her face.\\xa0 She recovered.</p>\\n<p>She screamed again, howling to see if she couldn\\u2019t scream her voice raw.\\xa0 The seam in her chest where they\\u2019d done surgery threatened to pop from the strain.</p>\\n<p>The door opened.\\xa0 The light was blinding.</p>\\n<p>Had she been in the dark that long?\\xa0 Or was it drugs and a perpetual state of blood loss?</p>\\n<p>The Duke and his coterie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry for the delay,\\u201d he remarked.\\xa0 His expression was placid compared to hers, as she panted for breath.\\xa0 \\u201cI wanted to have a conversation with the Lambs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She stared at him, uncomprehending.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you remember the terms of our last discussion?\\u201d he asked, his voice eerily smooth and deep.\\xa0 Artificial.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said, and her voice was hoarse.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to ask you a question.\\xa0 Yes or no answers only.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said, again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWill you provide the locations of each of the other cells?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She considered for a moment, but again, time threatened to slip away from her.\\xa0 After half a second -or was it a minute?- the Duke turned to leave.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She opened her mouth to speak, then remembered his warning and closed it again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know where Percy is.\\xa0 Cynthia handled the coordination between groups.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He gestured at a doctor, \\u201cThe mask.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said I had permission to speak!\\u201d she cried out, struggling, trying to pull her face away as the doctor lifted the tube and the grasping bloodsucker toward her mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t say I\\u2019d favor the answer,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cTake some time to think it over.\\xa0 I hope you\\u2019ll come up with clues about his whereabouts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The tube slid down her throat.\\xa0 The device locked around her jaw and the back of her head, connecting to the table.</p>\\n<p>The lights went out, and again, the door slammed shut.</p>\\n<p>This time, she still needed to regulate her breathing, but it was through the nose alone.\\xa0 She couldn\\u2019t scream, she couldn\\u2019t measure her breaths.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There once was a girl named Mavis.\\xa0 People all around her got sick, half the people in the town she grew up in.\\xa0 It got worse and worse, people hacking and coughing, until the Academy arrived.\\xa0 The best doctors, checking, giving care, not unkind people.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Had everything gone according to plan, it would have been a positive experience for her, a reason to respect and favor the Academy.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Except Simon Weltsch had fought in the war, and he said there was a more sinister explanation.\\xa0 The Academy had made them sick, testing a drug on the village\\u2019s population without permission.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She never found out if that was true or not, and as head of communications for Radham, she\\u2019d made use of every resource available to her to try and find out.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t to say Simon was spewing utter nonsense.\\xa0 After becoming a student, she had researched the testing of drugs on communities, but the casualties were low to nonexistent, the rate of advancement high.\\xa0 Without paperwork or records to tie back to her community in particular, it never quite hit home to the point that she could get angry about it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She wished she could say that Simon Weltsch\\u2019s unexplained and gruesome death had woken her up to reality.\\xa0 It was accepted across the community that the Academy had done the deed to silence the dissident, but everyone was healthy and nobody had wanted to stick their head up, Mavis among them.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She\\u2019d eaten dinner with her parents, gone for long walks and talked with her friends, and flirted with boys.\\xa0 As she came of age, she started studying, and earned a place at the Academy, abbreviating her name as soon as she fixed on her preferred area of study.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">No, Avis\\u2019 problem had never quite been with the Academy.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Her first winter holiday back home, she had been excited to share her tales of being at the academy.\\xa0 Avis had met with friends for tea.\\xa0 The boys who\\u2019d been farmers and laborers trickled into the bar, and she\\u2019d remarked on how few were turning up.\\xa0 Then she had heard.\\xa0 No, not gone to war.\\xa0 Had it been that, she might have been able to justify it as necessary evil.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Three nobles had come into town, young ladies not much older than she was, gallivanting around.\\xa0 The noblewomen had asked for the company of young men, and the young men had not been in a position to refuse.\\xa0 When they left, they took the most handsome with them.\\xa0 Avis\\u2019 girlfriends had joked that it wasn\\u2019t much loss, the noblewomen being so attractive, but she hadn\\u2019t missed the emotion beneath the words.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There had been only one letter back since the boys had left, and it had read like it had been written carefully, so as not to offend any who read it before it reached home.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It had taken some time for Avis to come to terms with her feelings over that.\\xa0 Life had gone on as normal, with some farmers getting help from the community to make up for the labor their sons weren\\u2019t providing.\\xa0 Where war was a necessary evil, this didn\\u2019t feel evil at all, and it most definitely did not feel necessary.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It hadn\\u2019t been the blow that destroyed her loyalty to the Crown, but it had been a wedge, and every story or idea that touched on the Crown drove that wedge in deeper.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Avis stared into the Duke\\u2019s eyes.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDo I need to repeat the question?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She opened her mouth, then closed it.\\xa0 She felt painful bumps here and there where the inside of her mouth had been rubbed by the gag.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWill you tell me the location of your loved ones.\\xa0 Your mother, father, siblings, cousins, and the friends you wrote to while you were first studying in the Academy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She\\u2019d given up.\\xa0 She was defeated.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYour father?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHe\\u2019s in Iverchester.\\xa0 With my mother and youngest sibling,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 His eyes seemed to swallow her up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYour older sister?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe said she would\\u2026 she could find work in Burry, teaching.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYour friends?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cJanice is in Chells, Tory is in Uskham.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She could hear the damning scratch as the details were taken down by a doctor in the back.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cPlease,\\u201d her voice was so quiet she could barely hear it.\\xa0 She stared at the Duke\\u2019s collar, \\u201cMy lord.\\xa0 Anything else you want to know, sit me down, take me out of here, I\\u2019ll share it if you fix my mind.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 I will do anything you want.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve won.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cExcept sitting quiet and giving only yes or no answers, or answering my questions,\\u201d the Duke\\u2019s voice murmured back to her.\\xa0 His tone was gentle, a light rebuke, and Avis couldn\\u2019t shake the notion that this was what it sounded like when a father told their child that cookies were for <em>after</em> dinner.\\xa0 The Duke\\u2019s voice, rich, deep, and authoritarian, was as a child imagined their father sounding.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou hurt children, Avis.\\xa0 Kidnapped them off the streets, <em>my</em> streets, and put them on the table.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t me.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t the people I was working for.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cA blatant lie if I ever heard one,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 He kicked something under the table that held her and then changed the angle, lying her flat.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCynthia was hurt, Godwin killed.\\xa0 The group is in disarray, there are two factions now.\\xa0 One side wants to stop the Academy, the other wants to stop the Crown.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd which are you, Avis?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m not- not anymore.\\xa0 I won\\u2019t go against you again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cStop stating the obvious.\\xa0 Of <em>course</em> nobody ever goes against me a second time.\\xa0 Answer the question.\\xa0 Which are you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI was \\u2013<em>was- </em>against the Crown.\\xa0 The others, the ones who want to hurt the Academy, they\\u2019re desperate, they\\u2019re angry, they want to win an ever-escalating contest of strength.\\xa0 They have other ideas in mind.\\xa0 Breaking rules the <em>Academy</em> won\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">One of the Duke\\u2019s doctors was positioning a tool, a mechanical arm, so it was poised above her head.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A needle speared straight toward her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Her breathing picked up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou coordinated for them.\\xa0 Passed on messages.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI did, but-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re bending the truth to put yourself in a better light, Avis,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou convinced yourself that Percy\\u2019s actions were acceptable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo.\\xa0 But it wasn\\u2019t like he listened when I sent a letter.\\xa0 If I\\u2019d reacted or tried to take action, I risked my life.\\xa0 I had to play along, hope the others would coordinate, pull the two groups together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI know of other things you\\u2019ve been complicit in.\\xa0 The white plague in Danes, the ravager of Arwick.\\xa0 You believe in what you\\u2019re doing.\\xa0 Short term harm for long-term betterment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt- yes.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not so different from what the Academy does?\\u201d she made it a question.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The Duke\\u2019s expression changed, the light smile fading away.\\xa0 \\u201cThe sacrifice of a child?\\xa0 No, I suppose not.\\xa0 I do suppose it falls on my shoulders.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She wanted to inquire about that, but the movement of the machinery and the swaying of the needle occupied her attention.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t find the voice to question what he meant.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe difference is you failed in the end,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere will be no betterment, only harm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The mechanical arm with the needle came down, dropping a solid foot.\\xa0 It jerked to a stop a half-inch from Avis\\u2019 eye.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A doctor gripped her eye in between gloved fingertip and thumb, forcing her to look straight at the needle.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The mechanical arm dropped another inch.\\xa0 Avis didn\\u2019t even have time to vocalize a response.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI believe in justice,\\u201d the Duke said.\\xa0 \\u201cPunishment where it\\u2019s due.\\xa0 I told you the rules, you had enough time to consider them.\\xa0 This is your punishment, just as your decision as a whole have led to you being in this room.\\xa0 If and when it comes to pass that my work ends in more harm than betterment, I hope my reckoning will come.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Avis managed to find the breath to speak, as a doctor manipulated her other eye, forcing her to stare up at a second needle.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease.\\xa0 How long have I been here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The second needle came down.\\xa0 Her eyes were speared, locked into position.\\xa0 There was no pain, not physical pain, but she knew the effect this would have on her mind and her already impaired ability to track time.\\xa0 She felt the gag slip into place, slithering down her throat.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHow long have you been here?\\xa0 I think that would be telling,\\u201d the Duke said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The door slammed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She woke, which was a strange thing that had been happening lately.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t supposed to sleep, but she took it as the resiliency of the brain, finding a way.\\xa0 Her entire body hurt, and she had a headache unlike any she\\u2019d ever had before.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She moved her eyes, and her vision was blurry.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Avis raised her arm, as she\\u2019d tried to do so many times before, and this time the restraints didn\\u2019t stop her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Pages were scattered around the room.\\xa0 There was a matchbox sitting on a table in the corner, but it looked as though the slamming of the door had generated a gust, blowing it away from the stack of papers it had been weighing down.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Her movements were ginger.\\xa0 She remembered what she\\u2019d been told, about alterations to her joints.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Her muscles should have atrophied.\\xa0 Her joints were disabled, the bones shaved or implants put in to make them easy to dislocate.\\xa0 She could feel the pain, which meant the drugs to dull pain were no longer coursing through her, and hadn\\u2019t been for a little while.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She staggered across the room, nearly falling.\\xa0 Bending down, she picked up papers.\\xa0 Each was one half of a sheet of paper that had been torn in half.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The order of them was hard to decipher, and the blur in the dead center of her vision made it harder still to read.\\xa0 Ingrained into her by years of education, the habit of reading made her eyes want to slip onto each line of tight cursive writing, instead of holding above the line, piecing together the meaning of each statement.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>The Duke has been visiting you less and less.\\xa0 I have been visiting you more and more.\\xa0 Soon, I think, he intends to visit you, to make you useful.\\xa0 If I acted any sooner, you wouldn\\u2019t have been strong enough.\\xa0 If I acted too late, you would be his</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She gathered sentences here, fragments there, not sure on the order of the pages, not when she could barely read.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Injections to your shoulders and hips.\\xa0 Minor repairs, some minor surgery.\\xa0 I accessed channels outside of your room, that I knew would feed into your blood supply.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hands shaking, she sorted through the various pages.</p>\\n<p><em>Do not look for your family or friends.\\xa0 You will only find unhappiness at best, and fall into the Crown\\u2019s trap again at worst.\\xa0 Be wary in seeking old acquaintances, though reasons are different.\\xa0 What was a war between two sides has become a war between three.\\xa0 Old friends may not be friends anymore.</em></p>\\n<p>She trembled, hands unable to find the gap between two pages.</p>\\n<p><em>The advised escape route is the drainage tunnel to Claret Hall.\\xa0 From there, you should be able to reach the Tower by using the dark avenues between the storage buildings.\\xa0 The Tower will get you high enough to glide over the wall.</em></p>\\n<p>Another.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Internal components and tubes have been removed on this visit.\\xa0 I leave you my words, which I hope you will burn, and a present for the winter holidays</em>, <em>admittedly belated.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Two seasons, Avis realized.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>I need to act, and I have no freedom.\\xa0 We\\u2019re speeding headlong into disaster, and you\\u2019re the only person I can think of who could pass on a message.\\xa0 Burn the papers if you have any gratitude for your freedom.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The writing, she realized, was digging deeper into the page as the writer had gone on.\\xa0 Intensity, urgency.\\xa0 She could recognize the difference between papers now, the thickness of letters and amount of excess ink.\\xa0 She\\u2019d already read some of it out of order.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She found the last piece of paper.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>The tallest hill outside of Radham.\\xa0 It has a view of the approach.\\xa0 The message is such: It is time to step in.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Avis stared down at the paper, then crumpled it, and set it on the table, being careful to put a match to every part of it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">While it burned, she set to looking for her gift.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was tucked in a corner \\u2013 a small box.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She reached inside, and she withdrew wings.\\xa0 Not hers, but similar.\\xa0 The bends in the wings had hook-like fingers.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She put them on, feeling them bite into flesh, a little less merciful than her old wings had been.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A single revolver and a trio of syringes, each one capped, sat on the bottom, tucked neatly in the corner, stowed in the gap just left of a set of clothes.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She\\u2019d had enough time to think, trapped in a hell of her own making.\\xa0 The Duke\\u2019s words rattled around in her head even now, taunting her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She changed clothes, pulling off the hospital dress and donning the provided clothes.\\xa0 Loose pants like a sailor might wear, boots, and a harness top she could wear with her wings.\\xa0 She touched her head and found her hair short.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Dressing didn\\u2019t make her feel more human.\\xa0 She felt cold inside.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Her hatred for the Duke had cooled from a burning hatred to an ice cold hate.\\xa0 She wouldn\\u2019t bat an eye if she had an opportunity to hurt him.\\xa0 She knew she might destroy herself for the chance.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Yet, even though she was able to collect the syringes, she found herself hesitating when it came time to collect the gun.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She\\u2019d hurt people in a casual way, facilitating what she had.\\xa0 Letting Percy do what he had.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">So easy to do when she was in the stride of it, but after having had time alone with her own thoughts, it didn\\u2019t sit nearly as easy.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She turned away, hauling open the door, feeling grateful as her shoulder withstood the strain.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The gun was left behind.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Rather than let the door slam, as it had innumerable times before, she gently closed it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was the dead of night.\\xa0 There were no people on the staircase leading up and out of the underground labs.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She was as quiet as the situation allowed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was dreamlike, and her altered state of awareness didn\\u2019t help matters.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t convinced this wasn\\u2019t a hallucination.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Her body was light, she\\u2019d altered her bone structure long ago, removing sections of organs to lower her body weight while maintaining the same rough frame.\\xa0 Her diet while lying on the table had been different, but it hadn\\u2019t added any pounds that she could notice.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She flexed her wings as much as she was able, given the narrow space between railing and wall, and continued to ascend.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Passing a hallway, she saw a pale expanse, rather than dark, barely-lit hallway.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Her heart skipped a beat as she realized what it was.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gorger made noise as he hauled himself out of the hallway, a matter of feet behind her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As quiet as she\\u2019d been, Gorger was loud.\\xa0 He covered surprising amounts of ground, feet tromping on stairs, one hand regularly reaching up to seize handholds, moving like a loping gorilla rather than a very obese giant of a man.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She found the needle, squeezed out the air in the syringe, and she jammed it into her own heart.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Strength, energy, perception.\\xa0 It flowed through her quickly, as fast as her heart beat.\\xa0 She was able to move faster, more securely, using her light body to its fullest, as the pain faded away.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Absolute terror at what awaited her if she were caught gave her the extra push she needed.\\xa0 She knew she\\u2019d rather fall and die than get caught, and that gave her the courage to step up onto the railing, wings spread, and leap, aiming for a hole in the wall.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gorger saw what she was doing.\\xa0 Rather than give chase, he slammed his hand against the wall, hard.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The underground labs rumbled.\\xa0 Things began to fall into place, a domino effect expanding out in ten different ways from the place Gorger\\u2019s hand had struck the wall.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But the underground labs were built around a massive silo, a cylinder set deep into the ground, and the effect had to reach around the edges of the cylinder.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She didn\\u2019t hesitate, even as she saw the slab of stone falling into place.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She passed under the slab, full speed, wings spread, and the slab came down behind her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">With no time to waste, knowing Gorger would be calling the alarm, she ran for Claret Hall.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She passed through one section of tunnel that had no lighting.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And she was back on the table, unable to move, body paralyzed, unable to breathe.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A dream?\\xa0 A hallucination?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Flashback.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She floundered, struggled, and hauled herself to her feet.\\xa0 Without her face down in a half-foot of water, she was able to breathe again.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Only a flashback.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She was still running, still making her escape.\\xa0 But it was too easy to slip back into that same timeless place she\\u2019d spent so long.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There were so many questions and not a one of them mattered.\\xa0 Who had rescued her, why?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">By fighting forward like this, obeying the letters, she was risking doing the exact same thing that had gotten her in this mess in the first place.\\xa0 Reckless action, lack of forethought, approaching her future at a run, without watching her step or paying attention to what happened in her wake.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She was in Claret Hall, she realized.\\xa0 This was tricky.\\xa0 The way out meant coming up out of the wine cellar, into the building.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d plotted escape routes enough that this wasn\\u2019t too hard.\\xa0 Into empty offices, through the washroom.\\xa0 A window large enough for her to fit through.\\xa0 She passed into a shadowy space between buildings, and crossed to another.</p>\\n<p>A distant alarm was getting picked up by closer buildings.\\xa0 As it was heard and people found the switches, the alarm was passed on.\\xa0 It swept past her, and people in uniforms started to exit building in groups.</p>\\n<p>Soon, the stitched would be roused and directed.\\xa0 The Academy\\u2019s security would quintuple at the very least, and she would have nowhere to go.</p>\\n<p>She was so fixated on watching what was going on that she didn\\u2019t wholly connect to the fact that she was tramping on something that crunched underfoot.</p>\\n<p>Frozen grass.\\xa0 Patches of snow caught mid-thaw, frozen over by rain.</p>\\n<p>It would have to be spring.</p>\\n<p>Three seasons, all in all.</p>\\n<p>It was a realization that spurred her on further, into the labyrinthine maze of warehouses and storerooms.\\xa0 Driven by fear, she made a break for the tower, the biggest open space yet.</p>\\n<p>She was glad her wings were black, and not white as the old ones had been, as she approached the door.</p>\\n<p>People left the Tower in a group.\\xa0 A small army of stitched.</p>\\n<p>She danced away to the side, taking cover against the side of the building.</p>\\n<p>They were spreading out, organizing into groups.</p>\\n<p>She had no place to go except <em>up</em>.</p>\\n<p>With the hooks on her wings and her own frozen fingers, she scrabbled for a grip on the surface of the tower.\\xa0 She climbed, cold stone and petrified wood leeching her body heat with every moment of contact.\\xa0 Fingers scraped raw against mortar and frost, and she hauled herself up, circling around to put the body of the Tower between herself and the rest of the Academy.</p>\\n<p>Her perception of time was something of a blessing and a curse.\\xa0 It let her climb more carefully, devoting her focus to the moment, but it felt like she was climbing an endless, infinite tower.\\xa0 Blood ran from fingertip to wrist and down to the crook of her elbow.</p>\\n<p>As she got higher up, there were more windows.\\xa0 She gauged her ability to glide over, and she had doubts.</p>\\n<p>She couldn\\u2019t even guess at her chance of getting spotted, were she to climb up and over.</p>\\n<p>Avis decided to compromise, raising herself up, so the bottom of the window was at eye level, peering left and right.</p>\\n<p>No movement.</p>\\n<p>She climbed, and was standing with stomach to the glass when she saw him.</p>\\n<p>A single figure, a boy.</p>\\n<p><em>One of the Lambs?</em></p>\\n<p>No, this one had red hair.</p>\\n<p>Paralyzed, she finally managed to move, raising a hand, finger pressed to her mouth.</p>\\n<p>The boy only stared at her with amber eyes.</p>\\n<p>It unnerved, and it made her think of the wrongs she\\u2019d committed, the children Percy had used, that the Lambs had executed so thoroughly.</p>\\n<p>As if recoiling, she threw herself back, twisting so her belly faced the ground, wings extending, and glided.</p>\\n<p>Avis didn\\u2019t pass over the wall, but she was able to grab it.\\xa0 She heard shouts and calls, and heard a trumpet, then hauled herself over and beyond, as guns fired from a distance.</p>\\n<p>She was free.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d escaped, but she didn\\u2019t <em>feel</em> free.</p>\\n<p>She made her way to the tallest hill, feeling trepidation.</p>\\n<p>There were three figures waiting for her.\\xa0 When she landed, it was to crumple into a heap.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t even raise her head.</p>\\n<p>A hand reached for her.\\xa0 She flinched involuntarily, and the hand withdrew.</p>\\n<p>She knew who the hand belonged to.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFray,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were trying to contact you for a while,\\u201d Avis said.\\xa0 Her voice didn\\u2019t sound like her own.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s been a while, Avis.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Avis nodded.\\xa0 She fidgeted, because being too still made it feel like the walls of that room were closing in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s- I\\u2019m supposed to tell you\\u2026\\u201d Avis started.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t finish.\\xa0 Her voice broke.\\xa0 She curled up into a ball, folding her wings around herself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Genevieve Fray said.</p>\\n<p>Another hand touched her, and this one was very warm in the cold winter.\\xa0 She flinched, at first, but this one was persistent.\\xa0 It became a hug, and the hug was welcome.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re with the right people,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>Avis shook her head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t- I\\u2019m not a soldier anymore.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t touch the gun.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t be part of this.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t stand the Crown but I can\\u2019t fight them either, I-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s fine,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to, to stay with us.\\xa0 The Crown States have two major factions who are trying to destroy the Crown, they don\\u2019t need <em>us</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>We\\u2019re</em> saving humanity,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cCome on.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Rather than Fray, it was the giant of a man who offered Avis a hand.</p>\\n<p>Staring at his hand, she felt he was kindred, gentle.</p>\\n<p>Looking in his eyes, however, she saw a terrible anger, no doubt worse for her being reflected in it.</p>\\n<p>That was as comforting as anything.</p>\\n<p><a

chin.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSomeone shoved a door into me,\\u201d I said, glancing back at Gordon.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re welcome,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI appreciate the rescue.\\xa0 The sentiment, anyway.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Now it was his turn to shoot <em>me</em> a look.\\xa0 I was going to say something, but Lillian grabbed my chin, lifting it up.\\xa0 She patted at it with a pad that smelled like something burnt.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe almost missed you,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe went to the yard, then we were going to split up from there.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t think you\\u2019d be straight<em> down</em> from the dorm room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI saw the smoke at the chimney,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought it was the kitchen, but Jamie knew the layout better than I did, and we found our way down here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGood as my memory might be, I\\u2019m not in top form when I\\u2019ve just woken up.\\xa0 We went to the wrong end of the hall.\\xa0 There are multiple furnaces for different sections of the building.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Slow to get things moving</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI feel terrible I almost fucked up,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt would have been better to follow you first, <em>then</em> gone to get Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey would have seen you and adjusted the plan,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis would have gone worse if it was the two of us instead of just me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHow\\u2019s that?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe could have hurt Jamie to pressure me, or done it the other way around.\\xa0 Being alone, I could build a rapport.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou could have gotten shot,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhen push came to shove, she missed.\\xa0 I think there was a reason she missed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMore than her being pressed for time?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s been imprinted with set behaviors, but she\\u2019s still human, with hopes and fears.\\xa0 Right now, she\\u2019s uncertain, very possibly more than she\\u2019s ever been in her whole life.\\xa0 Her creator more or less had a monopoly on how she behaved.\\xa0 Grow a child in a vat, imprint them with behaviors that fit the grand plan, stick them in school to surround them with people to mimic and model themselves after, step in now and again to reinforce, shape behavior and train.\\xa0 I\\u2019m the first real challenge to her reality.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve got her questioning things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou make <em>me</em> question my reality,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHa ha,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Lillian examined my hands, turning them face-up.\\xa0 She had to squint to see, but she put the powder on the bases of my palms, where I\\u2019d scuffed them on the floor during my fall.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the next step?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSy\\u2019s call,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI gave her ideas and things to worry about.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019s going to check in with her compatriots here.\\xa0 It would increase the chance of running into us a second time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou don\\u2019t think she\\u2019s confident about their abilities?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cShe threw that hatchet like a pro.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe\\u2019s confident in her abilities.\\xa0 But that\\u2019s not where I hit her.\\xa0 It\\u2019s called <em>dissonance</em>.\\xa0 You believe one thing deeply enough that it\\u2019s central to your identity.\\xa0 Then something, <em>me</em>, steps in to challenge that belief.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a hell of a leap of faith to go from believing something and understanding how much of the world works, to saying \\u2018I don\\u2019t know\\u2019.\\xa0 Some deny, and you can get stupid-as-hell behaviors from those who see something plain as day but deny it because it conflicts with something they believe.\\xa0 Some get angry, some distract themselves until they can figure out how to deal with it\\u2026 but very few will turn around and throw themselves headlong into <em>more</em> questions.\\xa0 <em>More</em> dissonance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf she\\u2019s not going to her old friends-\\u201d Jamie started.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhich would force her to face the questions,\\u201d I cut in.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOr coming after us-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cRisks even <em>more</em> questions,\\u201d I added.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie frowned at my interruptions.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s going another place, another route.\\xa0 Who is she?\\xa0 How does she operate?\\xa0 Will she try to escape her worries by fulfilling her mission?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI told her that if she tries, she might well lose herself to her imprinted behaviors.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think so.\\xa0 She\\u2019ll want answers, I think we should track her and get some answers for ourselves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe just covered her trail pretty well there,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIs it even possible?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s possible,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe know where she\\u2019s going.\\xa0 She\\u2019s going to pay a visit to her creator.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhich would be great if we knew who he was,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt would,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s not going to be in the school.\\xa0 If it was another kind of project, maybe it could be hidden, but if I\\u2019m right, and these are clones grown in tubes, then it\\u2019s too big a task.\\xa0 Even ignoring that, she\\u2019s trained.\\xa0 That takes time, and it takes space.\\xa0 You need room to swing weapons around or practice your aim with a pistol.\\xa0 A school with thirty members of faculty and over a thousand students isn\\u2019t going to give you that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOff-campus, can\\u2019t be too far away,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow often would this training happen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cTraining, instructions, shaping behavior,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d guess once a week?\\xa0 Can\\u2019t say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf they are vat-grown,\\u201d Helen said, \\u201cThen they\\u2019d need training on other fronts.\\xa0 How to be human, basic niceties.\\xa0 How to use silverware, how to talk\\u2026 it might not take too long, but they need to be able to pass.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cA house,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s more <em>what</em> we\\u2019re looking for than <em>where</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWith a kitchen, clothes\\u2026\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cRoom to move around,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a small house with walls shared with anyone else.\\xa0 Neighbors would get suspicious and complain about the noise just as much as anyone else.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd,\\u201d Jamie said, \\u201cThere\\u2019s the question of how you make a child act well enough like their former self to pass muster with the child\\u2019s own parents.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gordon frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cI really don\\u2019t want to run away with the wrong idea here.\\xa0 If we go chasing after a wild goose, we might not get another opportunity to get them.\\xa0 How sure are you, Sy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I leaned against the wall.\\xa0 Lillian finished checking me over, and moved over to Gordon.\\xa0 She began unbuttoning his shirt.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHow sure?\\xa0 Um.\\xa0 It fits.\\xa0 The little detail thing that Jamie was oh-so-recently trying to get me to focus on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHe wasn\\u2019t there for that conversation,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWasn\\u2019t he?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said, very patiently.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gordon grunted as Lillian pushed his shoulder back into the socket.\\xa0 She had him go through a range of motions, extending his arm and moving it around.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWell, Jamie was talking about the little things that we don\\u2019t necessarily pay attention to, that still register in the subconscious.\\xa0 I made a point of calling Mary an <em>experiment</em>, part of my trying to build a rapport with her.\\xa0 She never called me out on it or sounded uncomfortable with the idea.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think she\\u2019s ever had illusions about being anything else.\\xa0 She paid a lot of attention when I talked about roles, identity, labels.\\xa0 Part of that is going to this school, but part of it is that she\\u2019s acting out a role, and has been for a long time.\\xa0 Whatever\\u2019s going on with her, it runs deep.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOne student died and was autopsied,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe rest burned.\\xa0 Wouldn\\u2019t a clone turn up on autopsies?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMoment I heard about the remainder being burned, I thought maybe they missed something in the first autopsy, and our puppeteer went out of his way to risk a second close call.\\xa0 But I don\\u2019t know for sure whether it would show up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">After a pause, we collectively turned to Lillian.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt depends on a lot,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t tell us anything,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDon\\u2019t be a butthole, Sy,\\u201d Jamie told me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I rolled my eyes.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf he tried to accelerate growth, which he must have, then there\\u2019s a good chance something would show up.\\xa0 There are chemical ways to promote aging.\\xa0 Hormones, substances, alter the seventh ratio.\\xa0 But those substances turn up, and they have effects.\\xa0 Any drug is like a puzzle piece.\\xa0 We flood the body with puzzle pieces of a particular shape, and intend for those pieces to fit into a specific place and enact a specific function, but you can\\u2019t stop it from connecting to other sites, enacting other functions.\\xa0 It\\u2019s how we get side effects.\\xa0 We control it with how we deliver the medication and other factors, and some of the best graduates of the Academy have it down to an <em>art, </em>making it so one drug only affects one thing in one way, but that\\u2019s a delicate balancing act.\\xa0 That\\u2019s without getting into the fact that a badly made clone might be more prone to wear, tear, and side effects.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIs our guy that good?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cEnough to have the aging drugs down to an art, hiding symptoms from an autopsy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut if what Sy said is true, I\\u2019d say he isn\\u2019t.\\xa0 He has one area of focus and he\\u2019s giving his all in pursuing it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe second method is more complimentary, then.\\xa0 Altering the fundamental pattern of the clones.\\xa0 Humans mature at an exceptionally slow rate.\\xa0 We saw people try this a decade ago in the Indian Empire.\\xa0 Crown scientists tried to make a slave class that grew to maturity, with a specific level of intelligence.\\xa0 Domesticated humans, strong, playful, good natured, attractive, and obedient.\\xa0 If I\\u2019m not mistaken, they tried a lot of things, including imprinted behaviors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Like Mary?\\xa0 </em>I raised my eyebrows.\\xa0 \\u201cHow did it go?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHow do you think it went, Sy?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you see slaves everywhere?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat\\u2019s not saying it didn\\u2019t <em>work</em>,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s pretty damn indicative,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGuys, guys,\\u201d Jamie cut in.\\xa0 \\u201cFocus.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 We need to figure out a direction to go, here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt involves other problems,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cLike the drugs and hormones, it\\u2019s an art unto itself.\\xa0 It requires precision of a different sort, and a broad kind of knowledge.\\xa0 There\\u2019s prior work to draw on, other projects that tried similar things, but there would be signs of the attempt that would crop up in an autopsy, unless the work was <em>perfect</em>.\\xa0 Change one thing in the pattern, and it has ripple effects throughout the organism\\u2019s development and makeup.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI didn\\u2019t realize it was that difficult,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOh my god.\\xa0 It really, really is,\\u201d Lillian said, eyes wide, the incredulity she wasn\\u2019t voicing clear in her expression.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAgain, if our puppeteer was that good, why the hell isn\\u2019t he already employed by the Academy and earning a small fortune for his talents?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 A rhetorical question.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Many of us were nodding.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGot any more suggestions, Lillian?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause this is <em>good</em>.\\xa0 Very useful.\\xa0 But I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s screaming \\u2018this is our guy\\u2019.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cFor accelerating aging?\\xa0 Those would be the best routes,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are others, but I think I\\u2019d be wasting our time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThen we\\u2019re stuck,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Not exactly.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a third possibility,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe more, but I\\u2019m only thinking of three.\\xa0 It kind of complicates things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGo on,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDon\\u2019t,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t accelerate the aging.\\xa0 If you need them to age, you make them age by letting <em>time pass</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMary is twelve,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s had this plan in the works for twelve years?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYes,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cExcept not exactly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I opened my mouth, and Jamie shot me a look.\\xa0 I closed my mouth before he called me a butthole again for my poking fun at Lillian.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI said it complicates things,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause our \\u2018puppeteer\\u2019 could strike a balance.\\xa0 <em>Some</em> natural aging.\\xa0 <em>Some</em> hormones or changes to the pattern.\\xa0 The more he relies on real time passing, the less he needs to accelerate the process.\\xa0 Maybe this project has only been in the works for nine years, or six.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMeaning there could be clues,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cOnes that slipped through in the autopsy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore time to develop them,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cEither he inserts them while they\\u2019re young, where a half-socialized clone might go unnoticed amid rabid and rambunctious first graders, or he waits and he observes their real counterpart, and he trains the clones to mime the behaviors in his off-hours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 We were wondering why he picked <em>Mary</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHer parents don\\u2019t seem important.\\xa0 But if this project has been in the works for a while\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe we should be looking at who they <em>were</em>,\\u201d Gordon finished for me.\\xa0 \\u201cOr who they were supposed to become.\\xa0 Our puppeteer was taking stabs in the dark, this could be a stab that <em>missed</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can look into that end of things, given time,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe might not have a lot of time, but go for it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAfter you direct me to wherever student records are stored.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBy the front entrance.\\xa0 Below the front office.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Great.\\xa0 </em>I\\u2019m going.\\xa0 It\\u2019s better if I\\u2019m not here.\\xa0 Assuming Mary hasn\\u2019t communicated anything to her fellow clones, they\\u2019ll assume I\\u2019m dead.\\xa0 Play it up, act upset and distressed.\\xa0 Stick together, try to keep them distracted and occupied.\\xa0 Best case scenario, they\\u2019ll still think I\\u2019m dead and I can catch them off guard when I\\u2019m back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you do, don\\u2019t try to fight them,\\u201d Gordon said, his expression blank.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re trained, I know,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat, too,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I frowned, but I was already heading toward the stairs, so I turned on the spot, switching to walking backward, if only to make my expression as clear as possible.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d I spoke up.</p>\\n<p>She looked at me, a crease between her eyebrows.\\xa0 Annoyance, worry?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat Academy know-how you just dropped on us?\\xa0 That was good.\\xa0 Smart stuff.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>If anything, the crease between her eyebrows deepened.\\xa0 Her mouth moved, the start of a frown.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t see the rest of it.\\xa0 I headed up the stairs, taking them two at a time, very nearly silent.\\xa0 I ducked low and peered into the darkness to check the way was clear.\\xa0 Only when I was on the move again did I spare Lillian\\u2019s expression another thought.\\xa0 I\\u2019d given her a compliment, and she\\u2019d reacted like I\\u2019d slapped her in the face.</p>\\n<p><em>Dissonance, </em>I realized.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The school\\u2019s prison-like elements turned out to make being stealthy <em>remarkably</em> difficult.\\xa0 The rooms were large and every single one, bathrooms excepted, had a window, either facing out into the street or inward, at the yard.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t very well turn on the lights without the room illuminating and risking that people half of the Academy\\u2019s rooms could see through their windows.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My movements through the front office, thus, were done with the benefit of and detriment of darkness.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The doors, I had to assume, were locked.\\xa0 At the same time, people were far worse about attending to windows.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Water ran down over me and through my hair while I scaled the wooden branches and twigs that grew into and around the masonry.\\xa0 It was far finer than the usual, not quite <em>branches</em> but not so thin as to be ivy, it was thorny, to discourage children in the yard from climbing on it, but it was still a place where I could find handholds, if I was careful to do it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">All the same, I was left bleeding in no less than five places; I couldn\\u2019t always see the thorns in the dark.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I reached the window and teased it open.\\xa0 I slipped inside, then closed it behind me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Glancing outside, I didn\\u2019t see any lights going on, suggesting that a faculty member might have seen the dark shape scaling the paler wall.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie had told me that the records were kept beneath the front office, and my experience with the headmistress had suggested the office\\u2019s location.\\xa0 Rather than go straight for the records, I found myself in the room between the front entrance and the principal\\u2019s office.\\xa0 Typewriters sat on desks where the secretaries were stationed, benches lined one half of the room, and desks and cabinets of papers and supplies filled the other half.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The principal\\u2019s office, once I found it with its name plate on the door, proved to be unlocked.\\xa0 I was glad I didn\\u2019t have to go out and back in again.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The interior of her office had a desk and chair, cabinets, some pictures meant to impress parents more than please herself or her students.\\xa0 There were prominent faces I couldn\\u2019t name depicted on the wall.\\xa0 Gradutes of Academies.\\xa0 A \\u2018this could be your student in ten years\\u2019 thing.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But I knew that however good she was, few people remembered every detail about every single one of the people who worked under them.\\xa0 If some of her staff slept in the building, some slept out, she still needed a means of contacting them.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I found a box of notecards, filled with teacher\\u2019s names and mailing addresses.\\xa0 I took it with me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Humans were complex creatures.\\xa0 Add the rewriting of patterns, augmentations, grafts, revival, drugs, and everything else, and \\u2018human\\u2019 became an awfully unclear term.\\xa0 Every new discovery meant the introduction of things that had never been done or discovered before, more things that muddied the waters.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Or bloodied them.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My \\u2018gang\\u2019 was muddy and bloody both, but they were fairly simple, with defined roles.\\xa0 Here, in this, I was the odd one out.\\xa0 If all five of the other projects were successes, I might never have been given the go-ahead.\\xa0 It was sobering, to know that the foundation and excuse for my being rested on the backs of two corpses.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Two who were like me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I\\u2019d been asked, once, how I could predict people as I did.\\xa0 Jamie, I think, had raised the subject.\\xa0 My answer had been simple.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Humans as a species were like a collection of bugs in a box.\\xa0 Left alone, it was hard to predict how they\\u2019d move, or the patterns that would form.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Shake the box, and it generated <em>chaos</em>.\\xa0 Maddened, they would seek to escape, butting their heads against barriers.\\xa0 They would turn on their closest neighbors and strike out.\\xa0 Even seek to kill.\\xa0 In their frenzied movements, they were very predictable.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie had been very quiet after that response of mine.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But it was true.\\xa0 It worked on many levels.\\xa0 Force people into darkness, then offer them a light, and they were a moth to a candle flame.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The darkness that surrounded Mothmont wasn\\u2019t <em>my</em> darkness.\\xa0 It was meant to work against me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But it was darkness I could use.\\xa0 The headmistress was worried, and I very much doubted she was sleeping after so many of her students fell ill.\\xa0 Many of them had rich and powerful parents.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been driven into a corner.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Taking a blank piece of paper from the drawer of her desk, I placed it on the top, and I penned out a simple statement with a fountain pen.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;padding-left:30px;\"><em>The Academy would like for you to please order a quarantine.\\xa0 Your students are to be fully examined in the wake of their illnesses, regardless of whether they fell ill.\\xa0 Take care that it includes one and all, and that it is by members of the Academy.\\xa0 </em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;padding-left:30px;\"><em>None of the blame in this lies with you.\\xa0 Provided you speak of this letter to no-one, you have nothing to worry about.\\xa0 All will be well.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Giving the moth her candle flame.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The only way this situation could go sour was if something happened to my group, or if more of the puppeteer\\u2019s Bad Seeds decided to make a break for their families.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The quarantine would keep that from happening and it would force our adversaries into a corner.\\xa0 If there was something they were trying to hide from an autopsy, they might well be uncomfortable with a full physical examination.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The only danger was that she might not listen.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Let it never be said that I couldn\\u2019t have fun.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I opened the fountain pen and took a second to work it out.\\xa0 There was a syringe by the ink bottle.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I <em>hated</em> needles.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But I didn\\u2019t hate them so much that it would stop me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I took a minute to empty the pen with the syringe, and then took another minute to refill the syringe with blood from a thorn-puncture in my palm.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I penned out an illegible signature in blood.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Let her think about <em>that</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I locked the door,then locked all but one of the windows.\\xa0 Removing a shoe to wipe at the drips of water on the floor, retreating while I covered my tracks, I found my way to the remaining window and drew out a bit of thread from my sleeve and cut it with a letter opener, which I pocketed.\\xa0 I carefully looped it around the latch-end, leaving more than enough slack \\u2013 there was a good foot between my hand and the loop that sat around the latch\\u2019s arm.\\xa0 Only tension keeping things from falling to mess and disaster.\\xa0 Pointing up, the latch was unlocked.\\xa0 A simple turn meant it fit into a waiting cradle, and resisted attempts to open the window.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I climbed out of the window, then eased the window shut.\\xa0 Pulling on the thread with the knot, I worked the latch down, until it sat in the cradle.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I pulled on one end of the thread, and worked it out of the gap in the window.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Let her wonder who at the Academy would be leaving her a message signed in blood, in a room with all means of entrance and egress properly locked and sealed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hopefully while she was wondering she wouldn\\u2019t be telling herself she couldn\\u2019t risk the quarantine.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I headed down one floor, sticking myself with a few more thorns on the way.\\xa0 I was thoroughly soaked by the time I reached the set of windows on the ground floor.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The letter opener slid between windows to lift a latch.\\xa0 I let myself into the records room.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The benefits of an organization being as hoity-toity as Mothmont were that they kept good records.\\xa0 I had what I needed in two minutes.\\xa0 Mary Coburn.\\xa0 I tucked it into my waistband behind my back, and pulled my shirt down to cover it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I exited through a window opposite the one I\\u2019d entered, stepping out onto the street beyond Mothmont.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The rain poured down on me and the notecards.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t care.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She had them categorized.\\xa0 Staff was a category.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Of that staff, two thirds were women.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I found myself fumbling through the cards that remained, wishing Jamie were around.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie would know the names of streets better than I did, even in an unfamiliar end of town.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Still, we knew they were close.\\xa0 If these students were paying regular visits, they had to be slipping away in the evenings, or when others were making their special visits to the Academy.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>House</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I placed two cards back in the box when the addresses suggested apartments.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Another card, McCairn\\u2019s, proved to be too far away.\\xa0 Poor bastard probably had to travel a ways every morning and night.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Unless he was staying at the Academy like he had tonight.\\xa0 Either way, I felt confident in ruling him out.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Richards, Harper, Mason, Kelly, Caldwell, Percy, and Blankenship.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I moved at a quick pace through the rain, favoring the parts of the street where the lamp-light didn\\u2019t shine.\\xa0 The only soul who saw me was a large man that was walking a near-empty cart of bodies through the streets, ringing a bell with a low tone.\\xa0 Coin for bodies.\\xa0 The area here was too nice for it to be lucrative, compared to areas closer to the orphanage where people couldn\\u2019t pay their way out of being sick.\\xa0 I guessed he probably only did a walk-around once a month or once every few weeks.\\xa0 Often only at night, because of the reactions the wagons drew in <em>public</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">If our puppeteer wasn\\u2019t entirely alone, there could well be a few adventurous sorts who might do the reverse transaction, lightening the wagon.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I considered for a second, then caught up with him.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was so very <em>human</em> of him to be startled by my sudden, quiet appearance.\\xa0 I thought for a second he might have messed himself, but the smell came from one of the bodies.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He seemed immune to the smell.\\xa0 He wore a heavy rain-cloak that trailed down all the way to his calves, and was thin, with lanky hair suggesting he perhaps didn\\u2019t eat most nights.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Maybe he was doing his rounds here because others had edged him out of another territory.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHas any one person delivered a number of c<em>hildren</em> your way?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cChildren?\\u201d\\xa0 He frowned.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBoys and girls, about my age, or a little younger.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDunno,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I badly wished I had some coins to spare.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThese street names,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I held up cards, pointing.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere are these?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He gave me some quick directions.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAny with big houses?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cMost.\\xa0 Why?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWork with me, I\\u2019ll make it worth your while.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He scoffed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I remained still and silent, hoping that he might come around if I was serious enough.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 At the end of the day, I was only a child, half-drowned in the heavy rain.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOut of my way if you don\\u2019t want to get run over,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I stepped closer, and I stuck the letter opener into his crotch.\\xa0 Not hard enough to pierce anything, but enough to let him know there was a point to it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I didn\\u2019t say or do anything.\\xa0 I remained where I was, a blade held close to a part no man wanted to lose.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I waited, once more, not moving or making a noise, hoping he would come around this time.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My hand went up, holding the soaked cards with their running ink.\\xa0 He caught my wrist, and for a second I thought he had me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I pushed the point a little deeper, and his entire pelvis moved back.\\xa0 I was careful to keep the blade in place.\\xa0 I suspected the point might have hooked on a tag of skin, incentivizing him to stay right where he was.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was a growl to his voice as he said, \\u201cTrellis is closest further down that way.\\xa0 Then Yarrow, a little to the right, then in same direction, then Olds which is a hard right.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll see the other two streets if you stick to Olds.\\xa0 Biggest houses on Yarrow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded, \\u201cLet go of me, now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He did.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I twisted away, withdrawing my letter opener, and splashed off into the rain.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Trellis was dark.\\xa0 The buildings looked more like apartments than anything else.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Yarrow was where I found my prize.\\xa0 Mr. Percy\\u2019s residence.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The lights weren\\u2019t on, but there was a candle flame on the second floor, and as ever, the branches were inviting in how they offered me places for my hands and feet.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I got as close as I could to the window where I\\u2019d spied the candle flame, where it rose from a steeply sloping roof, and I listened.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201c\\u2026the boys!?\\u201d Mary\\u2019s voice rose at the end, a question.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>There we go</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">And she was using the words I\\u2019d given her, using <em>my</em> labels.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I sat back and listened.</p>\\n<p><a

this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m <em>scared</em>!\\xa0 I\\u2019ve never been scared!\\xa0 And you\\u2019re not answering my questions, which-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-isn\\u2019t making me feel any better!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shifted positions and settled back, now that I knew I was close enough to hear, the box of notecards in my lap, the contents thoroughly soaked.\\xa0 The words were muffled by the intervening wall and window, but I could make them out and differentiate the speakers.\\xa0 The man, who I was assuming was Percy, was speaking in a very careful, measured tone.</p>\\n<p>Mary was displaying more emotion in a given <em>word</em> than I\\u2019d seen from her during my entire discussion with her.</p>\\n<p>The rain streamed over me, and I pushed my hair straight back, away from my face, glad that it was so very wet that it didn\\u2019t just spring back into the most inconvenient position.\\xa0 I was soaked through, and imagined that the spot at my back where the file was tucked into my waistband was so wet that the print from the pages was staining my skin.</p>\\n<p>It wouldn\\u2019t, but I still imagined it.</p>\\n<p>Where my skin was new on my arms and various points on my body, I could feel the cold of the rain like rough circles of ice.\\xa0 The passage of a single droplet left an ache singing through my nerves for seconds after it was gone.</p>\\n<p>I shifted over, so the section of the room that jutted out to frame the window was tight against one of my arms and the slight overhang of shingles provided a bit of shelter.\\xa0 It helped.</p>\\n<p>The puppeteer spoke, \\u201cMary.\\xa0 I told you to be ready for anything, that the Academy was almost guaranteed to respond.\\xa0 You did very well to discover them as early and accurately as you did.\\xa0 I\\u2019m proud of you for accomplishing that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t anything special.\\xa0 A group of kids shows up all at once?\\xa0 Just had to keep an eye on them.\\xa0 The boys-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe boys,\\u201d he said, and he gave the word a different tone in the process.\\xa0 He was apparently noting the phrasing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey did most of the work there, finding the group from the Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m still proud of you, Mary,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 There was a pause, uncomfortable and long.\\xa0 I had to fight the urge to peek in the window.\\xa0 The puppeteer resumed, his voice low and soothing, as if talking to an infant \\u201cDeep breath now.\\xa0 In\\u2026 and out.\\xa0 There we go.\\xa0 Tears wiped away, hair fixed up, and you\\u2019re not so flustered.\\xa0 Do you feel a little better?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA little.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe knew they would send someone or <em>something</em>.\\xa0 I warned you to be prepared for anything.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought it would be\\u2026 one of those tools you hear the Academy talking about.\\xa0 The Dog and Catcher, or the man with the hands.\\xa0 Something like that.\\xa0 I was expecting to have to deal with <em>monsters</em>, I didn\\u2019t\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou didn\\u2019t\\u2026?\\u201d the puppeteer asked, trailing off much as Mary had.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t prepared for them to be like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyebrows were already up.</p>\\n<p>The Dog and Catcher were well known enough as they could be seen around town, but I was surprised that \\u2018the man with the hands\\u2019 had come up.\\xa0 That would be the Hangman file from the Academy, and that file was pretty damn confidential.\\xa0 Enough so that even <em>I</em> hadn\\u2019t known about it until I\\u2019d started to wonder what special project the Tackhouse had put together and went out of my way to get the file.</p>\\n<p>Had the little clones here been similarly busy during Mothmont\\u2019s excursions to the Academy?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re very much alive, Mary, which you might well not be if it was another individual or group from the Academy.\\xa0 I\\u2019m quite grateful for that fact.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know how to move forward, and I don\\u2019t like standing still when I\\u2019m not sure where I stand.\\xa0 The boys-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour <em>brothers </em>are your brothers, nothing else.\\xa0 You were born from the same womb.\\xa0 Have I spent half as much time in their company as I have in yours?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look like you still have doubts,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m okay,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout the children from the Academy-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t change the subject.\\xa0 Do you have doubts, Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTry to voice them.\\xa0 I\\u2019d like a chance to answer them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI feel as though, if I had to guess, you might have told them that <em>they</em> were special, and you only spend time with me because I need the extra practice and training.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, Mary.\\xa0 No, no no,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 I could hear the huff of a heavy sigh.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m so caught off guard by the idea that I don\\u2019t even know what to say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI knew it was unfair,\\u201d Mary said, and her voice was so quiet I could barely hear it.\\xa0 \\u201cThere isn\\u2019t a right answer, nothing you could say that would make me feel better.\\xa0 So I wasn\\u2019t going to say anything.\\xa0 It\\u2019s poison they put into my head, and I don\\u2019t want the poison to bleed out into this.\\xa0 Us, our family, our home.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me.\\xa0 Share your worries when they come up.\\xa0 I know that what we\\u2019re doing here is a lonely exercise.\\xa0 I rely on you and your brothers to be my hands, while I continue to refine my work.\\xa0 I hope you can rely on me in the same way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her reply was so soft I couldn\\u2019t hear it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I like to hear.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do we do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour brothers are in the dark?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe fix that, first.\\xa0 I\\u2019m glad you came to me, but as special as you are to me, I do care about your brothers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t do anything about this unknown member of the group.\\xa0 From your description, I imagine she\\u2019s better suited against specific threats that are vulnerable to a chemical or counteragent.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought about that.\\xa0 She can\\u2019t do anything without communication, either.\\xa0 The members of the Academy children have to give her information to work with, if she\\u2019s going to do anything to find us.\\xa0 If we wait and watch, they\\u2019ll eventually lead us to her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wanted to laugh.\\xa0 The irony.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe boy, Gordon, he was a physical threat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know if you could call him that.\\xa0 He\\u2019s stronger than he looks.\\xa0 He shoved his way through a locked door.\\xa0 Sylvester, the one I talked to, he said Gordon was the one to watch out for.\\xa0 Described him as being a jack of trades, or something like that.\\xa0 Physical prowess.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe one to watch out for.\\xa0 Do you believe him?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Not completely.\\xa0 But he said Gordon would come for you, if they identified you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey will, and he will, I think,\\u201d the puppeteer said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNor do I.\\xa0 But I don\\u2019t see any way around it.\\xa0 This is how the Academy operates, and just as we can\\u2019t cry over the rain, which we cannot change, we cannot cry about the Academy being what it is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like the rain,\\u201d Mary said, and her voice was a hair louder than it had been.</p>\\n<p>I was sitting beside the window, to the point where I was looking across it rather than <em>into </em>it, but the square of orange where the glass had caught the light from within changed as Mary\\u2019s head and upper body blocked some of it.</p>\\n<p>She was only two feet from me, and she didn\\u2019t even know it.</p>\\n<p>I shifted one hand to cover the spot on my arm where it was sensitive, the cold almost unbearable.\\xa0 Unfortunately, the backs of my hands had suffered as much as anything, and the cold rain touched them just as sharply.</p>\\n<p>The light shifted again.\\xa0 The puppeteer had drawn closer to the window as well.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA moment ago you said you were afraid.\\xa0 For the first time?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFear is rooted in the unknown.\\xa0 I think that is why great minds tend to find such an unreasonable confidence in the process of plumbing it.\\xa0 They face the unknown, they conquer it, and they diminish it until it no longer holds sway over them, and they continue to charge onward.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen you say great minds, do you include yourself?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would,\\u201d Mary retorted, without hesitation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re biased.\\xa0 Someone could say I\\u2019m clever, and I might agree with them, but I wouldn\\u2019t say I\\u2019m great.\\xa0 We\\u2019re getting sidetracked.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t planning on sharing this with you.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not because I was hiding anything, but because I didn\\u2019t see the need.\\xa0 But if it helps you forge through the unknown, there\\u2019s a need.\\xa0 I may not know who they are, but I know what they are.\\xa0 Or is it the other way around?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy children?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 More than a decade ago, I was involved with the Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInvolved?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe system and structure were different.\\xa0 For a time, the amount of space outpaced the glut of students.\\xa0 They opened the doors and let some in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou?\\xa0 Really?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was one such individual.\\xa0 Not a true student.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t pay a tuition, and I didn\\u2019t ever harbor delusions of being a graduate, a teacher or a professor.\\xa0 They left us scraps, told us that when classes weren\\u2019t full we could fight between ourselves to take the additional spots.\\xa0 We could use the libraries, and we had to put in a certain number of hours in service to the Academy.\\xa0 Each and every one of us knew that if a paying student walked in the door, one of us would be leaving in that same heartbeat.\\xa0 Those of us who endured it did so because we were <em>hungry</em> for it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy were we hungry, or why did we do it?\\u201d the puppeteer asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy did you do it?\\xa0 How could you stand being second class citizens?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Does that rub you the wrong way?\\xa0 Do you think that if people knew what you were, that they would put you a rung lower than any \\u2018true\\u2019 human?\\xa0 Think you derivative?\\xa0 A curio?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were told that we were training to be assistants.\\xa0 To know our way around the labs and the books and to know what needed stirring and how often, or to be effective sounding boards for the <em>real</em> great minds, when they were talking their way through a problem.\\xa0 Every seat we were able to claim for ourselves was another dollar we were worth.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s weird, hearing you talk about the Academy like this.\\xa0 You <em>hate</em> them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do.\\xa0 That doesn\\u2019t mean I don\\u2019t value the knowledge or the education.\\xa0 I got my position at Mothmont.\\xa0 Everything they promised came true.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut we\\u2019re getting off topic,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not what I was asking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m giving you a different answer to a different question.\\xa0 Listen, I managed to barter my way into a seat for a class, I think it was called \\u2018The Applied Mind\\u2019.\\xa0 We were given projects.\\xa0 Brainstorming, application.\\xa0 Students had to work in groups, and I was paired with another non-student student.\\xa0 He lost his position in the school, leaving me entirely on my own.\\xa0 My project was amateurish, more concept than anything close to a proper execution.\\xa0 But I got to sit through the entire class and I got glimpses of the work others did.\\xa0 They kept it quiet, but they couldn\\u2019t completely silence twenty-five students out of a class of sixty.\\xa0 The timing made too much sense, with the first appearance of certain special projects.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re talking about the Academy children?\\xa0 They\\u2019re the work the other groups did?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, I think so.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve already told me some of it.\\xa0 I moved on to another year of classes, and I heard through word of mouth that the project had fallen through, not enough viable results.\\xa0 Died in the womb.\\xa0 I saw how despondent some of the students were, and I believed it.\\xa0 I heard the department was getting cut back a great deal, and I believed that too.\\xa0 I still do.\\xa0 I paid attention for two more months, and then my seat was taken.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re not just a <em>special</em> project, but a secret one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne of several.\\xa0 But, based on everything you\\u2019ve shared with me, those details I could process in the rare moments you stopped for breath, I remain suspicious these Academy children are a <em>failed</em> project.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFailed?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly a suspicion.\\xa0 The funding is spent, the department was cut back, but several of the projects lived, and it costs relatively little to keep an ongoing project operating.\\xa0 Perhaps other failures were given a second chance because it was inexpensive.\\xa0 It would explain the group being larger than it should.\\xa0 Thus, we would have a failed project maintained as long as there is spare change to keep it going, made use of whenever an appropriate situation comes up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe said something about being injured, and it was recent.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019re the first job they\\u2019ve done lately.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t mean it isn\\u2019t a niche project,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s true.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was there for the conception, the brainstorming, and the discussions.\\xa0 All I took away was that it wasn\\u2019t a roaring success, and a great many people were disappointed.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think I retained anything else that\\u2019s noteworthy\\u2026 well, one thing, of course.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne thing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou, Mary.\\xa0 Your brothers.\\xa0 You were my project.\\xa0 The seed of the idea was born then.\\xa0 It sat with me for a few years, until I had the means to make it happen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary was silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were a gamble.\\xa0 You still are, but back then, I remember losing sleep.\\xa0 I tried to put two projects forward, but I only had so much time to dedicate to the task.\\xa0 I had to make a decision.\\xa0 Would I follow the instructions to the letter with an inferior idea, or would I present <em>you, </em>knowing that you were novel as an approach, but doomed to be dismissed for not fitting to the rules?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe said- Sylvester said that the Academy prizes innovation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 He\\u2019s right, and that idea is probably why I decided to do what I did.\\xa0 I thought a great deal about what happened back then.\\xa0 What I\\u2019d do differently, given a second chance.\\xa0 Then I decided to see it through, and I did it on my own, which is something they can never forgive me for.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause they want <em>control</em>,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 As much as they prize innovation, they prize control more.\\xa0 A mind that runs away with ideas is cherished there, so long as it remains <em>there</em>.\\xa0 Within or <em>with</em> the Academy.\\xa0 Here?\\xa0 Past arm\\u2019s length?\\xa0 Not something cherished, but despised.\\xa0 <em>That\\u2019s</em> our enemy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA little less of an unknown,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Now you know why they\\u2019re doing what they\\u2019re doing.\\xa0 You have a sense of who they are.\\xa0 A failed venture.\\xa0 Does that take some of the fear away?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour hand,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 There was a pause.\\xa0 \\u201cLook at that, it\\u2019s as steady as a rock.\\xa0 Arm yourself, conceal the weapons, but bring enough to arm your brothers.\\xa0 I\\u2019m going to the school, and you\\u2019re coming with me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to the school?\\u201d she asked, and she sounded anything <em>but</em> calm.\\xa0 I heard sounds as she followed the instructions, all the same.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere do you think I should go?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnywhere <em>but</em> the school.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t think they\\u2019ll find me?\\xa0 Or that they might have sent other resources after us?\\xa0 I\\u2019m safest in <em>your</em> company, in the cover of the crowd, or where I can use my power as a member of the school faculty.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll have all three of those things at the school for as long as I\\u2019m there, which won\\u2019t be for long.\\xa0 You can\\u2019t communicate with your brothers for as long as the Academy children know your face.\\xa0 Leave that much to me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t like it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI suppose you wouldn\\u2019t.\\xa0 You were always my most careful one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going ahead with this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t see any other way to do it.\\xa0 Trust me, Mary.\\xa0 I gave you a <em>wealth</em> of talents, but I\\u2019m not without my own.\\xa0 This is something I can manage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want you to get hurt.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not as afraid for <em>me</em>, but my fear for you is enough that I can barely think straight!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease.\\xa0 You made me, you raised me, I\\u2019ve never refused to obey.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve done everything you asked.\\xa0 Let me have a say just <em>once</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou would have me abandon your brothers?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said they weren\\u2019t that viable.\\xa0 They know what they have to do.\\xa0 If they make it, they\\u2019ll fulfill their mission.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s go.\\xa0 Leave, take the notes, drain the tanks, burn the house to erase the evidence.\\xa0 The Academy won\\u2019t catch up to us if we\\u2019re quick about it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t do that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said it was about me and you.\\xa0 That I\\u2019d be by your side as the elder sister to all the viables.\\xa0 Do this for me, <em>prove it</em>.\\xa0 Prove <em>that</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I sacrificed your brothers to save my own skin, you would always suspect that I would do the same to you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 I wouldn\\u2019t, I promise.\\xa0 Please, don\\u2019t make what <em>he</em> said true.\\xa0 Prove that <em>you\\u2019re</em> right.\\xa0 Prove it!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProve it!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a frantic edge to the words, now.</p>\\n<p>In stark contrast, the puppeteer\\u2019s voice was low and drawn out, voicing multiple syllables I couldn\\u2019t put together into a word.\\xa0 A nonsense utterance with a cadence to it.</p>\\n<p>Mary had fallen silent.</p>\\n<p><em>An imprinted phrase</em>?\\xa0 Planned, crafted as something that wouldn\\u2019t be repeated in everyday conversation.</p>\\n<p>I heard noise, but from the heavy footsteps and creaks, I took it to be him and him alone.\\xa0 Papers rustling, a thud, steps disappearing into another room, very possibly downstairs.</p>\\n<p>Almost a minute passed before his return.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTake it,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cDrink.\\xa0 Keep drinking\\u2026 there.\\xa0 You\\u2019re dehydrated and tired.\\xa0 It\\u2019s been a long night.\\xa0 Finish collecting the weapons and tools, we\\u2019re leaving as soon as I have my coat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI-\\u201d Mary started.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Far more hesitant than she\\u2019d been a minute and a half ago.</p>\\n<p>What exactly had happened?</p>\\n<p>And was it something I could use?</p>\\n<p>I shifted my position, grabbing the rain-slick windowsill and leaning out and over, to glimpse the front face of the large house, locating the front door.</p>\\n<p>I slid as much as I crawled, dragging myself across the rooftop, beneath the window\\u2019s field of view, to get to the other side, and it was even more awkward a process with the box of notecards still occupying one of my hands.</p>\\n<p>My uniform was <em>filthy, </em>and it wasn\\u2019t just muck and dirt, but with the crawl over the shingles it was a muck and dirt that had been driven into the fabric.\\xa0 I took care finding Percy\\u2019s notecard in the dark, then tucked it into a pants pocket.\\xa0 The rest of the notecards I clamped between my teeth.</p>\\n<p>I waited, listening as the puppeteer resumed speaking.\\xa0 \\u201cI need you to focus.\\xa0 It\\u2019s been a long night, but my well being and your well being depend on your ability to watch our backs.\\xa0 Remind me why you\\u2019re my best work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said, and the word was warm with pride at the same time it was just a little faint.\\xa0 Whatever he\\u2019d done to her, she was still reeling from it.</p>\\n<p>I made sure my position was secure, then snapped off the end of a shingle, where rain and weather had worn it down to the point where it was soft, hanging over the gutter.</p>\\n<p>I did the same for the next length of shingle, though it required a little more work.</p>\\n<p>Each piece was as thick as eight or so pieces of paper put together, two fingers\\u2019 width wide, and of varying lengths, all gritty like sandpaper.</p>\\n<p>Each piece of shingle went into the box.</p>\\n<p>I scooted along further, pausing now and again to listen, hearing nothing.\\xa0 More shingles went into the box, but it wasn\\u2019t much larger than a brick, and I soon reached the point where the shingles were being wedged in rather than dropped in.</p>\\n<p>It was true I wasn\\u2019t good in a fight, but that didn\\u2019t mean I didn\\u2019t occasionally have my moments.</p>\\n<p>The trick was to avoid making it a proper <em>fight</em>, per se.</p>\\n<p>I rolled my shoulders, and found they were still stiff.\\xa0 My arms were cold.</p>\\n<p>The door opened below me, and in my eagerness to react, I very nearly launched myself forward, over the gutter, and two stories down to the ground.</p>\\n<p>I hefted the weight of the box that had held the notecards.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t so heavy.\\xa0 Five, six pounds.\\xa0 A little larger than a brick, and about as heavy.</p>\\n<p>While Mary was reeling from whatever the puppeteer had done to her, she might be slower to react.\\xa0 I had to gauge my options, trust my ability, see them step away from the door after the puppeteer had locked it.</p>\\n<p>I got my first glimpse of the man.\\xa0 Tall, hair slicked back from a widow\\u2019s peak, casually forming what looked like two horns, pointing at some area behind the back of his head.\\xa0 Streaks of grey reached back from his temples.\\xa0 His mustache-less facial hair swept forward much as his hair swept <em>back</em>, the point of the beard extending the chin of an already long face.\\xa0 His jacket was long and clung to his body, adding to his apparent height and very lean build.\\xa0 It was in the style of a lab coat without actually being a lab coat, very fashionable, and black.\\xa0 It said as much about the man as anything else.</p>\\n<p>All put together, he was <em>meticulous</em>.\\xa0 It was the first and last word that sprung to mind.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d heard his confidence as he talked about how he\\u2019d fend for himself at the school.\\xa0 I knew how hard it might be to get to him, or to catch up to him once he tapped the available resources and made his escape to some other town.</p>\\n<p>Mary hadn\\u2019t quite believed him when he\\u2019d said he would be okay.</p>\\n<p>I did.</p>\\n<p>Which was why I brought the box back, and smashed the window with it.</p>\\n<p>I saw him stop, turning.\\xa0 Mary turned too, but it was a slow reaction.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d seen Gordon in a good fight.\\xa0 There were moments where I\\u2019d seen him throw a punch as his opponent turned their head, so it made the hit worse.\\xa0 The opposite of rolling with the punches.\\xa0 I\\u2019d fallen in love with the image and tried to emulate it in a fistfight and been kicked in the ribs several times over for my trouble.</p>\\n<p>In this case, it was pure accident, but he made it happen.\\xa0 His head turned to look up at me, and the brick-ish box of shingles had already left my hand.\\xa0 He brought his face straight into it.</p>\\n<p>I saw spatters of darkness that might have been blood, and I saw his ass hit the wet footpath leading between the door and the road.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to crow my victory to the night sky, to laugh at the success my ribs had suffered for just months ago, but that might have ruined the effect.</p>\\n<p>Better to stay a small, dark, dirty, drenched shape on the roof, and see if I could re-awaken little Mary\\u2019s fear all over again.\\xa0 Fear of me, and fear for her puppeteer\\u2019s safety.</p>\\n<p>I saw her crouch, caught between keeping an eye on me and helping the puppeteer.</p>\\n<p>She had weapons, I knew.\\xa0 She could throw a hatchet, and knives weren\\u2019t out of the question.</p>\\n<p>In a throwing contest, she was liable to win.</p>\\n<p>I had to turn up the pressure.\\xa0 The moment this became a contest of skill or strength, she would win.</p>\\n<p>I reached into the broken window, disappointed that the lights were off, and felt inside until I found a wine bottle with only a few gulps left in it.\\xa0 I hucked it at them.</p>\\n<p>Mary put herself between Percy and the bottle, hunching over so it smashed against her shoulder.\\xa0 The top end disappeared into the grass at the boundary of the property.</p>\\n<p>The irony being that if she hadn\\u2019t put herself in the way, the course would have led to me missing entirely.</p>\\n<p>I found a book and threw <em>that</em>, but it opened in mid-air, drifting off course.\\xa0 It landed a few feet to their left, my right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll kill you,\\u201d she said, her voice carrying over the patter of the rain.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTry it,\\u201d I said, blindly fumbling for the next thing I might be able to throw.\\xa0 \\u201cCome after me.\\xa0 We can play hide and seek, and the moment you lose track of me, it\\u2019ll be because I\\u2019m busy slitting his throat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I held up the letter opener.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t need to know that it wasn\\u2019t particularly sharp.\\xa0 She just needed to know that I was armed.</p>\\n<p>But the gesture was a mistake, because it gave her a window to act, where she didn\\u2019t need to shield the puppeteer.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t even see her palm the knife, and her entire body moved with the throwing motion.</p>\\n<p>Not <em>entirely</em> surprised, I swung lazily to one side, holding on to the top of the window frame, moving over to the other side.</p>\\n<p>She was already readying to throw again.\\xa0 Two knives at once?</p>\\n<p>I swung again, hoping to irritate her into making a mistake.\\xa0 I badly underestimated how good she was.\\xa0 The first knife hit the window frame a quarter-foot in front of my face.\\xa0 A slightly faster swing, and it would have hit me.</p>\\n<p>The second knife\\u2026 I didn\\u2019t feel or hear it land, and the lack of sensory awareness fed straight into that \\u2018prey instinct\\u2019 that Jamie and I had discussed.</p>\\n<p>A sense that something was wrong.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d <em>pretended</em> to throw two at once, but had held back the other.\\xa0 Before I\\u2019d fully processed the fact that I\\u2019d almost swung right <em>into</em> the knife\\u2019s path, she was throwing it in a simple clean, crisp motion.\\xa0 No choreographing, no putting her entire body into the throw.\\xa0 The sort of thing I could very nearly miss if I wasn\\u2019t paying enough attention.</p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019s aiming for-</em></p>\\n<p>The half formed thought was enough to make me let go of the window frame, falling and sliding until both of my feet landed in the gutter, the back of my head banging against the windowsill.</p>\\n<p>The knife buried itself into the spot where my hand had been.\\xa0 While I\\u2019d been moving from side to side, my hand had been staying in place, keeping me from falling.</p>\\n<p>This time I was paying attention to what her hands were doing.\\xa0 They traced the bottom of her uniform top and the fingers curled inward, holding what was presumably another throwing knife.</p>\\n<p>I grinned at her.\\xa0 \\u201cI saw that.\\xa0 Not quite subtle enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t waste them,\\u201d the puppeteer said, raising one hand to the side of his face, then removing it, revealing a mess of blood on the fingers.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s baiting you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s a bastard,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI never pretended to be anything but,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I reached up for a grip on the windowsill, and found a large piece of glass.\\xa0 I whipped it at her.</p>\\n<p>She blocked it much as she had the bottle, flinching as it broke.\\xa0 One of the eyes she\\u2019d closed remained closed after she lowered her arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo, we gain nothing by staying.\\xa0 I can walk,\\u201d I heard the puppeteer say.\\xa0 He rose, and Mary was quick to put her entire body under one of his arms, helping him to stand and put a few more steps worth of distance between us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat about the lab?\\u201d Mary said, looking up at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s as good as gone,\\u201d the puppeteer said, mumbling some of the sounds.\\xa0 The hit to his face seemed to have caught his cheekbone and nose, but that was somehow impacting his speech, too.\\xa0 The skin was badly split, and it looked ragged enough that a shingle\\u2019s edge might have caught it.\\xa0 An impact and a sawtooth edge.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d got him good, it seemed.</p>\\n<p>That wasn\\u2019t the sort of thing that made me want to shout my glee to the heavens.\\xa0 The satisfaction was colder, quieter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have all your work,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have enough to start over.\\xa0 If he wants to destroy it, he can destroy it.\\xa0 Survival is paramount, and that includes <em>yours, </em>Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hearing him, I almost believed it, and I would have if I hadn\\u2019t heard his special word and noted the aftermath.</p>\\n<p>I pulled another piece of glass free of the window itself, where it was only hanging on because of the paint.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t strong enough to give it proper distance without putting so much into the throw that I\\u2019d lose all accuracy.\\xa0 They were too far back, standing on the street now.\\xa0 Mary and her hobbling puppeteer.</p>\\n<p>She was glaring at me through one eye, the other staying shut.</p>\\n<p>They turned, Mary watching me out of the corner of her eye, supporting the puppeteer as they retreated in the general direction of the school.</p>\\n<p>I counted the seconds between each over-the-shoulder glance she gave me.</p>\\n<p><em>One, two, three\\u2026

breath, a long stare back in my direction</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>One, two, three, four, glance.</em></p>\\n<p>The moment she turned away, I moved.\\xa0 To one side, to break line of sight, putting the corner of a building between us, then down the face of the building.\\xa0 It was a reckless, haphazard descent, one where I fell more than I descended, stopping myself now and again with a grab at a window shutter or a bit of branch.</p>\\n<p>Providing the moths a flame to follow was one thing.\\xa0 Creating a desire and filling it, destroying the prey at the conclusion.</p>\\n<p>It was another to leave your enemy only one path, and follow them along it.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t strong.\\xa0 I might never be.\\xa0 Gordon could have brained the man with the shingle box.\\xa0 Hell, even Helen could\\u2019ve.\\xa0 Jamie could have done more damage, but probably would never have hit.\\xa0 I\\u2019d hurt the puppeteer, at the very least.\\xa0 Mankind had a long and involved history of being hunters, following a wounded beast for miles.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d already been intent on getting to Mothmont and gathering the <em>boys, </em>his three other killers.\\xa0 Now it was the only place nearby that he had access to where he could tend to his injured face.</p>\\n<p>Nine in ten chance he would do that.\\xa0 One in ten chance that the blow to his head would leave him relying on Mary.</p>\\n<p>It meant I didn\\u2019t need to <em>follow</em>, exactly.\\xa0 That carried its own risks, when little Mary was so very good at throwing things at people.\\xa0 Better to lag behind, to watch my flanks and move with appropriate care and caution.</p>\\n<p>If I happened to catch up with them, there was nothing I could do to capitalize on the situation.\\xa0 If I stayed back, out of sight, then she had to wonder, and that <em>wondering</em> was a very useful tool.\\xa0 It made every decision she made more difficult, with more variables to consider.\\xa0 Every step of the way, she had to watch her back.</p>\\n<p>Approaching the school, I found my way to the same alcove where the coach had stopped to drop me off, and peered around the corner.</p>\\n<p>The puppeteer was alone, his keys rattling as he stood at the locked gate.</p>\\n<p>I immediately whirled around, looking, searching.</p>\\n<p>No Mary in sight.</p>\\n<p><em>You want to play that game, Mary?</em>\\xa0 I thought.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d really hoped that her bond to her creator would mean she stayed close to him, even as he got to the school.\\xa0 But she was sticking to the plan.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t go for the man without risking that Mary would step out and kill me, much as she\\u2019d promised back at Percy\\u2019s home.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d angered her enough that she was going to kill me very, very thoroughly, if she got the chance.</p>\\n<p>I could go straight for the puppeteer, but that was a gamble.\\xa0 Was Mary close?\\xa0 Hiding?\\xa0 Would she intercept me?\\xa0 She had a couple of inches on me in height, she had been trained, <em>honed</em>, and I wasn\\u2019t positive I could outrun her if it came down to it.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t like that gamble.</p>\\n<p>The man was still working to find the right key when the gate opened.</p>\\n<p>It was the headmistress.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMister Percy!\\u201d she exclaimed.\\xa0 I looked through the window and thought it was a vagrant.\\xa0 What happened!?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was feeling better,\\u201d he said, mumbling.\\xa0 He coughed and spat, \\u201cThought I\\u2019d check how things were.\\xa0 A thug on the street waylaid me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood mercy.\\xa0 Get yourself inside.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll get you patched up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I heard the gate shut and click.\\xa0 That was my mark to go, double checking for a murderous Mary, then heading to the same window I\\u2019d used to exit the building, slipping inside.</p>\\n<p>My shoes had hard soles.\\xa0 I slipped them off.\\xa0 Comfort was secondary to moving quietly.</p>\\n<p>If I could get past Mary to reach Percy, I won.\\xa0 If Mary could get to any of us, possibly excepting Gordon or <em>very possibly</em> Helen, it was over.\\xa0 We\\u2019d never get the advantage over them with one of ours down and out.\\xa0 If she could reach her group, they\\u2019d have an overwhelming advantage.\\xa0 If I could reach mine\\u2026 well, we\\u2019d be a group, and I could share what I knew.\\xa0 In a situation as tenuous as this, their combined strength beat out ours.</p>\\n<p>Lopsided, as games went.\\xa0 Her with her arsenal of knives and whatever else, me with my letter opener and the knowledge that she was <em>scared, </em>though she was only willing to show it to her maker.</p>\\n<p>Who, as he\\u2019d endeavored to communicate to her, wasn\\u2019t to be discounted as a player of our dark little game.</p>\\n<p>I smiled to myself as I darted off into the recesses of the building.</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/03/21/taking-root-1-5/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>Our conversation had to stop for a moment when a group of boys veered our way, kicking a ball between them.\\xa0 They circled the tree that was holding up one corner of the glass roof, then headed off toward their makeshift goals.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe lunch hour is going to end before too long,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe should hammer out details.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy\\u2019s idea, making sure we\\u2019re all on the same page\\u2026\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay, that makes sense.\\xa0 Sy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHold on.\\xa0 I can change details based on where you guys are at.\\xa0 Fill me in, quick.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 As far as everyone here knows, including the headmistress and the rest of the faculty, I\\u2019m the son of a butcher mogul, Helen is the daughter of a diplomat, and Jamie is the orphan son of a military captain who died and left him some money.\\xa0 At Jamie\\u2019s suggestion, the story is that we were all staying at the orphanage as a matter of convenience before our enrollment at Mothmont.\\xa0 Favors were called in, whatever.\\xa0 It\\u2019s happened before, given the ties between Lambsbridge and Radham Academy, and it\\u2019s not going to surprise anyone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been here before,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cBefore I was a student at the Academy.\\xa0 Teachers know me, they like me.\\xa0 We leaked the idea that I was suspended, and the rules of Mothmont mean I can come back here whenever, to get some classes in, use facilities or brush up.\\xa0 I might have to explain to my parents, but I think it\\u2019s okay.\\xa0 Nobody\\u2019s asked how I know you guys, but I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a problem.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI suggested the \\u2018ties to the orphanage\\u2019 thing because I recognized faces among the students, and those faces have probably seen us out and about as a group,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOverall, we have a cover,\\u201d Gordon elaborated, \\u201cNothing so questionable that anyone\\u2019s going to raise questions.\\xa0 But people have a way of taking things at face value, and this situation hasn\\u2019t really bucked the trend.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept for the attempts on your life,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept for that.\\xa0 But there aren\\u2019t any holes in what we\\u2019re saying that should have raised suspicions,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cMr. Hayle filled me in on most of that, but it\\u2019s good to have the details.\\xa0 He said he was intentionally vague about who I was, so I could adapt as the situation required.\\xa0 He <em>did</em> say that it was a special favor from the orphanage to work me in later than the rest of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReally,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He smiled a little, \\u201cWhy would the orphanage be so eager to get rid of you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause I\\u2019m intolerable,\\u201d I replied, smiling back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGoing by the fact that we\\u2019ve been seen together, and we\\u2019re being seen together\\xa0<em>now</em>, who <em>are</em> you, and how do we know you?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>I shrugged, and I was reminded of just how uncomfortable the uniform was, and the spots where it was rubbing against the new skin.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m an orphan.\\xa0 We were about the same age, I offered to show you around town.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat won\\u2019t go over well,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m betting it won\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cScrubby kid with messy hair from wrong side of the tracks.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll stick out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich is your plan,\\u201d Gordon concluded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn part.\\xa0 But before that\\u2026 what have you done so far?\\xa0 What angles have been covered?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, you know me,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s only been a week and I\\u2019m almost the best student in my class, best at sports, and most can\\u2019t even bring themselves to hate me for it.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been mingling with the top dogs among the boys here.\\xa0 Helen\\u2019s done the same for the girls.\\xa0 Between the two of us, we\\u2019ve been able to get the word on who the victims were, as well as keep an eye out for who the potential victims might be.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnything conclusive?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLess than I\\u2019d like.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve asked for extra help to get up to speed with our classes, and that\\u2019s let us keep an ear to the ground when it comes to the faculty.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a chance that the person turning children into murder weapons is one of the teachers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly a chance?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEvery weekend, students go to the Academy.\\xa0 Get a taste of it, keeps them invested in Mothmont.\\xa0 Split up into groups based on interest and age.\\xa0 Students who were extra good get special lessons with professors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s\\u2026 messy,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cToo many things to cover.\\xa0 You didn\\u2019t visit me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was recovering from being poisoned,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian was hovering, making sure nobody had reason to get too curious about me.\\xa0 That left only Helen and Jamie, and they were busy following up on likelies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoison, huh?\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t expecting that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was the most successful attempt out of the three, two for me, one for Jamie.\\xa0 One object fell from the roof, almost caving Helen\\u2019s head in, and Jamie very nearly got pushed in front of a fast moving coach while he was on his way to the Academy.\\xa0 Helen saved him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.\\xa0 \\u201cNo sightings?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re careful.\\xa0 And they\\u2019re a <em>they</em>, we\\u2019re pretty sure.\\xa0 Plural.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cStarting to get a more complete mental picture.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes glanced over the collection of youths around us.\\xa0 Would there be overt signs?\\xa0 They couldn\\u2019t be too obvious, or the others would have noticed.</p>\\n<p>Without knowing more about how the murders were being done, I didn\\u2019t know what to look for.\\xa0 We were surrounded, and letting our guard down could be dangerous.</p>\\n<p>Jamie, maybe thinking I was still hurt that they hadn\\u2019t come for me, commented, \\u201cI looked for you at the Tower, poked my head into Hayle\\u2019s department, to check the labs to see if you were around, and because I wanted to ask a quick question about Gordon and the poison.\\xa0 I got word on where you were, but I didn\\u2019t have much time to look around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hm.\\xa0 I probably would have been where Jamie looked for me if I hadn\\u2019t barred myself in the office after my appointment.\\xa0 Live and learn.</p>\\n<p>The Tower, Mr. Hayle\\u2019s department opposite end of the Academy campus from the Hedge where I\\u2019d been, was largely focused on research and development regarding the <em>brain</em>.\\xa0 Widely viewed as a dead end, the department had defaulted to handling a lot of information storage, memory banks, and files.</p>\\n<p>If Jamie had been there\\u2026 I spoke my thoughts aloud, \\u201cJamie went to the Tower because\\u2026 you guys were thinking about mind control?\\xa0 Something to do with the brain?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were thinking it could be some neurological manipulation,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen was looking into hormones and drugs at Claret Hall.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Claret Hall being the center of campus, where students gathered and ate, where key administration facilities were available, and where some of the key elements of the campus and core classes were taught.\\xa0 If all aspects of Radham flowed from the Academy, then all aspects of the Academy flowed from Claret Hall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you didn\\u2019t find anything,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you had, you would have told me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing meaningful,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s head turned.\\xa0 I followed his gaze.\\xa0 Students were still playing, gathering in groups, but his focus wasn\\u2019t on the students.\\xa0 \\u201cMore teachers appearing around the doors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrouble?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn a way.\\xa0 We\\u2019re out of time.\\xa0 Lunch is over.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re going to fill us in, now\\u2019s the time to do it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re close enough to the door that people will see us,\\u201d I observed.\\xa0 \\u201cEveryone but Helen, keep an eye on the crowd.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t be obvious about it, but keep an eye out for hints.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat am <em>I</em> doing?\\u201d\\xa0 Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>A shrill whistle drew the attention of the various students.\\xa0 It sounded again.\\xa0 A teacher was signaling for others to come indoors.\\xa0 Hordes of students began moving toward the doors.\\xa0 Some lingered, like we were, and some were quickly wrapping up their games.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFix my hair,\\u201d I instructed Helen, \\u201cGive me a kiss on the cheek or something, be tender about it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like you?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a big sister to me, but actually acting like a normal big sister.\\xa0 It can be misinterpreted.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She hadn\\u2019t quite adopted her deadpan expression, but as I gave my order, her expression changed.\\xa0 She smiled, and it was warm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour hair <em>is</em> a mess,\\u201d she said, and her voice matched her expression.\\xa0 She reached up and fussed with it, running her long fingernails against my scalp as she fixed it up a bit.\\xa0 Probably better than I could have if I\\u2019d had a comb and more time.\\xa0 She fixed the hair that went from the center of my hairline to my temple, brushing it up and more out of the way, and then let her hand linger, a quarter second too long.\\xa0 \\u201cYou should focus more on appearances.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI should,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s time to learn.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can always teach you the particulars,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you\\u2019re able to keep yourself in one piece long enough.\\xa0 I\\u2019m glad to see you\\u2019ve been put back together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She gave me a rub on the arm where I\\u2019d been burned, then leaned close to kiss me on the forehead.</p>\\n<p>Again, her face remained closer to mine for just a heartbeat longer than it needed to.\\xa0 With the proximity, I couldn\\u2019t help but think that I found her scarier than I\\u2019d found the snake charmer\\u2019s experiment.\\xa0 I knew it was purely my imagination, but I imagined it was how I\\u2019d feel if I was dropped in a tiger\\u2019s enclosure at the zoo, the resident sitting the same distance from me.</p>\\n<p>Still, I smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cI like me being in one piece too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t look, but I was very aware that of the large group that was filing into the door, a great many boys were paying a great deal of attention to the exchange.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn we go,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cKeep an eye out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We joined the crowd.\\xa0 Gordon took up the rear, guarding our backs.</p>\\n<p>I only realized at the last second that him watching our backs was a <em>bad</em> thing.\\xa0 A hand reached out in my peripheral vision, and Gordon caught it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWoah there, Bruno,\\u201d a boy our age said, \\u201cEase up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon let go of the hand.\\xa0 \\u201cCalling me names, now?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust poking fun.\\xa0 I\\u2019m a <em>pal</em>, Gordon.\\xa0 Relax,\\u201d the boy said.\\xa0 He pulled his hand free of Gordon\\u2019s grip.</p>\\n<p>The boy was dark haired, with dark brown eyes, but very much of the same type as Gordon.\\xa0 Big, healthy in stature and build without showing a hint of being <em>fat</em>, handsome, and confident enough that he was probably one of the top dogs.\\xa0 Between me and Gordon in size, a couple inches taller than me, an inch shorter than Gordon.\\xa0 Twelve or so?</p>\\n<p>He smiled at me.\\xa0 \\u201cWho\\u2019s slick here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy.\\xa0 Sylvester if you want to be polite,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cShowed us around before we made our way to Mothmont.\\xa0 Sylvester, this is Ed.\\xa0 Ed is a good guy to know if you want to know people.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve been hanging out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNice way to put it.\\xa0 You mentioned you\\u2019d figured out where things were,\\u201d the boy said.\\xa0 \\u201cHi Helen, Lil, and Ja- James?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie.\\xa0 Sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We were moving with the rest of the crowd, heading into the school proper.\\xa0 I was very aware of those who were moving past me.\\xa0 If they were as brazen as the others had insinuated, I wasn\\u2019t sure a knife wouldn\\u2019t find one of us while we were part of this press of bodies.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me about yourself, Sy,\\u201d Ed urged me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing to tell,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m nobody important.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Reel him in\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>Ed laughed, but it was a laugh for his own benefit, and probably for the others who were watching from a distance.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t get into Mothmont without being important somehow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot in on an ask,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m from the orphanage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah?\\u201d he asked, and there was interest in his voice, with a hint of something else.\\xa0 The question had more than basic curiosity backing it.\\xa0 \\u201cHow\\u2019s that work?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomeone liked me, I guess,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I shot Helen a smile.\\xa0 She smiled back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not really an answer, buddy,\\u201d he said, but there was a bit of a <em>push</em> to the statement.\\xa0 Insistence.\\xa0 Not just that, but really, \\u2018<em>buddy\\u2019?\\xa0</em> He was acting like he was an adult and I was the kid, but he only had a few inches on me.\\xa0 It irritated, and I was feeling particularly irritable.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly answer I\\u2019m going to give,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry about it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw a flicker of annoyance on his face.\\xa0 He blew a bit of air through his lips, \\u201cPff.\\xa0 I was just being friendly, there\\u2019s no need to brush me off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not brushing you off.\\xa0 I\\u2019m hinting that you\\u2019re butting your nose in where it isn\\u2019t wanted.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ed laughed, again, and I could hear a distinct difference between the laugh <em>now</em> and the laugh just a few seconds ago.\\xa0 Tighter at the edges.\\xa0 More forced than natural.</p>\\n<p>We were in the hallway between various classrooms, and the crowd was thinning out, which made me feel a little less worried for my own skin.\\xa0 The classrooms each had windows between the class and the hallway, and the window frames were <em>grown, </em>large pieces of broken glass collected with what looked like tree branches growing to hold them in place, glass effectively filling the gaps between each branch.\\xa0 Past those windows and the classrooms, I could see the yard and the street beyond the school.</p>\\n<p>Things were so <em>clean</em>.\\xa0 Bright, crisp, all polished and white-painted wood.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t like it when things were this done-up.\\xa0 It felt dishonest.\\xa0 Nicer people tried to make something look, the less I trusted it.</p>\\n<p>A place as nice as <em>this</em>, trying to be classy?\\xa0 Murderous students felt like the least of its problems.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy\\u2019s usually like this,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry about it, Ed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ed was smiling, but it was a forced smile in the same way the laugh had been.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not worried, really.\\xa0 I just have to wonder about the company you keep.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWonder?\\xa0 Why?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 Keeping him talking, talking on his feet.\\xa0 I was more comfortable with a fast-moving conversation than most.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been given a rosy opportunity like this, kid like you in a place like this, me offering a hand in friendship, and you snub me?\\xa0 Not wise, limiting yourself like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKid like me, huh?\\u201d\\xa0 <em>Force him to justify, put myself apparently off balance, trying to adjust, adapt\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cKid like you.\\xa0 Of less established breeding, no offense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He totally meant offense.\\xa0 It <em>killed</em> me that he was giving me a golden line like that and I couldn\\u2019t give it what it deserved.\\xa0 I had to go easy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo offense taken,\\u201d I said, smiling.\\xa0 There was a teacher not too far away, watching the children in the hallway, making sure her students made their way to her class without dallying.\\xa0 I gave my response, smiling at him. \\u201cIt\\u2019s <em>funny</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t seem to comprehend.\\xa0 Now I had the reins of the dialogue.\\xa0 He was forced to ask.\\xa0 \\u201cFunny?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomeone clearly <em>inbred</em> talking about my breeding.\\xa0 It-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He grabbed me by the front of my uniform and shoved me against the wall, hard.\\xa0 Some students around us gasped, stopping in their tracks or forming a loose circle around us.</p>\\n<p>The teacher had noticed, and was heading our way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWoah there, Bruno,\\u201d I echoed him from earlier.</p>\\n<p>He pulled me away, then shoved me against the wall again.</p>\\n<p>Then there was laughter.</p>\\n<p>Helen.\\xa0 She had one hand to her mouth, and in her attempts to stifle a giggle, she \\u2018accidentally\\u2019 snorted.</p>\\n<p>Ed stared at her.\\xa0 There was something raw in the look.</p>\\n<p>Whatever else he was, he was still only twelve or so.\\xa0 He could be good with words, handsome, smart, whatever else it took to be one of the top dogs of Mothmont, but he was new to liking girls, and he was very conscious of his other friends, who were hanging back, watching.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d she told him.\\xa0 \\u201cReally, Edward, I\\u2019m sorry.\\xa0 But you have to admit Sy\\u2019s line was funny.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I love you, Helen</em>, I thought.\\xa0 She\\u2019d figured out my angle and here she was, supporting me perfectly.</p>\\n<p>The teacher was forging his way through the ring of students.\\xa0 Ed had noticed, and he had to save face.\\xa0 Had it not been for Helen, he might have socked me one in the stomach and left it be until later.\\xa0 But he couldn\\u2019t very well hit me without going against her.</p>\\n<p>He was cornered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t over,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to continue this later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre we?\\xa0 Easy to say, but so many chicken out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He leaned close and whispered, \\u201cAfter classes, in the corner of the yard, where the two trees will give us some privacy,\\u201d he said, making a show of letting go of my uniform.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll believe it when I see you there,\\u201d I murmured my response.</p>\\n<p>The teacher broke through.\\xa0 Ed pulled away, hands in the air.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this?\\u201d the teacher asked, stern, one hand on her hip.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAll good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll good,\\u201d Ed joined in.\\xa0 \\u201cJust playing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She gave us a curious look.\\xa0 \\u201cGet to your classes.\\xa0 Mary, Eliza, I see you talking there, get to your desks, I\\u2019m starting the lesson soon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her attention was already elsewhere, gathering up and ordering around kids she knew she had clout with.\\xa0 The rest fell in step.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m disappointed, Gordon,\\u201d Ed said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can talk later?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t want bad blood between us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe, sure,\\u201d Ed said, but Gordon wasn\\u2019t his focus here, or even second in his focus.\\xa0 The boy left, turning his back to Helen and me as he rejoined friends, hands in his pockets.</p>\\n<p>Lillian and Helen hurried to their next class, Helen shooting me a smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen you set your mind to it, you\\u2019re <em>remarkably</em> good at getting people to hate you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cPoor sap.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe or him?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Him</em>,\\u201d Gordon said, sounding offended at the question.\\xa0 \\u201cYou and Helen teaming up on him.\\xa0 Why\\u2019d you go and do that to him?\\xa0 You knew you\\u2019d get <em>someone\\u2019s</em> goat by having Helen be gentle to you, and you did, and then you twisted the damn knife.\\xa0 If you wanted to verify that he wasn\\u2019t one of the people who were trying to kill us, you could have asked me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, I wasn\\u2019t thinking that,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat were you thinking, then?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey say when you go to prison, you should murder someone or join a gang.\\xa0 Idea is that you want to figure out the pecking order and fit yourself into it somehow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He glanced around, noting that the number of students in the hallway had thinned out pretty dramatically.\\xa0 We were almost alone, and the students that were around were <em>hurrying</em>.\\xa0 \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t prison.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe hell it isn\\u2019t.\\xa0 But that\\u2019s beside the point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen why bring it up?\\u201d He was quick to retort.</p>\\n<p>I sighed, \\u201cI\\u2019m establishing the pecking order.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He put both hands on my shoulders, leaning close.\\xa0 \\u201cI hate to say it\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou love to say it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn all the years I\\u2019ve known you, watching you from the beginning, I have never ever known you to win a fight.\\xa0 Or even put in a good showing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t say I\\u2019d be at the top of the pecking order,\\u201d I protested.</p>\\n<p>Gordon stepped back, and he looked at Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo be fair, he didn\\u2019t,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe just got him back, and we\\u2019re going to have to send him right back to the Academy for more medical care,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt won\\u2019t be that bad,\\u201d I protested, again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you shooting for, Sly?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cGotta fill us in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou guys stalled because you\\u2019re too <em>safe</em>.\\xa0 Were you watching the crowd?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnyone paying too much attention?\\xa0 Trying not to look like they were looking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon shook his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA few faces caught my eye,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI can point them out later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe shake things up, see what happens,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat moves, what doesn\\u2019t, what doesn\\u2019t move like it should.\\xa0 We pay attention to what comes next, and we might get clues.\\xa0 I just happened to draw everyone\\u2019s attention, and whoever was paying attention to you lot is paying extra special attention to <em>me</em> now.\\xa0 I\\u2019m betting they\\u2019re confused.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI suspect the only person who really gets how you think is you, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen gets me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen is-\\u201d Gordon started.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI get it too.\\xa0 But you should be ready.\\xa0 You might be a target, Sy,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know.\\xa0 I expect it.\\xa0 You guys have been worrying about knives in the back or poisonings up until now, it\\u2019s only fair I have my turn at it.\\xa0 The way and timing of their response is going to be important, so keep your eyes open.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>We were getting dirty looks from teachers that were just starting their classes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPass it on to the girls?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI will,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWatch yourselves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I resumed our trek to our class.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s not good at this,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis kind of task.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said, glancing back at Gordon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHis talents don\\u2019t really lend themselves to it.\\xa0 Maybe one day, but not today.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is more my domain,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen\\u2019s.\\xa0 Yours to a lesser degree.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpeaking of your domain, what\\u2019s the scoop on the guy I just picked a fight with?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 He\\u2019s not in our classes.\\xa0 Gordon\\u2019s kept an eye on him, I haven\\u2019t had a reason to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not worried, are you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI figured if I had a few choice attacks I could fire his way, I could position myself better.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want to be at the very bottom of any pecking orders.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll find out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie\\u2019s long hair was pulled back into a sailor\\u2019s ponytail, low and resting against the neck, which wasn\\u2019t how he normally wore it.\\xa0 It was nearly invisible with his collar up.\\xa0 I reached out and flicked it with my finger.</p>\\n<p>He jabbed me in response, which prompted me to bump his shoulder with my own, almost sending him into the nearest classroom door.\\xa0 He did the same to me, to less effect.</p>\\n<p>The exchange continued for a few seconds, until he stopped all at once. \\u201cStop, we\\u2019re at the class.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll see.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I immediately fell back into a regular walk, pulling my uniform top down.\\xa0 Still in the hallway, we had to walk by the tree-branch window that ran along the length of the classroom to reach the door.\\xa0 Jamie pushed his glasses up his nose and fixed his ponytail.</p>\\n<p>When he was all fixed up, I surreptitiously gave him a jab in the side of his stomach with one of my fingers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll get you for that,\\u201d he murmured.\\xa0 He opened the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re late,\\u201d the teacher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe headmistress said Jamie should show me around,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The woman pursed her lips.\\xa0 \\u201cI see.\\xa0 Take your seats, please.\\xa0 You can sit by Jamie\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Get the notes from Jamie later.\\xa0 For now, just sit and follow what you can.\\u201d\\xa0 She walked over to her desk and made a note on what I assumed was an attendance list.</p>\\n<p>I was very aware of the subtle smiles or glances from various students.\\xa0 Ones that had seen Ed pushing me up against the wall, knowing full well that I\\u2019d been stretching the truth.\\xa0 My eye quickly traveled over the boys and girls that weren\\u2019t smiling.</p>\\n<p>I wouldn\\u2019t be able to remember the particulars, which ones looked like they were trying too hard not to look at me, or who weren\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>Jamie would.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow, back to what I was saying.\\xa0 Wollstone\\u2019s ratios are used in seventy percent of what you\\u2019ll be doing if you go on to attend the Academy.\\xa0 The <em>golden ratio</em>, seen here, could be said to be the precursor to what would eventually be Wollstone\\u2019s nine ratios.\\xa0 With a few quick measurements, we can quickly divine which of the nine ratios is used for a given organism\\u2019s physical structure or composition, and working backward, so long as we can keep to the ratio, we can trust that the organism has the fundamental supports for life.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>For example,</em> if you\\u2019ll turn to page seventy-five, we can see where the fundamental pattern of a cat is outlined.\\xa0 Keeping to Wollstone\\u2019s \\u2018wise\\u2019 ratio, we can discern which parts of the pattern apply to specific parts of the cat.\\xa0 Now, it gets more complicated when we decide to alter the pattern, or the <em>how</em> of it, but you should begin to have a glimmer of how a ratio can be used as a shortcut to understanding\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My forehead hit the desk.\\xa0 I closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">To his credit, Ed did know how to throw a punch.\\xa0 He knew how to throw ten.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">To <em>my</em> credit, I managed to stay on my feet until the tenth punch.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t manage to deliver anything substantial in the meantime, but I wasn\\u2019t curling up into a ball and crying uncle.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The group of students around us was smaller than I would have liked.\\xa0 The Lambsbridge orphans, Ed and Gordon\\u2019s friends, and Helen\\u2019s group.\\xa0 Girls for Ed to impress.\\xa0 Maybe it would make up for my baiting him, if he got to look good in front of some girls.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Landing at the base of the tree, I took a second to catch my breath.\\xa0 I raised a hand to make Ed stop.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou done?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re not going to say anything about my family again?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything until you-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I saw him bringing a fist back, ready to hit me again.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I opened my mouth wide, wincing at the feeling at the corner of my jaw.\\xa0 Tight.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">In the process, I saw a movement in the corner of my eye.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There weren\\u2019t many windows that offered a good look at the scene.\\xa0 Three trees had been planted at one corner of the yard, between the glass roof and the building, and they blocked the view from many of the nearby windows.\\xa0 They also served to keep most of the rain off us.\\xa0 Only the girls were wearing hoods and jackets, and I was getting dirty, but not <em>muddy, </em>which was better.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We hadn\\u2019t been obvious about our fight, and anyone who had a reason to watch was going to be part of this crowd.\\xa0 But, still, three boys had paid enough attention to us to know the fight was happening, and had found one vantage point inside where they could peer past the gaps in the branches and watch what was happening.\\xa0 One, thirteen or so, was standing in a way that let the curtain block the lower half of his face.\\xa0 The other was far younger, nine or ten, and was leaning forward, hands folded on the windowsill, peering over the bottom of the window to look down at me.\\xa0 The third was somewhere between the two in age, and hung far enough back to be hidden in the gloom of an unlit classroom.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The look in their eyes was clear enough.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As curious as we were about the murderous children, they were curious about <em>us</em>.\\xa0 They couldn\\u2019t know me well enough to know how I operated.\\xa0 Even Mr. Hayle didn\\u2019t, and he\\u2019d practically <em>designed </em>me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ed jabbed me in the middle with the toe of one shoe.\\xa0 \\u201cEh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019re good,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cSorry about saying you\\u2019re inbred, Ed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He didn\\u2019t look appeased.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I glanced toward the classroom again.\\xa0 The boys were gone.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCome on,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s get you looked after.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSaw them,\\u201d I murmured, as he helped me limp on.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhere?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cInside.\\xa0 Three boys.\\xa0 I can give Jamie partial descriptions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThree boys,\\u201d Gordon mused.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s not good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/taking-root-1-6/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>I watched as Jamie used a pen to sketch out a rough image.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHead was narrower.\\xa0 Taller than wide,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMost heads are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat looks round.\\xa0 Also, he didn\\u2019t look sinister, but he didn\\u2019t look interested either.\\xa0 It was cold.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike Helen sometimes looks?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I considered.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou, then.\\xa0 On a bad day, after an appointment?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what I look like after an appointment.\\xa0 They don\\u2019t usually let me have access to reflective surfaces, and I\\u2019m not usually gawking at myself, either.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie leaned back in his chair, and his head bumped my chest, where I was leaning over the back of the chair.</p>\\n<p>He remained where he was, looking up at me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou had a look in your eyes like all the joy had gone out of the world.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDepressed?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cUm\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He turned a page in his notebook.</p>\\n<p>On the fresh page, he began to sketch.\\xa0 He was using a fountain pen that flowed fairly freely, but his hand moved with some speed and dexterity.\\xa0 It was interesting to see, because Jamie wasn\\u2019t a strong artist.\\xa0 He made my eyes too small, the position slightly wrong, paused, then went back, expanding, making the top of the eye into my eyebrows, and drawing my eyes at a larger size.\\xa0 It was a rough sketch, and it was a sketch that showed my face in heavy shadow, the lines noticeable, thick.</p>\\n<p>At first I took it for a caricature, exaggerating my features, but Jamie wasn\\u2019t good enough to do that.\\xa0 The hair was drawn in messy, framing it all, and the lines marked my cheeks as being more gaunt, with thin cross-hatching for the shadows in the recesses, I realized that it wasn\\u2019t a recent picture, that my eyes were larger in proportion to the rest because it was a picture of me, years younger.</p>\\n<p>Near the beginning.</p>\\n<p>Drawing from memory, rather than talent.</p>\\n<p>I leaned forward, and it was as though I were looking into a mirror cast in paper.\\xa0 My eyes were narrow, my lips thin and slightly parted, and all the features of my face and ears were fine to the point of being sharp.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was already putting down notes below and to the side of the image.\\xa0 I glanced at the first.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Drawn for a discussion with Sly, during the Case of the Bad Seeds.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cCase of the bad seeds,\\u201d I commented idly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlaceholder,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He was already going on to write more.\\xa0 Normally I wouldn\\u2019t have been able to resist reading over his shoulder, but I found I couldn\\u2019t keep my eyes off the image for long.\\xa0 The eyes were just scratches of black ink, almost hidden in the shadows that had been etched around them, but they took up much of the focus.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis was\\u2026 that time I had to do two appointments, back to back?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked.\\xa0 Only time my cheeks would have been that hollow.</p>\\n<p>Jamie didn\\u2019t respond, but his pen moved, indicating a line he\\u2019d just jotted down.\\xa0 He tapped his fountain pen against paper, leaving three blotchy dots in the margin.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>From memory: Sly in the Tower, after he ran away.\\xa0 Before he recovered from one month\\u2019s appointment, he had to do the next</em>.</p>\\n<p>Reading the line, I suddenly felt excruciatingly uncomfortable, and the hour-old bruises from my encounter with Ed weren\\u2019t why.\\xa0 Feeling so restless I couldn\\u2019t bear it, I turned away from Jamie, his chair, and his book, and I paced across our little dorm room.\\xa0 Two beds each with a chest at the foot, one desk, and one bedside table between the beds with drawers for us to share.\\xa0 Mothmont was fancy, but not so fancy that we each got a palace.\\xa0 Real estate mattered, if nothing else.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t think we\\u2019d get you back,\\u201d Jamie murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cWe suspected you were <em>lost.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not it,\\u201d I said, forcing my voice to sound different from how I felt.\\xa0 I worried I didn\\u2019t sell it very well.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not like Helen is, and it\\u2019s not like <em>that</em>, okay?\\xa0 That\\u2019s not the look they had.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Jamie said, sounding very normal, placid, and very calm.</p>\\n<p>Though I didn\\u2019t like it, I was finding the conversation helped me to clarify my interpretation.\\xa0 \\u201cThey weren\\u2019t lost.\\xa0 There was emotion there.\\xa0 They were human, but they weren\\u2019t <em>nice</em> humans.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not a nice human sometimes,\\u201d Jamie remarked.</p>\\n<p>I shot him a look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly saying, Sly, only saying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI looked at them, and I <em>knew</em> they were the sorts who\\u2019d stick their parents with something sharp and then light up the family home.\\xa0 Or try to drop a piece of masonry on someone they didn\\u2019t like.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019d-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I narrowed my eyes, making the look darker and more intense.</p>\\n<p>He seemed to give up, pulling his hands away from the page, slumping back.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah, Sy.\\xa0 Got it.\\xa0 But if you can\\u2019t tell me <em>how</em>\\xa0they looked all murderous, I\\u2019m not sure I can draw it.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not sure I can draw them in the first place.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s fine,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t fret about it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThink you\\u2019d recognize them if you saw them?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I saw them?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 They were standing in shadow.\\xa0 If I talked to them, maybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are one thousand, two hundred students at Mothmont, give or take, ranging from year one to year twelve.\\xa0 It\\u2019s going to take you an awful long time to talk to them all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I was still on the far side of the room.\\xa0 Three sets of my uniform had been provided, alongside a little cloak and hood for the rain and an umbrella, all stacked neatly on the chest at the end of the bed.\\xa0 My bedside drawer had a new comb, bottle of toothwash, washcloth, and a new set of books.</p>\\n<p>Nothing that was mine.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t like it.\\xa0 The office back at the hedge with the grille on the windows and the bookcase blocking the door had felt less like a cell than <em>this</em>.</p>\\n<p>There, I\\u2019d been free to be <em>me</em>.\\xa0 Here, I was being made to conform, just like some of the fruit I\\u2019d seen grown at the Academy, placed inside molds that would shape their growth.\\xa0 Fruit shaped like certain animals, or like human faces.</p>\\n<p>Were our murder-children in that same situation?</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m thinking\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah?\\u201d\\xa0 Jamie twisted in his seat, elbow over the back of the chair.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy <em>here</em>?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cResources are available, on multiple fronts.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve got access to children, you\\u2019ve got access to tools and starter labs.\\xa0 Maybe things go missing, maybe it gets put back at the end of the day?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne way or another, something is going on with their heads.\\xa0 Either they\\u2019re being made to do something they normally wouldn\\u2019t, or they\\u2019re not <em>them</em>, and something more nefarious is going on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNefarious?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are parasites that induce suicidal behavior in the host as part of the life cycle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure.\\xa0 Transoplasma Felidae.\\xa0 Feverish behavior and a compulsion to drown oneself.\\xa0 Weaponized version was Transoplasma Necis, but that saw reams of people biting off their own tongues to choke on the tongue or aspirating the blood.\\xa0 Well known enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll take your word for it.\\xa0 Maybe the students we\\u2019re talking about have a parasite in their heads, something that\\u2019s making them act funny.\\xa0 Maybe we\\u2019re dealing with the parasites and not the children themselves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie seemed to consider a moment.\\xa0 \\u201cRaises questions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou ask, I try to justify.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy do they care about us?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re complex.\\xa0 Pre-set instructions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t buy that someone capable of that would be here and not at the Academy, making a fortune.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen they\\u2019re paranoid.\\xa0 Like they\\u2019re rabid, they\\u2019re wary of everything.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy <em>us</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I started to come up with an explanation, then dismissed it.\\xa0 Felt weak, like too much of a reach.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat if it made them suggestible?\\xa0 Broke down the walls in their heads, left them open to receiving instruction?\\xa0 Get access to the children, slip them something that leaves them open to being influenced.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019d see it in their behavior,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 That they\\u2019d be willing to take orders?\\xa0 Follow the rest of the sheep?\\xa0 We\\u2019re in a <em>school</em>, Jamie,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoint.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA <em>highbrow</em> school.\\xa0 Look, I\\u2019m not sold on the parasite idea.\\xa0 But we\\u2019ve got an awful lot of <em>children</em> here, ones that might be more vulnerable to whatever, or of an age where some symptoms might be easier to hide.\\xa0 Maybe the fact that we\\u2019re all fitting into some cookie cutter archetype is an advantage for our puppeteer in the background.\\xa0 If their little experiments feel disoriented?\\xa0 Have lost memories?\\xa0 If their behavior is a little outside the norm?\\xa0 All our \\u2018bad seed\\u2019 has to do is imitate their peers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie was nodding, already thinking the idea through, rounding it out, \\u201cIf they act too far out of line, then the faculty steps in, gets them to shape up.\\xa0 If <em>that</em> fails\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat happens when someone futzes up and doesn\\u2019t look like they\\u2019re going to straighten out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDetention,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr a talk with the headmistress.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t think she\\u2019s the one doing it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I rolled my head to one side, then the other.\\xa0 \\u201cI talked to the woman.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t get that sense out of her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave Jamie an annoyed look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s good to think about why,\\u201d Jamie said, his voice quiet but not meek.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have a good sense of things, but it\\u2019s important to identify the details that are feeding into that sense.\\xa0 You see little details, and your brain picks them up and puts them into storage, while your conscious mind doesn\\u2019t register them.\\xa0 Prey animals use that low-level awareness a lot, figuring out that a predator could be nearby, and we still have traces of that prey thinking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t see myself as a prey animal,\\u201d I said, smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe idea is sound, Sy.\\xa0 We all use that sense to some extent, but you\\u2019re a little better than most.\\xa0 You can train it, but training it starts with being <em>aware</em>.\\xa0 Think about your surroundings, pay attention to the details, and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A knock sounded at the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou two decent in there?\\u201d Gordon asked, voice muffled by the intervening door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAm I <em>ever</em> decent?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>The door opened.\\xa0 But it wasn\\u2019t just Gordon, which surprised me.\\xa0 He was accompanied by a boy, narrow in build, with thick eyebrows and wiry black hair cut a finger\\u2019s width from his head.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t look like one of the boys that would be in Gordon\\u2019s cadre.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe ran into each other at the door,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know him,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBook trade?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d the boy said.\\xa0 He held out two dime novels.\\xa0 \\u201cRead them?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie glanced at the novels, \\u201cYes.\\xa0 But it\\u2019s fine.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll trade.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He opened a drawer in the desk, pulling out five more dime novels.\\xa0 \\u201cDoll Man and the song of the moon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRead it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoll man and the revenge of the swarm queen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s out?\\u201d\\xa0 The boy stuck out his hand.\\xa0 Jamie dutifully handed over the book, no more than a hundred pages.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI liked this one,\\u201d Jamie said, \\u201cBut you might want to wait until there\\u2019s more material.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d the boy asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>I turned, and I started to cross the room, before I saw Gordon moving in the same direction.\\xa0 He was faster, and he was closer.\\xa0 I deferred to him.</p>\\n<p>Before Jamie was able to process just what had grabbed the boy\\u2019s attention, Gordon touched the cover of Jamie\\u2019s notebook and flipped it over.\\xa0 It slapped closed and slid a bit across the desk.</p>\\n<p>Jamie put a hand out to stop it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s Jamie\\u2019s journal,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t read someone\\u2019s journal, pal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d the boy said.\\xa0 He turned a little pink.\\xa0 \\u201cDidn\\u2019t know, sorry Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat picture was something.\\xa0 Scary, if I can say so,\\u201d the boy said, turning to look at me.\\xa0 \\u201cThat was you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t comment on someone\\u2019s journal if you happen to get a look at it, either,\\u201d Gordon said, his voice firm.</p>\\n<p>The boy\\u2019s face turned even pinker.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMickey,\\u201d Jamie said, offering a bit of relief where I would have pressed the advantage. \\u201cTake a look.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie held the other three little novels so they fanned out.\\xa0 A lady in white and a rat crawling out of the darkness, a man with a bird mask, and a handsome young man with a dog accompanying him through a forest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that last one?\\u201d Mickey asked.</p>\\n<p>Jamie pulled it away before Mickey could grab it.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen we stopped by the Academy last weekend, you see anyone go off in a very small group?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery small?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore than three, less than ten.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh.\\xa0 Some special students got instruction with professors, or got to sit in on classes.\\xa0 Top of certain classes, or something.\\xa0 But they were alone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, I don\\u2019t think so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, thanks anyway,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He put the books down, then handed over the one Mickey had expressed interest in.\\xa0 \\u201cBarber John and the dark forest monster.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon stepped out of the way while the boy headed back to the hallway.\\xa0 He closed the door behind him, and stood with his back to it.\\xa0 \\u201cAsking questions like that can draw attention.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m very careful about who I ask,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He seemed to take that at face value.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t mention Jamie\\u2019s lapse about the book.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and I wouldn\\u2019t go after Jamie for that any more than any of the others would come after me for my behavior after an appointment.\\xa0 We had our strengths, and we had our individual weak points.\\xa0 If everything was working as it should, we covered the weak points and highlighted the strengths.</p>\\n<p>That meant accepting that sometimes Jamie had enough stuff in his head that he was a little slower to get things rolling when surprised.</p>\\n<p>If <em>I\\u2019d</em> been on the ball, I would have reminded Jamie, but my head hurt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s time for dinner,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThought I\\u2019d check in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStill alive,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo surprise murders.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s expression didn\\u2019t twitch.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat do you think?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were thinking maybe the structure of the school is being used to shape or correct behavior where it might go off rails,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 I cleared my throat, and Jamie amended his statement to say, \\u201cSy thought so.\\xa0 It makes some sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething to watch out for?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cQuirks in behavior, students pushing the limit and getting pushed back in line by the group,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd it might be worth seeing who is in charge of correcting the students when they get too problematic.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cOur mad doctor or doctors act the role of the murderer, the children are the murder weapon, and that weapon needs to be kept controlled and concealed.\\xa0 The school is a setting for it.\\xa0 That still leaves questions.\\xa0 Who, how, why.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho is the murderer, how are they doing this with the students, and why are they doing it?\\xa0 What\\u2019s the motive?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow, also, are they giving orders?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThe students here got orders to kill us.\\xa0 When?\\xa0 What form did it take?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFood for thought,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I perked up.\\xa0 \\u201cSpeaking of food\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was contrived,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrain feels sluggish, and I haven\\u2019t had an actual meal in\\u2026\\u201d I counted on my fingers, then paused, stuck.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen did we eat, before the snake charmer?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon blinked.\\xa0 \\u201cAt that point, I think the question is academic.\\xa0 Have you had <em>water</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI had some water, yeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you hadn\\u2019t, I\\u2019d wonder how you were still standing.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s slap a feedbag on that face of yours, Sy.\\xa0 And you wonder why you\\u2019re short.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I grabbed the comb from the bedside table and hucked it at his head.\\xa0 He caught it, which didn\\u2019t surprise me.</p>\\n<p>We collected ourselves, getting our things.\\xa0 Jamie picked up his notebook, tucking it under one arm.\\xa0 The pen was capped and slipped into a breast pocket.\\xa0 Gordon was all set up, and all <em>I </em>needed was a bit of protection from any rain.</p>\\n<p>The school was arranged into a square, with the yard in the middle.\\xa0 The front entrance sat at the southern wall with the front office, infirmary and other administrative rooms.\\xa0 The west and east sides of the square had classrooms.\\xa0 The more interesting area was the northern end, furthest from the entrance.\\xa0 Here, we had the dorms, boys at the west corner, girls at the east.\\xa0 The two sides of the dorms were separated by the teacher\\u2019s quarters and washrooms on the upper floors, and a spacious dining room on the lower floor.\\xa0 I supposed the idea was that it made mingling harder.</p>\\n<p>The dorms were ordered by year, with the older students on the upper floors, and being right in the upper-middle of the range of ages, we were left to make our way down on our way to the dining room.</p>\\n<p>My eyes searched the crowd, looking for a familiar face or feature.\\xa0 I\\u2019d told Jamie I wasn\\u2019t sure if I could place them, but that didn\\u2019t stop me from trying.\\xa0 Kids milled around us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEd was asking about you, before your little tussle under the tree,\\u201d Gordon commented.\\xa0 Keeping the conversation to stuff we could talk about freely.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTussle?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m trying to phrase it so I don\\u2019t hurt your feelings, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said, sounding as condescending as he was able.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause if I was honest, I\\u2019d have to say you didn\\u2019t just embarrass yourself.\\xa0 You embarrassed <em>all</em> of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I jabbed him.\\xa0 He took it without flinching.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m guessing that, following your usual pattern, you\\u2019re going to get in trouble, ostensibly to see how the justice system of Mothmont operates?\\u201d\\xa0 Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>The question could be taken two ways.\\xa0 Anyone hearing would think I was a troublemaker, which wasn\\u2019t <em>wrong</em>, but he was asking if I\\u2019d see which faces or individuals might be tied to the correction of errant students.\\xa0 Or errant \\u2018bad seeds\\u2019, as the case went.</p>\\n<p>The maneuver had other uses.\\xa0 If our opposition here was less graceful, they might well get <em>themselves</em> into trouble, just to follow me or keep an eye on me.\\xa0 Simply paying attention to see who acted and reacted after I got myself into trouble could reveal a great deal.</p>\\n<p>But my answer to Gordon was a, \\u201cNot just yet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStill waiting to see what happens after my brawl with Ed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie, trailing a bit behind us, snickered audibly.</p>\\n<p>Gordon openly scoffed.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Brawl</em>.\\xa0 You got <em>beat</em>, Sy.\\xa0 I was talking to some of the others, and Ed actually got <em>worried</em> when someone suggested that you might be a real scrapper, growing up in the orphanage.\\xa0 I nearly split something, trying not to laugh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHa ha,\\u201d I said, without humor.</p>\\n<p>We reached the end of the dining room, and the girls were filtering in through the door on the far side. \\xa0 It was <em>nice, </em>very spacious, all long tables of dark wood, benches, with the two sides separated by a buffet style table.</p>\\n<p>The kitchen was visible, a recessed area, with the chefs busy at work over various stoves.\\xa0 Students aged twelve to sixteen were wearing aprons, carrying food out.\\xa0 Racks of bread, bowls of salad and empty glasses were placed on the table, while larger pots of food were placed on the buffet table, beside stacks of plates.\\xa0 Stew, soups, and portions of meat.</p>\\n<p>From the smell in the kitchen, they were already working on dessert.</p>\\n<p>I took it all in, studying it.\\xa0 The system.</p>\\n<p>Gordon leaned close, murmuring, \\u201cPut yourself into their shoes.\\xa0 How many ways can you see, to poison someone?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPre-assigned seats?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, but they\\u2019ll call us together by homeroom for a roll call soon,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMake sure all the students are present and accounted for,\\u201d Gordon elaborated.</p>\\n<p><em>Dust the glasses with something, poison the silverware, deliver the poison while serving water, refresh the bread bowl or salad, drop something in the food while we go from the buffet to our seats, or simply take advantage of the bumps and shoves that come with being in a crowd of hungry students to stick us with a needle</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeven off the top of my head.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian and I counted out twelve ways they could\\u2019ve gotten me, looking back in retrospect,\\u201d Gordon murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie and Helen added one each once they got back from the Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKind of takes the joy out of eating for the first time in a week,\\u201d I murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t eat too much on an empty stomach anyway,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I made a face, but I didn\\u2019t take my eyes off the crowd.\\xa0 I saw Helen and Lillian on the other side.\\xa0 Helen had a <em>bevvy</em> of girls around her, and she was playing it up.\\xa0 Lillian stood off to one side, talking to a teacher.</p>\\n<p>Oddly in her element, in a very not-the-way-she-acts-at-home way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIncidentally,\\u201d I said, still looking over the crowd for a glimpse of the boys I\\u2019d seen through the window.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t see any telltale signs, and I <em>certainly</em> didn\\u2019t see them together as a group.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat do we do if I happen to spot a possible culprit?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSignal me and Helen.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll go after him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cEasier if you\\u2019re together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll sit together as a group.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Sure enough, we were called to specific tables by our homeroom teachers.\\xa0 They read our names off of lists, and then gave the official go-ahead to get food.</p>\\n<p>I held back out of the way while everyone stampeded for the buffet table, or ran over to reunite with friends.\\xa0 Nobody returned to the seats they\\u2019d been in for the nightly attendance, and the teachers didn\\u2019t enforce anything.\\xa0 There were striations by year and groupings of cliques, but no divisions beyond that.</p>\\n<p>Helen approached with a group of her friends, while Gordon went to go talk to his clique.\\xa0 The teenagers had all gathered around the buffet table and were screening out the kids, claiming first pick, but Gordon\\u2019s group looked set to take up the first gap that formed.</p>\\n<p>I appreciated that he going out of his way to stay in our line of sight, allowing us to watch his back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy, was it?\\u201d one of Helen\\u2019s older friends asked.\\xa0 An attractive brunette with her hair in a short bob.\\xa0 She\\u2019d hiked up her skirt just a fraction beneath her uniform top, so the bottom of the skirt was higher, revealing more of her very nice looking legs.</p>\\n<p>I realized I\\u2019d been caught looking, and met her eyes without a trace of shame or guilt, \\u201cYou can call me whatever you want, so long as you give me your name first, and maybe the number of your dorm room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled, amid some \\u2018oohs\\u2019 from other girls in the group, then gave me a pat on the head.\\xa0 \\u201cThat was a good try, and it might have worked, but you\\u2019re a little too young for me, and I like the idea of a man who can stand up for me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou saw my duel with Ed,\\u201d I spoke my realization aloud.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d offer some comforting words, but the less that\\u2019s said, the better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could say I let him win,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid you?\\u201d another girl chimed in, interest piqued.\\xa0 Blonde, like Helen, but more pixieish in many respects.\\xa0 Helen could have been an actress or a model, but this girl made me imagine a ballerina, in build and how she was more expressive in general movement.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 But I could say I did,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever convinced you to pick a fight with Ed Willard?\\u201d the brunette asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome people are born to be the hero of a story,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI was born to be the villain.\\xa0 I see the charming, good looking, obnoxiously noble type of guy and I feel compelled to start a battle I\\u2019m doomed to lose.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes that include monologues while you\\u2019re winning and standing over the bloody hero?\\u201d another girl asked, a smile on her face, suggesting she was well versed in that sort of thing.\\xa0 Not many girls read the books and dime novels meant for boys.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou saw my poor showing earlier.\\xa0 I haven\\u2019t gotten that far.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I heard a few chuckles and smiles, and belatedly realized that I\\u2019d effectively and accidentally drawn the attention of Helen\\u2019s entire clique.\\xa0 Heads at other tables and the buffet line were turning, looking at me as some of the more attractive girls in our grade were grouped around me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, wait, I have to poke a hole in your story,\\u201d a girl closer to Helen\\u2019s and my age declared.\\xa0 She was a brunette too, but wore her hair longer, with white ribbons that complemented her school uniform.\\xa0 \\u201cYou say you don\\u2019t get along with good guys, but you get along with Helen\\u2019s friend Gordon, don\\u2019t you?\\xa0 If anyone\\u2019s noble, it\\u2019s him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, Gordon\\u2019s a villain at heart,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if he knows it yet, but there\\u2019s a scoundrel in there just screaming for an excuse.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow would you know that?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause when I was showing these guys around, I saw them with all sorts of people, sometimes in the rougher parts of town.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve seen Gordon here, all nice and ordinary, and I\\u2019ve seen him go toe to toe with people you wouldn\\u2019t want to meet in a dark alley, and they walked away <em>respecting</em> him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A half dozen pairs of eyes turned Gordon\\u2019s way.\\xa0 He caught sight of a crowd of girls giving him serious looks and looked about as bewildered as if I\\u2019d drawn a gun on him.</p>\\n<p>Miss Ribbons wasn\\u2019t looking though.\\xa0 She was focused on me, her right eyebrow raised.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure I believe you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Pixie-blonde chimed in, turning from Gordon to Ribbons, and then to me.\\xa0 She put her hands on her hips.\\xa0 \\u201cAre you being a good friend and trying to get us interested in your fellow over there?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d I said, smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s good if you\\u2019ve given up on making <em>yourself</em> look good, because that ship sailed hours ago,\\u201d Miss Ribbons commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s <em>cruel</em>,\\u201d another girl said.\\xa0 \\u201cI quite like Sy, here, and it\\u2019s noble of this little villain to play up his friend.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>With the words \\u2018I quite like Sy\\u2019, she put her arms around me, giving me a hug.\\xa0 I very nearly ducked out of her grip, but a quick glance at each of her hands suggested that they were empty, with no weapon or needle in evidence.\\xa0 Given the difference in stature, the girl being three years my senior, it pulled the side of my head right into her bosom.</p>\\n<p>A nearby teacher loudly cleared his throat, and my new friend pulled her arms away, raising her hands as if she were being held up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBelieve it or not,\\u201d Helen said, still smiling, acting very much the young coquette, \\u201cSy isn\\u2019t lying.\\xa0 For once.\\xa0 What he said about Gordon was true.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That line spawned more conversation, but my focus was on Gordon.\\xa0 He navigated his way through eager young students, holding four plates in two hands.\\xa0 He looked a little wary of joining the group, with so many eyes on him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d he asked, once he was close enough to ask.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust talking,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHealthy lad,\\u201d the girl who\\u2019d hugged me said, indicating Gordon\\u2019s plates.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor my friends,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Lingering paranoia made me study her expression for any hint of danger.\\xa0 Had she powdered her shirtfront with a poison that could be inhaled?</p>\\n<p>Gordon handed us our individual plates, one for me, Helen, Lillian and Jamie, then asked, \\u201cIs anyone in dire need of a meal?\\xa0 I was going to go back to serve myself, but I can get more plates.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The short-haired brunette raised her hand, smiling way too much at Gordon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s one,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m getting waved over,\\u201d Miss Ribbons said.\\xa0 \\u201cI need to take over for a friend and start serving.\\xa0 She\\u2019s been in the kitchen all day.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood girl.\\xa0 Talk to you later,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnjoy your meals,\\u201d Miss Ribbons said, before dashing off.</p>\\n<p>I watched her retreat, zig-zagging through the crowd on the way to the kitchen, hair and skirt bouncing before she reunited with the friend she\\u2019d mentioned.</p>\\n<p>She glanced back, looking at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do think Mary likes Sy,\\u201d Pixie-blonde said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes Sy like Mary?\\u201d another girl asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to sit,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cCome sit with us, Sy.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think these girls are going to let you go, like this.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve got their claws in you, and I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019ll let you go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Claws</em>?\\u201d a girl asked, archly.</p>\\n<p>Helen, doing her part to keep us together in a very natural seeming way.</p>\\n<p>It took time before everyone had a plate and food.\\xa0 My focus was on the crowd, keeping only enough attention on the conversation to keep up with it.\\xa0 Where were the dynamics?\\xa0 What were the possible approaches for attack?</p>\\n<p>I was exceedingly aware of the state of my food.\\xa0 On such an empty stomach, I couldn\\u2019t afford to get poisoned.\\xa0 We already knew our enemies were aware of us, so I didn\\u2019t mind being a little guarded.\\xa0 One girl commented on it, even, and I explained it away as a casualty of being from the orphanage.\\xa0 That, in itself, spawned more discussion.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and Lillian seemed content to be in the background.\\xa0 Jamie was taking it all in.\\xa0 If something happened, he\\u2019d be able to tell us who was where.</p>\\n<p>Had I been familiar with the dynamic and the situation, I might have been more on point, aware of when it all started to go wrong.\\xa0 It tied into what Jamie had said about the prey instinct.\\xa0 Taking in the subconscious details, things that one\\u2019s mind and attention weren\\u2019t picking up on.</p>\\n<p>Changes in volume, shifts in tone.\\xa0 The behavior of people at the fringes and in the background.</p>\\n<p>Little boys who were hunched over their plates.</p>\\n<p>It only clicked when I saw that dessert was being served, and that the cooks and serving girls were looking a little nonplussed.\\xa0 I paid attention to what <em>they</em> were sensing with their own prey\\u2019s instinct.</p>\\n<p>That dessert was being placed on the table, and very few students seemed inclined to go get it.</p>\\n<p>Looking around, I saw expressions of pain.\\xa0 People squirming.\\xa0 Not a <em>lot</em>, but as I watched, I saw it was getting worse.</p>\\n<p>I dropped my knife and fork.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t eat,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Helen, Gordon, Lillian, and Jamie dropped their utensils.</p>\\n<p><em>They didn\\u2019t settle for poisoning us</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>They poisoned everyone</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>Why?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d Erma, the pixie-haired blonde said.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought I felt full, but now-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She raised a hand to her mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust nausea?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 She got a nod.\\xa0 \\u201cFeverish?\\xa0 Does it hurt?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Whatever she was feeling, I didn\\u2019t experience it.\\xa0 My friends didn\\u2019t either.</p>\\n<p>Maybe a handful of people had escaped it, whatever it was.</p>\\n<p>My mind was going a mile a minute as I took it in, tried to figure out the approach.</p>\\n<p>What was the goal, the plan?</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d hit everyone, but missed us.\\xa0 Was it an accident, luck on our part, Gordon being safe?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe teachers are affected too,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t seem to be serious,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019ll get explained away as a stomach thing.\\xa0 Something improperly cooked, perhaps.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>As if to answer her statement, someone threw up.\\xa0 It seemed to set off a chain reaction.\\xa0 People were rising from their seats, hurrying out of the dining hall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe entire school is going to be shut down,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cEveryone in their beds for at least the next few hours, if not the next day.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Everyone.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not a frame, or they would have left the teachers alone, done more to set us up.</em><em>\\xa0 Again, I have to wonder\\u2026 why</em>?</p>\\n<p>My eye fell on Miss Ribbons.</p>\\n<p>I felt the uneasiness, watching her.\\xa0 I saw the look in her eyes.\\xa0 Just the same as the boys had been.</p>\\n<p>I jerked my head, and the others looked, following my gaze.\\xa0 Miss Ribbons was already making a hasty exit, pulling off her apron.\\xa0 If anyone asked, I bet she\\u2019d say she was going to the nurse.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNobody to look after us, or keep us out of trouble,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>Locking down the school.\\xa0 They were largely free to roam, or to feign being sick until our backs were turned, but I suspected it wouldn\\u2019t be so easy or safe for <em>us</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>They\\u2019re making a play, and we\\u2019re still completely in the dark about what they are and what they\\u2019re

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/03/26/taking-root-1-7/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>With the people starting to vomit or rising from their seats to run for the nearest toilet, it was pretty clear that something was wrong.\\xa0 Students were getting distressed, and students were getting scared.\\xa0 The teachers weren\\u2019t in great shape either.</p>\\n<p>Our opposition was smart.\\xa0 Whatever was going on, they were capable of making plans with multiple phases or steps.\\xa0 Knowing we\\u2019d already served ourselves, they\\u2019d tainted the food, affecting most of the other students and teachers.\\xa0 Probably.\\xa0 It fit with Miss Ribbons\\u2019 actions and the general timeline.</p>\\n<p>Mary.\\xa0 Helen\\u2019s friends had called her Mary.</p>\\n<p>Our seats at the table were arranged with intent.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t anything we\\u2019d blatantly coordinated or organized, but we\\u2019d simply accepted it as an approach.\\xa0 At the table furthest from the kitchen, Jamie, Lillian and I sat on the bench with the wall right behind us, Helen and a share of Gordon\\u2019s friends on either side.\\xa0 Helen and Gordon themselves were opposite Jamie and I, their backs to the rest of the dining room.</p>\\n<p>The position meant that Jamie and I could observe the room, and getting to us was rather more difficult.\\xa0 Gordon and Helen could look after themselves, for the most part, if someone happened to approach from behind.</p>\\n<p>I leaned over to Jamie, and I took advantage of the general noise, bustle, and distraction of the other students to murmur in his ear.\\xa0 \\u201cThe other students are too smart to reveal themselves in the midst of this.\\xa0 Watch the teachers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I met Gordon and Helen\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 This was an awkward situation, because we couldn\\u2019t coordinate by speech without cluing the others in.\\xa0 If we left, we ran the risk of being blindsided.\\xa0 When our enemies were in the shadows and we were in plain sight, the chaos here worked very much against us.\\xa0 While everyone else was distracted or incapacitated, they were free to attack us from any number of angles.\\xa0 If we happened to die, well, even minor food poisoning could kill.</p>\\n<p>That in itself was dangerous, but I was willing to bet there were more layers to this attack.\\xa0 A specific reason they\\u2019d done it this way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He put a hand on Helen\\u2019s shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cYou okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen shook her head.\\xa0 She was already leaning over slightly, one hand to her collarbone.</p>\\n<p>She very briefly met my eye.</p>\\n<p><em>Good.\\xa0 Play along.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you need help?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust walk me to our room?\\u201d Helen asked.\\xa0 There was a tension in her voice, as if she were suddenly trying very hard not to puke.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian isn\\u2019t that strong,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll help.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBoys aren\\u2019t allowed on the girl\\u2019s side,\\u201d was the protest from Erma the pixie-blonde.\\xa0 She looked visibly green around the gills.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpecial circumstances,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re really not allowed,\\u201d Erma protested, again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI really don\\u2019t care,\\u201d Gordon said, firm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll come,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGroups of-\\u201d Erma started, then bit the sentence short as she fought a wave of nausea.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cErma,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet us be gentlemen, okay?\\xa0 We\\u2019re mostly okay, I think.\\xa0 We can walk you to your rooms.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t look happy with that idea, but she wasn\\u2019t able to talk, either.</p>\\n<p>Gordon began to stand, helping Helen out of her seat.\\xa0 He offered a hand to Erma.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe teachers,\\u201d Jamie said, alerting us.</p>\\n<p>My head turned.\\xa0 One of the teachers was standing.\\xa0 He wore slightly old fashioned clothes.\\xa0 His pants clung to his legs, disappearing into boots, while he wore a bright red jacket over a button-up shirt without a tie.\\xa0 He had a strong build, with a prominent barrel chest, and the clothing had a way of making his legs look far too small while his upper body was made to look larger.\\xa0 His hair was the same way, wavy hair across a head that was already very triangular, with a prominent upper brow and pointed chin.</p>\\n<p>The red jacket was unfortunate, not because it was a sad attempt at acting a member of the upper crust, but because his skin was now very flushed, matching the jacket.\\xa0 He was sweating, in obvious discomfort.</p>\\n<p>He hadn\\u2019t escaped the effects of the poison.\\xa0 The man seated to his right and the headmistress another seat down were both looking about as uncomfortable.</p>\\n<p>Had they eaten more, being larger in build?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEveryone!\\u201d Red-jacket boomed out the word.\\xa0 He had a faint but real British accent.</p>\\n<p>The noise level dropped.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething in the meal looks as though it might have been undercooked.\\xa0 Head straight to your dorm rooms.\\xa0 If you have to-\\u201d he paused.\\xa0 \\u201cIt is best if you use the wastebins in your room instead of trying to make your way to the toilets.\\xa0 I expect there will be too much demand.\\xa0 You will be looked after, but go now before you feel any worse.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>We\\u2019ll be looked after</em>?</p>\\n<p>Jamie was staring intently, still in his seat.\\xa0 He stirred when I reached across his field of vision for a pitcher of water, only a quarter of the way filled.\\xa0 I emptied the contents into another pitcher, then slid it across the table to Gordon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we can\\u2019t get to a wastebin,\\u201d I said, \\u201cBetter the jug than the floor.\\xa0 You hold onto it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon took the glass pitcher by the handle, one arm supporting Helen.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t much, but it served as a weapon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo ahead,\\u201d I told Jamie.\\xa0 While he and Lillian circled the table, I emptied another pitcher into the one at the center of the table, holding it in my hands.</p>\\n<p>Not that it mattered too much.\\xa0 If it came down to me needing a weapon to defend myself, I doubted things could be salvaged.</p>\\n<p>Still made me feel better.</p>\\n<p>We headed for the girl\\u2019s dormitory with Helen and a few stragglers.\\xa0 I was glad to be shorter than the norm, as I ducked my head down and let the crowd shield me from the eyes of the teachers.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d hoped that the act of taking care of Helen would let us break away, but there were too many people vacating the dining room.\\xa0 Even those who were well were being driven out by the aroma of vomit.\\xa0 It was humid in the room with the heat from the kitchen and the sheer number of students, and the humidity helped carry the offensive odor.\\xa0 We couldn\\u2019t break away from the crowd, and I wasn\\u2019t sure that the dorm room would be much better.</p>\\n<p>Beside me, an older girl hunched over, making a guttural noise.\\xa0 Everyone near her cleared out of the way.</p>\\n<p>I took advantage of the gap in the crowd to step closer.\\xa0 I stuck the empty pitcher beneath her mouth, pulling my head back and away so I didn\\u2019t have to look as she emptied a portion of her stomach\\u2019s contents.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d she said, still bent over, smiling.</p>\\n<p>She reached to take the pitcher, and I pulled it away from her grasp.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReserved for friends,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She looked a little bewildered and lost.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd here I thought you were a gentleman,\\u201d Erma mumbled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m a bastard, born and bred,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>And there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m handing a weapon over to a potential enemy</em>.</p>\\n<p>With students moving slowly and some pushing or jostling, the way up the stairs looked like more of a jam than any day on King Street.\\xa0 We were probably safe while we were a group, but if the crowd separated us, or if someone tried to slip us the wrong end of a knife while we were in the crush of bodies, I wasn\\u2019t sure we\\u2019d be able to respond accordingly.</p>\\n<p>I saw Gordon shooting Jamie a look, and I sensed that he was thinking along the same lines.</p>\\n<p>We were stuck.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere are the showers?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShowers?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBaths?\\xa0 Where do we wash up?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUpstairs one floor,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cAbove the dining room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He took the question as an instruction, and he and Helen dutifully forged their way into a gap in the crowd.\\xa0 Jamie, Lillian and I hurried to follow, me holding my pitcher off to one side, to avoid the smell.</p>\\n<p>People were <em>slow</em>, some had stopped on the stairs, sitting or on all fours, and there was a smell that suggested they weren\\u2019t all simply throwing up.\\xa0 It was a mess, a disaster, and a stain on Mothmont on many levels.</p>\\n<p>That part of it all was almost certainly a clue.</p>\\n<p>There were a lot of details to be picked out of this.\\xa0 Motivation, approach, the nature of the enemy\\u2026</p>\\n<p>I idly moved the pitcher to one side, intending it to be a shield against anyone reaching for me or holding a weapon, but it ended up serving another purpose.\\xa0 The sight of a glass container filled with vomit made two girls shy back.\\xa0 It was an avenue for me to slip upstairs, skipping ahead three steps, ducking past two students, and stepping to safety, free of the sickly herd.</p>\\n<p>The others followed me as we headed into the girl\\u2019s showers.\\xa0 Two showers were already running, and the room was filled with steam.\\xa0 The floor was white tile, the stalls themselves were wood painted with an exceedingly glossy paint.\\xa0 Each stall was recessed, with hooks and benches before the door and the shower beyond.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey get individual stalls?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy do they get individual stalls?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh,\\u201d Gordon shushed him.</p>\\n<p>Erma had followed us, and staggered past us to the first available stall, where she promptly decorated the floor with her dinner.</p>\\n<p>I glanced around, then pointed.\\xa0 While the others led the way, I stepped to nearby stalls and turned on the water.\\xa0 The hiss of water filled the room.</p>\\n<p>By the time I caught up with the others in the furthest shower back, Helen was standing upright, her expression blank.\\xa0 Gordon stood with a foot resting on one of the little benches at the entry to the stall, while Jamie and Lillian occupied the other short bench.</p>\\n<p>I stood at the entrance to the stall, where I could peek out and keep an eye on the door.\\xa0 Clouds of steam drifted.</p>\\n<p>Helen reached past the others for my pitcher, and I let her have it.\\xa0 Without flinching, she emptied some onto her sleeve.\\xa0 She turned on the water, cold more than warm, and stepped under the stream.\\xa0 The water ran over her, soaking her hair and uniform.\\xa0 The makeup around her eyes ran.</p>\\n<p>I glanced away, my attention on the other stalls.\\xa0 Pacing back a bit, I bent down, peering under stalls.\\xa0 I saw some bare feet and wet socks.\\xa0 It looked like Erma was sitting on the floor of the shower, letting water run over her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWere we followed?\\u201d Gordon asked, his voice low.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t know,\\u201d Jamie murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen things get this <em>messy</em>, it gets harder to keep track of things,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhich might be what they\\u2019re counting on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrying to catch us out?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cShaking things up, yeah.\\xa0 What worries me is <em>Mary</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t have any clue,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Lillian said, reassuring.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s not your fault.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m well aware,\\u201d Helen said, turning her blank expression on Lillian.\\xa0 Anyone else might have sounded irritated, but Helen didn\\u2019t sound <em>anything</em>.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I had an idea and ignored it, then it would be my fault.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2026 okay,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho is she?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThis Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary Elizabeth Coburn,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cHer father isn\\u2019t influential.\\xa0 Accountant to the rich and famous.\\xa0 It\\u2019s why I didn\\u2019t pay particular attention to her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho is her mother?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI just looked at the men, because of the prior pattern.\\xa0 Would have asked, but it\\u2019s harder to ask about a girl\\u2019s mother.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 Most mothers were teachers, nurses, or homemakers.\\xa0 Nothing so interesting that we could <em>ask</em>.\\xa0 There were more women attending the Academy, but few from the last generation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWorth looking into,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He ran his fingers through his golden hair, which was damp with the light spray that had touched it.\\xa0 \\u201cCheck the rest of her family, why she might be selected out of all the students here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could sense how stressed the others were.\\xa0 This maneuver had put us all in a reactionary position, and our options were limited until the other shoe dropped.\\xa0 I volunteered some information, hoping to get them focused again.\\xa0 Not necessarily improving <em>morale</em>, but I doubted that was a real issue.\\xa0 We knew this sort of situation well enough.\\xa0 \\u201cWe know she had a role in this.\\xa0 She might as well have told us to our faces that she was involved, the line about enjoying our meals, the look she gave us. \\xa0 It means something, if she doesn\\u2019t care about us coming after her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cThe puppeteer is using these students as murder weapons.\\xa0 As a killer, he has a pattern.\\xa0 Murder-suicides.\\xa0 One after another.\\xa0 The suicides cover up evidence.\\xa0 If Mary keeps to the pattern, she\\u2019s either going to come after us-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr she\\u2019s going to go home,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He paused.\\xa0 \\u201cOh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I followed his thoughts to the same conclusion.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is the endgame.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d Lillian cut in.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not following.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey know we\\u2019re onto them,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cOur puppeteer somehow figured out about us.\\xa0 Maybe through a connection to the Academy, maybe by some other means.\\xa0 He got scared, and now he\\u2019s wrapping up.\\xa0 Get everyone sick, and in the midst of the chaos he can send his weapons after us, or students are sent home and finish their jobs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr both,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they\\u2019re careful about how they come after us, there\\u2019s nothing saying they can\\u2019t take a run at us and then disappear.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s possible,\\u201d Gordon agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cEspecially if they know who we are, they might not want to pick a fight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I heard a noise and glanced past the entrance to the stall to check the door.</p>\\n<p>Two more students.\\xa0 One was crying.</p>\\n<p>I stepped further into the steam and shadow and eyed them until they disappeared into a stall.\\xa0 No sign of hostility.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEither way,\\u201d Gordon was saying, \\u201cour puppeteer may be wary enough to take a break for a few years, let interest in things die down, or pack up and head to another campus at another school.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis approach here feels ugly.\\xa0 Making students sick?\\xa0 Vomit and shit everywhere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHurts Mothmont where it counts, and what hurts Mothmont hurts the Academy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPersonal,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cNow you\\u2019re getting up to speed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She looked annoyed at that phrasing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have a man-\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-Or woman,\\u201d Jamie cut in.</p>\\n<p>Gordon continued as if he hadn\\u2019t been interrupted, \\u201c-Who considers these children to be expendable assets.\\xa0 He alters them somehow, gives them a target, and has them die after the fact, tidying up the evidence.\\xa0 He does this because he hates the school?\\xa0 That\\u2019s an awful lot of hate.\\xa0 Do we really think he\\u2019s a teacher?\\xa0 That\\u2019s a lot of involvement and hours of the day to spend around something you hate that much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it possible?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said, frowning a little.\\xa0 \\u201cI really don\\u2019t think it is.\\xa0 It feels too <em>spiteful</em>, twisting the knife for good measure when he could simply stab.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat if this isn\\u2019t about the <em>school</em>?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s personal, but it\\u2019s a grudge against a <em>person</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAgainst the headmistress?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>I offered a languid shrug.\\xa0 The moisture in the air was starting to collect on my skin and clothes.\\xa0 I wiped my forehead and pushed my hair back and away from my forehead.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie?\\xa0 Any thoughts on the faculty?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey were talking as a group before Mr. McCairn did his announcement,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe headmistress didn\\u2019t have a lot to say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid students serve the teachers food?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, right from the kitchen,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He paused, glancing to the left, \\u201cMary served the three at the end.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaking the headmistress look bad by keeping her ineffectual,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMore poison or whatever it was-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEmetics,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe laxative.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary gave the headmistress more emetics than anyone else,\\u201d I amended my statement.\\xa0 \\u201cThe question is who would have a grudge against-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sensed a movement out of the corner of my eye.\\xa0 My head turned, my hand and one finger going up for the benefit of the others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo your rooms, <em>now</em>,\\u201d a woman\\u2019s voice cut in.</p>\\n<p>I heard footsteps.\\xa0 Both those belonging to the woman and the footsteps of the fleeing girls.</p>\\n<p>A sharp knock, a few stalls down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOut,\\u201d was the order.</p>\\n<p><em>Doing the rounds, clearing everyone away</em>.</p>\\n<p>Gordon held up his hand, counting off on his fingers, his voice low.\\xa0 \\u201cWho has a grudge against the headmistress?\\xa0 Someone on campus, who can communicate with the students.\\xa0 Who is Mary and why her?\\xa0 Look at who her mother is.\\xa0 What is the mechanism of control?\\xa0 And don\\u2019t forget that they\\u2019re liable to come for us.\\xa0 Be on guard, and don\\u2019t forget they might try to take you out with them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd their families,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they get away\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll step in if it looks like there\\u2019s any danger of that happening,\\u201d Jamie assured her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe will,\\u201d I agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d bet money this ploy of theirs has another angle.\\xa0 Watch out for the angle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were nods.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Out</em>,\\u201d the teacher gave the order, several stalls down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy friends,\\u201d Erma said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey were in here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Selling us out?</em></p>\\n<p>No, Erma didn\\u2019t know we were trying to avoid the spotlight.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo we need to worry about Erma?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot wanting us in the girl\\u2019s dorm was suspicious,\\u201d Gordon said, his voice a whisper.</p>\\n<p>I could hear the teacher\\u2019s approaching footsteps, hard soles on tile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, that?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cHer room\\u2019s a <em>sty</em>.\\xa0 She doesn\\u2019t know how to look after herself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Our entire group collectively relaxed.</p>\\n<p>There was a metal-on-metal squeak as another shower was turned off.</p>\\n<p>I turned to face the woman as she emerged from the steam.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBoys in the girl\\u2019s showers?\\u201d she asked, her voice arching, as if she were about to launch into a tirade.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot another word.\\xa0 This is most certainly <em>not</em> \\u2018okay\\u2019!\\u201d the woman said, building up steam.</p>\\n<p>Helen stumbled forward, lightly headbutting the woman in the solar plexus.\\xa0 With wet hands, she clutched the woman by the shirtfront.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMiss Williams,\\u201d Helen mewled the words, \\u201cI feel so bad.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 I-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen paused, apparently holding back her gorge.</p>\\n<p>Gordon stepped forward, hurrying to offer my pitcher of vomit to the woman.\\xa0 The woman had to fight Helen\\u2019s clutches to get to the pitcher and offer it to the girl.</p>\\n<p>Helen managed to unload a mouthful of vomit and missed the pitcher entirely, dropping it on the floor between the woman\\u2019s feet.\\xa0 She coughed, clutching at the woman\\u2019s shirt again.\\xa0 \\u201cIt hurts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I jumped in.\\xa0 \\u201cWe know her, and she had it worse than anyone, and we didn\\u2019t know what to do.\\xa0 There were so many people on the stairs we weren\\u2019t sure we could get anywhere in time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe had someone else\\u2019s mess on her sleeve,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought she could clean off, but I couldn\\u2019t support her myself, because Erma was there too, so we came here, and she went into the shower like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wanted to get cool,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI feel hot and sweaty and gross and\\u2026\\u201d her words dissolved into incoherent whines.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI-\\u201d the woman started.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease, we don\\u2019t want to get in trouble,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t know any way to help her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt hurts,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy stomach is cramping.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnough,\\u201d the woman said.\\xa0 She managed to extricate herself from Helen.\\xa0 \\u201cEnough of that.\\xa0 You need to act like young <em>adults.</em>\\xa0 I understand that this young lady is feeling unwell, but that\\u2019s no excuse for the rest of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She glanced over us, and we collectively managed to look miserable and pitiful enough to get to her.</p>\\n<p>She gave me a curious look.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat happened to you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cScrap, ma\\u2019am,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The woman made a face.\\xa0 \\u201cBoys, to your dorms, right now.\\xa0 They\\u2019re doing headcounts shortly.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll look after Helen here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We nodded and hurried to obey.</p>\\n<p>Once I was at the entrance to the showers, I glanced back.\\xa0 I could make out Helen with her head resting against the woman\\u2019s chest, giving me a sidelong glance, a light smile on her face.</p>\\n<p>I resisted the urge to smile back.</p>\\n<p>Had things been different, I might have tried to get myself in trouble.\\xa0 As nice as it would have been to see how punishment worked here and if it might be used to keep the bad seeds in line, I didn\\u2019t want to add more complications to a bad situation.</p>\\n<p>I was damp but not <em>wet</em> from the ambient moisture of the shower, and I ventured into a hallway that reeked of sick.\\xa0 The students had been cleared out, but the air would have that bitter taste to it for weeks.</p>\\n<p>Jamie, Gordon and I all made our way down the hall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was good,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBeing able to talk, touch base.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut we\\u2019re on our back foot.\\xa0 We know very little where it counts.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve seized the initiative.\\xa0 Until we turn things around, we\\u2019re going to be responding, not acting.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t have time to waste, if they can just call it quits and go murder mom, dad, and themselves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAt which point the Academy can\\u2019t keep the situation under wraps,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat do you think, Sly?\\xa0 Want to slip away, see what you can do while you\\u2019re staying out of sight?\\xa0 See if you can turn things around or get the right words to the right ears?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf they\\u2019re doing headcounts, they\\u2019ll wonder where I\\u2019m at.\\xa0 Depending on how things go, that wondering might reach our puppeteer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not a no,\\u201d Jamie commented.</p>\\n<p>I smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe has at least an <em>idea</em> of who we are,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHaving you lurking could scare him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr <em>she</em> has an idea who we are,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe could scare <em>her</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon rolled his eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m just saying.\\xa0 Most teachers are female.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m only saying this doesn\\u2019t feel like a woman\\u2019s work,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWomen care about kids on a deeper level.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I thought of Lacey.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was shaking his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I try to argue, you\\u2019ll win.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll say something about the poisoner being a woman after all, and you\\u2019re faster on the draw than I am, so okay.\\xa0 I forfeit the argument.\\xa0 You\\u2019re right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon frowned, clearly annoyed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEither way, I\\u2019m thinking we don\\u2019t want to scare him.\\xa0 Or her,\\u201d I said, adding that last bit for Jamie\\u2019s benefit.\\xa0 I saw a slight smile on Jamie\\u2019s face at that, and a slight deepening of Gordon\\u2019s frown of annoyance, which was even better.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we assume our puppeteer is operating under fear right now, tying everything up and attempting to remove us before we can uncover him, or packing up and running, then we don\\u2019t want to push him too far.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow do we seize the initiative if you\\u2019re worried-\\u201d Jamie started.</p>\\n<p>I reached up, shushing him.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d approached a corner, and the man in the red jacket was further down the hallway.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t moving, slumped against the wall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think you need me?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>As if in response, the man in the red jacket passed gas.\\xa0 It was a long, high pitched sound.</p>\\n<p>He sighed in audible relief, patted his rear end with his hand, checking, then pulled himself away from the wall.</p>\\n<p>I took a second to admire the man\\u2019s courage before saying, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded, but he didn\\u2019t move from the base of the stairwell while Jamie and I headed toward our room.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHello, Mr. McCairn,\\u201d Jamie greeted the man.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie.\\xa0 And\\u2026 I don\\u2019t recognize this one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo your rooms, <em>stat</em>.\\xa0 I\\u2019m doing a headcount as we speak.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>You\\u2019re standing there suffering, or you\\u2019re acting, but you\\u2019re most definitely not in the midst of doing anything else</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>Still, I obeyed.</p>\\n<p>I closed the door, then immediately began studying our surroundings.\\xa0 Jamie sat on his bed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were saying?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe head back to our room, and you tell me about the faculty.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere do I start?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHeadmistress.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot a lot to say.\\xa0 She was a teacher for five years before her superior came down with a pregnancy, she took over, and she did a good enough job that she kept the job while moving from place to place.\\xa0 When Mothmont sprung up, they went looking for someone with a squeaky reputation and clean face to watch over it all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Squeaky reputation.\\xa0 That didn\\u2019t mean it was a clean reputation, but it changed the tone of things.\\xa0 Was it ambition at the heart of it?</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I searched the room, looking over the desk, opening the drawers.</p>\\n<p>Nothing of particular interest.\\xa0 Ink bottles, pens, a kit for sewing, in case we needed to mend our uniforms\\u2026</p>\\n<p>I removed the contents of the drawers, setting the items on top of the desk.\\xa0 I considered them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMcCairn?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked Jamie, when I was done considering.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEx-military.\\xa0 Does drills with the boys, looks over the boy\\u2019s dorm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPhysical education?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s all an act,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Dressing up, playing up the accent.\\xa0 They picked him because he was local, not because he was upper crust.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think he\\u2019s a consideration?\\xa0 If he\\u2019s picking off the powerful, maybe he doesn\\u2019t like being the low man on the totem pole?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m more likely to think he\\u2019s beholden to this place than an outright enemy.\\xa0 Besides, how does he control the children?\\xa0 Who else?\\xa0 Second person at the table, between McCairn and the headmistress.\\xa0 Academy-trained?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned my attention to the chests at the foot of our beds.\\xa0 I opened the lid, and then tested the weight of the lid itself.</p>\\n<p>Solid wood, three feet by two feet, give or take.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot Academy trained, no.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Returning to the desk, I claimed a pen, then set to unscrewing the hinges from the bottom portion of the chest.\\xa0 \\u201cWho is he?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMr. Percy.\\xa0 He teaches the younger years.\\xa0 Fundamentals of Academy science.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut he\\u2019s not Academy trained?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTeaches it from the books.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I pulled the lid free of the chest itself, hinges dangling.\\xa0 I set it aside.\\xa0 \\u201cHelp.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie was on his feet.\\xa0 Not a question as to <em>why</em>.\\xa0 He just obeyed.</p>\\n<p>Together, we moved the chest to the base of the door.\\xa0 The entire thing must have weighed six or so stone.\\xa0 A piece of furniture unto itself.</p>\\n<p>I upended the chest, so the side was facing up, and then dragged the lid over.\\xa0 I climbed up onto the chest so my eyes were level with the top of the door, and the two of us managed to raise the chest\\u2019s lid up to the same level, resting the end of the lid near where my toes were.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGet the chair?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd a book or something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He did.\\xa0 Standing on the chair, he had a little less height than I did, but he was able to help me, lifting the lid higher.\\xa0 When it got too high for Jamie to really help, he used the book for extra leverage, while I used my other hand to steady it.</p>\\n<p>In the process, we managed to get the entire thing up so it rested on the top of the doorframe, flush against the wall.</p>\\n<p>With one hand up to keep it from falling down on top of us, I took the book from Jamie and adjusted the bend of the hinge, until it bent at a right angle.</p>\\n<p>I opened the door a crack, peered through to make sure the hallway was empty, then gave the hinge a solid <em>whack</em> with the book.</p>\\n<p>The hinge punched into the wall.</p>\\n<p>Tentatively, I let go.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have the oddest sense for decorations,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI left the screws on the corner of the bed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, sure.\\u201d\\xa0 Jamie went to fetch the screws.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf he\\u2019s had access to the books, he could know something.\\xa0 Percy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe could,\\u201d Jamie agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cBut if he was <em>this</em> good, why wouldn\\u2019t he be employed by the Academy already?\\xa0 He\\u2019d rather be headmaster?\\xa0 It\\u2019s weak.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 Taking the first screw from Jamie, I used the pen to set it in place, just enough to be firmly in the wood, still sticking out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStrangest sense for decoration,\\u201d Jamie observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShut up, and give me a screw,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie obliged.</p>\\n<p>It took only a minute to get the screws into place.\\xa0 Set randomly, as my reach allowed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSewing kit?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd while I work with that, unlace your shoes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re aware this is going to make a racket when it comes down?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m aware,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut Gordon was right.\\xa0 It makes sense for me to be out and about\\u2026 except I don\\u2019t like leaving you defenseless.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m better in a brawl than you are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t say that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s true.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s depressing, because you still suck at it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy worry is that they won\\u2019t give you a chance to scrap with them.\\xa0 If the situation calls for it, this will at least give them pause.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I put the first pin\\u2019s point against the wood, then pressed the cover of the book against it until it stuck out.\\xa0 I started with the second pin.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLaces done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBoth shoes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He handed them to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLie down, get a wink or two,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll wait around until they\\u2019re done the headcount, then I\\u2019ll disappear.\\xa0 You leave me a signal if it\\u2019s unsafe for me to return?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">No plan went a hundred percent smoothly.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Sitting in the dark of the room, I could feel the lingering headache from my appointment.\\xa0 The lights were off, the building was almost silent, but for the sounds of people continuing to be ill.\\xa0 There was nothing to distract me from my own pain.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The shoelaces hung limp in my hand.\\xa0 With my own shoelaces attached, they strung up to the board I\\u2019d fixed above the wall.\\xa0 It bristled with collected screws, needles, broken pen tips, and a few choice pieces of glass.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The limited length of the shoelaces had meant I\\u2019d had to sit on the corner of Jamie\\u2019s bed or the chair, and even though sitting on the bed meant getting periodically kicked as Jamie tossed and turned under his covers, it was far more comfortable than the hard wooden chair.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I didn\\u2019t mind the company, even if the company was asleep.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My trap here wouldn\\u2019t kill, but killing wasn\\u2019t the aim.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Couldn\\u2019t interrogate the dead.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Every few minutes, I\\u2019d hear someone being sick or crying out, the rustle of running footsteps, or smell rank aromas from nearby rooms.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The trick was to connect the sounds.\\xa0 I drew a mental picture, tying it all together, sequences of events.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was when I heard a murmured conversation and the rustle of footsteps without any sound of distress to precede it that I tensed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Young voices.</p>\\n<p>Moving the shoelaces to one hand, I slid back reaching as far as I could, and put my fingers over Jamie\\u2019s mouth.</p>\\n<p>He was awake in an instant.\\xa0 I felt his hot breath between my fingers.</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>Floorboards creaked.\\xa0 The doorknob rattled.</p>\\n<p>The light from the corridor outside was blinding as the door yawned open.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey,\\u201d Ed said.\\xa0 I could only barely make out his smile.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes widened.</p>\\n<p>Three people.\\xa0 Ed and his buds.\\xa0 Boys who hadn\\u2019t sat at the table with me, Gordon, and the rest of us.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d collected their food around the same time Gordon had, as part of Gordon\\u2019s pack, even if they weren\\u2019t feeling too kindly toward my orphan brother.</p>\\n<p>I considered all the options, then sighed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEd,\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know the sort of mess you\\u2019re getting yourself stuck into.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He approached me, and I felt a kind of resignation as I let the shoelace slip from my slack fingers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShut it,\\u201d Ed said.\\xa0 \\u201cStay put, don\\u2019t make a fuss.\\xa0 Our business is with Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s <em>Gordon</em> going to think?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 But it wasn\\u2019t really an <em>ask</em>.\\xa0 More a statement, to Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon\\u2019s got his head up his ass,\\u201d Ed said.\\xa0 \\u201cNow keep your voice down.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t bother calling for help.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve got someone keeping McCairn busy upstairs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I bet</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>He grabbed me, and he hauled me up.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t try putting up a fight.\\xa0 It would have been useless, and I hoped they\\u2019d get sloppy and give me a chance to surprise them.</p>\\n<p>With his buddies, he marched me forward, glancing this way, then that, before forcing me over toward the stairs.</p>\\n<p>We were half a flight down before I heard Jamie\\u2019s running footsteps above, going up to talk to Gordon.</p>\\n<p>I hoped to hell they\\u2019d be able to <em>find</em> me in time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019re doing,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know well enough.\\xa0 You\\u2019re an <em>ass</em>, Sylvester, and you made enemies.\\xa0 Now it\\u2019s catching up with you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I decided to keep my mouth shut.</p>\\n<p>The descent continued until we reached the first floor, then continued down another flight.</p>\\n<p>Once we were at the bottom, I could feel the heat in the air.\\xa0 The area was barely lit, the lighting buzzing audibly, flickering now and again, threatening to plunge us into darkness.</p>\\n<p>The boys opened a door.</p>\\n<p>There were no lightbulbs, but a very large furnace blazed, casting irregular orange flames throughout the room, while leaving much of the rest in darkness.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d I guessed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot it in one,\\u201d she said, from the gloom.</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ve been paying a lot of attention to me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been paying enough,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>She leaned forward.\\xa0 The light from the fire flickered over her face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019d you tell them?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 I jerked my head to one side.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe truth.\\xa0 That you insulted me.\\xa0 A bigger boy beating you up, you can use that.\\xa0 Get pity from girls, from my friends.\\xa0 But if a <em>girl</em> beat you up?\\xa0 You\\u2019d never live it down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe truth, huh?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you disagree with my version of events?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I considered.</p>\\n<p>I sighed.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, I suppose not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Not if it meant that she\\u2019d clean up Ed and his cronies while dealing with me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause I really wondered if you were that type of person.\\xa0 If you were that much of a scoundrel.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not denying that I\\u2019m a scoundrel.\\xa0 I do have to wonder what <em>you</em> are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat, Sylvester, would be <em>telling,</em>\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you going to start fighting yet?\\u201d Ed asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThe little ass gets a whupping from me, and goes straight back to cozying up to your friends, disrespecting them, disrespecting <em>you</em>.\\xa0 I want to hear a proper apology from his lips.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not really the apology type,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat!\\u201d\\xa0 Ed said, \\u201cRight there.\\xa0 I want you to make it so I never have to hear him say anything like that ever again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot until you\\u2019re gone,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh?\\xa0 I want to <em>see.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA girl has her modesty,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s <em>bull</em>,\\u201d Ed said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe went out after curfew and brought him here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll make you a bet,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf he turns up at school tomorrow, I\\u2019ll give you my company for an entire day.\\xa0 We can go out on the town over the weekend.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s leaving school tomorrow,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe trouble with being a little grease-stain, Sylvester, is that your words lose their power.\\xa0 Anything you say comes out sounding like a lie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou really <em>have</em> been paying attention,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne day for each of us,\\u201d Ed said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne day for each of you, or he\\u2019s so embarrassed he never turns up again,\\u201d Mary said, her voice soft.\\xa0 \\u201cWin-win.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d Ed said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo me a favor, though?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHis friends are probably hunting for him.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a stash of cards and dirty books in the kitchen, behind the shelves by the stove.\\xa0 Duck over there, hang out for a while before going back to your room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor real?\\u201d Ed asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor real.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve seen the cook boys goggling over it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I hung my head.</p>\\n<p>Ed\\u2019s group wasted no time.\\xa0 I could hear the door shut behind me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re good,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I heard a <em>click</em>.</p>\\n<p>I recognized it as the sound of a gun lever.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re very good,\\u201d I said, raising my arms.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI saw your showing against Ed.\\xa0 There\\u2019s no way you\\u2019re <em>that</em> bad in a scrap.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a show.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt really isn\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to assume you\\u2019re lying and stay comfortably at a safe distance,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to tell me about your friends.\\xa0 Share what you know.\\xa0 In exchange, I\\u2019ll be merciful.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMerciful?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll shoot you properly, once in the head, once in the chest.\\xa0 Then I haul you over and push you into the furnace before taking my leave.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe alternative being?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI take your legs out from under you, then hold you up to slow cook you while you\\u2019re alive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes were adjusting to the gloom.\\xa0 I could see the look in her eyes.</p>\\n<p>She totally would.</p>\\n<p>I exhaled slowly.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/03/28/taking-root-1-8/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>\\u201cCatch,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Something flew at me.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t see it in the darkness, and it bounced off the door by my head.</p>\\n<p>I figured out where it had bounced off to and collected it.\\xa0 I felt it rather than looking at it.\\xa0 A key.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWithout turning around, lock the door.\\xa0 If it opens or if you try anything funny, I shoot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I did as instructed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was a little too fast,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cStand with your back to the door.\\xa0 Try the knob.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I did.\\xa0 I turned the knob to the side, tugged on the door, turned the knob all the way to the other side, and then tugged on it again.\\xa0 The door rattled against the frame.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI stand corrected,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cToss me the key.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I did.</p>\\n<p>Unlike me, she did manage to catch it, but she had the benefit of the light from the furnace.\\xa0 She held it up to the light, examining it.</p>\\n<p>While she wasn\\u2019t looking directly at me, I glanced around the room.\\xa0 There was a workbench with tools on the far end of the room, and she sat on the corner of it, legs dangling and not reaching the ground.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t wearing her uniform, but a sweater, cloak and hood, and a skirt with stockings and boots.\\xa0 The gun was in her lap, pointed at me, and other weapons sat within arm\\u2019s reach.\\xa0 A hatchet, hammer, and the knife she probably planned to use if it came down to it.</p>\\n<p>By contrast, there was nothing of substance near me.\\xa0 I was uncomfortably close to the furnace, but the door didn\\u2019t quite face me, so I got the heat without the benefit of the light that streaked across the room in lines.\\xa0 The space around the furnace was kept clear, so fire wouldn\\u2019t catch.\\xa0 A coal-operated monstrosity of a thing.\\xa0 There was a pile of the fuel in the corner, a sliding door on the chute where the coal was deposited.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d voiced our suspicions aloud, that they would strike at us and then disappear to finish their missions.\\xa0 I had a sense of what her escape route was.</p>\\n<p>I started to slide to the floor.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 \\u201cStop.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stopped halfway, legs bent, back flat against the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was sitting down,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t trust anything you do.\\xa0 Certainly not this,\\u201d she told me.\\xa0 The way she phrased <em>certainly</em> was good.\\xa0 Very proper, enunciated like a girl raised by the best teachers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve made it clear that I\\u2019m going to die,\\u201d I said, holding my position.\\xa0 \\u201cI didn\\u2019t expect it this soon, but I\\u2019ve always figured it was going to happen.\\xa0 If there\\u2019s a chance I get to die sitting down, just after an interesting conversation, I consider it a pretty good end.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She moved her head, and the light from the fire danced across her face with the motion.\\xa0 \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t a conversation.\\xa0 It\\u2019s an interrogation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow I\\u2019m the one who stands corrected.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I thought I saw her expression change.\\xa0 A frown.</p>\\n<p>Had she caught me mirroring her?\\xa0 Was she aware of what mirroring was?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMay I sit?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFeet apart, hands where I can see them,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I obeyed on both fronts, but I didn\\u2019t drop to the floor.\\xa0 \\u201cBut can I sit?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was implied.\\xa0 With your back to the door, please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cImplications are dangerous when you have a pistol pointed at you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I slid the rest of the way down, keeping my hands up.\\xa0 I rested my wrists on my knees, palms toward her, fingers spread.</p>\\n<p>I took a second, rolling my shoulders.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t say or do anything.\\xa0 She remained in the shadows.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m stiff,\\u201d I commented.\\xa0 \\u201cI just spent three hours or so sitting on the end of a bed.\\xa0 I had a trap rigged, was going to pull it down on top of anyone who came in through the door.\\xa0 Except it turned out to be Ed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe was in one piece,\\u201d Mary observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor the same reason I didn\\u2019t tell him what you really were.\\xa0 Doesn\\u2019t serve a point, only gets him killed.\\xa0 If it works somehow, I\\u2019m still up shit creek.\\xa0 Cat out of the bag.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re very calm, Sylvester,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 A sudden change of subject.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy is that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike I said, I\\u2019m not too surprised I might die.\\xa0 You know, about a week ago-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo stalling for time,\\u201d she told me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s relevant, I promise,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Several seconds passed without a word from her.\\xa0 I started up again, \\u201cAbout a week ago, Professor Hayle from the Academy\\u2019s neurology department gave me a ride to the Academy.\\xa0 Do you know why?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep going, Sylvester,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t ask me questions to try and squeeze details from me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you were really merciful, you\\u2019d tell me.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a kind of torture, making me go to my grave without all of the answers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m only offering mercy because it\\u2019s the only thing I\\u2019m willing to give you in exchange for information,\\u201d Mary told me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou were saying?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was hurt.\\xa0 I got myself hurt on purpose, contrived to be in Professor Hayle\\u2019s coach and get him out of the coach, so I could take a peek at his files.\\xa0 On me, on Gordon, on Helen, Jamie, Lillian, and Evette.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Nothing in her expression or body language changed.</p>\\n<p>Was she ignorant?\\xa0 Did she not know that that wasn\\u2019t the real composition of the group?\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t have particulars?\\xa0 Or was she very good at hiding her tells?</p>\\n<p>I had to assume she was competent, and couldn\\u2019t push my luck without getting a bullet in the leg for my trouble.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was a lot of trouble, but there was a reason I went that far.\\xa0 I needed to find out what they weren\\u2019t telling us.\\xa0 I wanted to find out how long they expected us to last.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLast?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn terms of life expectancy.\\xa0 Or project expectancy.\\xa0 There\\u2019s more glory in breaking new ground than there is in refining someone else\\u2019s work, and the entire setup of the Academy is all about innovation more than doing good work.\\xa0 We\\u2019re a casualty of that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou and the others,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>We</em>, Mary,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I angled my head down until the angle of the light from the fire was enough to be especially bright in my eyes.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t see Mary as well, but I knew that she\\u2019d see the reflection.\\xa0 \\u201cYou too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not talking about me,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cGo on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I moved my head back, shrugging.\\xa0 \\u201cMost of us weren\\u2019t going to live to see twenty.\\xa0 Barring outside intervention.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My hands moved to indicate her, the outside intervention in question.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy concern isn\\u2019t with your life expectancy.\\xa0 I know exactly when you\\u2019re going to die.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI haven\\u2019t even told the others the numbers,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cPromised Gordon I would fill him in later, but the opportunity never came up.\\xa0 How do you tell someone-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Mary said, unamused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 New projects.\\xa0 You know how the departments portioned out cash for various measures?\\xa0 <em>We</em> got funding as a special project.\\xa0 Got it better than some.\\xa0 Six individual cases, each managed with an entirely different approach.\\xa0 If you want to know what you\\u2019re up against, that\\u2019s it.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t like Professor Hayle, but he gave us money, and he tried for the gamble.\\xa0 Longer-term approach than some of the other special projects, and with less than twenty years before most of us<em> expire</em>, that\\u2019s saying something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDetails.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are some big names on the other projects.\\xa0 Do you know Doctor Ibott?\\xa0 Of course you know Ibott.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDetails about <em>you</em>, and your group.\\xa0 Please don\\u2019t test me, Sylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHayle has been fighting to keep his department afloat, while others get regular injections of cash to keep innovating.\\xa0 He gets a lot of criticism because in this age of innovation and immediate results, we\\u2019re taking too long to show anything <em>demonstrable</em>.\\xa0 Their word, demonstrable.\\xa0 If you pronounce it right, you could fit \\u2018monster\\u2019 in there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled, while Mary didn\\u2019t look amused in the slightest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re meant to develop into something monstrous over time.\\xa0 Most of us.\\xa0 Each member of the group with a role, a defined identity, and a specific set of skills, crafted using entirely different means.\\xa0 What you\\u2019re dealing with\\u2026 we\\u2019re <em>good</em>, but we\\u2019re not there yet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDefined identities,\\u201d Mary echoed me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou called yourself a villain, back in the dining room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m the black sheep, or the black lamb<em>, Mary.</em>\\xa0 Gordon is the multi-talented hero, Helen the actress, Jamie the bookworm and record keeper, Evette is the problem solver who steps out from the background to deliver answer and solution in one fell stroke, and Lillian\\xa0is a student on the verge of becoming the teacher, eventually to become <em>master</em>, surpassing professors in her mastery of the Academy science.\\xa0 Me? \\xa0I\\u2019m only the bastard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Were the sharp contrasts between light and shadow playing tricks on my eyes, or had Mary\\u2019s expression changed?</p>\\n<p><em>Sorry, Evette.\\xa0 I hope it\\u2019s some consolation that you\\u2019re here with us in this sense, if nothing else.\\xa0 A phantom enemy they have no details on.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was smart of you to come after me first.\\xa0 Go for the weak link.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a good instinct you have.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething tells me you aren\\u2019t a weak link, Sylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re opposites, aren\\u2019t we?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOpposites?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m supposed to cover the gaps for the others.\\xa0 You\\u2026 you\\u2019re very specialized.\\xa0 You were prepared for one task.\\xa0 Anything else is peripheral.\\xa0 I\\u2019m built to be part of a composite whole.\\xa0 You\\u2026 you\\u2019ve got the boys, but you don\\u2019t <em>have</em> them.\\xa0 There\\u2019s no support.\\xa0 You\\u2019re among kindred but you\\u2019re alone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes were adjusting to the gloom.\\xa0 I could see how she wasn\\u2019t moving.\\xa0 Both hands held the pistol.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t move a hair.\\xa0 Only the licks of fire from the furnace illuminated anything.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t know me,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>This far into our dialogue, I had a sense of her.\\xa0 Before, I might have had to guess.\\xa0 Now I was suspicious that this was a willful lack of movement.\\xa0 She was trying very hard not to give me anything.</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cI know more than you think.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t trust your\\u2026 should I call them fellow experiments?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think you\\u2019re taking your own experiences and transplanting your experiences onto me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you?\\xa0 If you think I don\\u2019t trust the others with my life, you couldn\\u2019t be more wrong,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I clenched my hands, kneading the upper palms with my fingers to crack them, knowing full well that she was on the alert, that it would distract and force her to divide her focus between watching and listening.\\xa0 \\u201cYou, on the other hand, are paranoid.\\xa0 Exceedingly careful.\\xa0 Locking the door, taking the extra measures you are, keeping more than enough weapons in arm\\u2019s reach.\\xa0 You made the boys a part of your plan, but you don\\u2019t trust them to have your back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou keep saying that.\\xa0 \\u2018The boys\\u2019.\\xa0 I know you\\u2019re trying to make me let something slip.\\xa0 Keep trying and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Bull,</em>\\u201d I cut her off.\\xa0 \\u201cYou want to know how we operate?\\xa0 This is part of it.\\xa0 Every single thing you do, even <em>this</em>?\\xa0 We can use it.\\xa0 We can pick it apart and unravel it.\\xa0 Every action you take, you tip your hand in one way or another.\\xa0 There\\u2019s no other girl.\\xa0 The boys were a group.\\xa0 Ed said they were distracting whoever was walking the halls.\\xa0 They, <em>plural</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEd\\u2019s friends, you mean?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.\\xa0 \\u201cEd and his closest buddies didn\\u2019t sit with us at dinner.\\xa0 The rest like Gordon enough they wouldn\\u2019t pull something like that.\\xa0 It was your fellow experiments.\\xa0 The boys.\\xa0 They operate as a group.\\xa0 But while they shared the task of distracting the man, you have nobody else with you.\\xa0 Dealing with unknown quantities, you could have had another girl there with you, standing in the shadow, ready to use the same escape route.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gestured toward the closed chute beside her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou showed yourself, acting the individual, taking point.\\xa0\\xa0You showed off while doing it, that line about enjoying our meals.\\xa0 That tells me you did it voluntarily, to stand out.\\xa0 There\\u2019s no other girl in this narrative.\\xa0 You stand alone, Mary Elizabeth Coburn, and you know it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She looked down at the gun.\\xa0 \\u201cI feel like shooting you now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat reminds me, just in case you feel like shooting me all of a sudden.\\xa0 When you do it, can you do me a favor?\\xa0 Shoot me in the heart?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She looked up at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI always thought my head would be what went first.\\xa0 I\\u2019d kind of like to stick it to fate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot knowing what you are, I\\u2019m not sure I\\u2019m willing to risk it.\\xa0 For all I know, you\\u2019re a human they grew in a jar.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m real.\\xa0 Woman-born,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAn adjustment made after the fact, so my head works in a slightly different way.\\xa0 A shot to the heart will kill me.\\xa0 But maybe one to the heart, watch me die, then finish me off with one to the head?\\xa0 As one experiment to another, it would be very much appreciated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a fatalistic little shit, aren\\u2019t you?\\xa0 That\\u2019s really not an act, huh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI said we were opposites, before.\\xa0 Even our positions here make for a pretty good contrast.\\xa0 You up high, armed to the teeth.\\xa0 Me down below.\\xa0 Roasting.\\xa0 My weakness is my head.\\xa0 Yours-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt strikes me,\\u201d she said, interrupting me, affecting an arch tone of surprise, \\u201cthat I\\u2019m sitting here, and it truly feels like <em>I\\u2019m</em> the one being interrogated.\\xa0 For the past minute or two we\\u2019ve barely talked about you in any meaningful capacity.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That was the kind of epiphany that was punctuated by the pull of a trigger.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d hoped to lead into it more, but\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I were him, I would have told you that you were special,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t pull the trigger.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to say anything,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I even dropped my head down to look at the floor, so she didn\\u2019t have to worry about me studying her in the darkness.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m just going to talk out loud.\\xa0 You\\u2019re alone.\\xa0 You\\u2019re smart enough and you have free reign enough that you <em>have</em> to know what happened to your predecessors.\\xa0 Word gets around a school like this, and you\\u2019ve shown you can connect the dots.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I continued, \\u201cThat leaves a question.\\xa0 How does he keep you in line?\\xa0 How does he convince you that <em>you\\u2019re</em> safe, that you won\\u2019t go the same way the others did?\\xa0 My line of thinking is that he tells you that out of all the tries, <em>you</em> worked.\\xa0 This on top of whatever story he\\u2019s concocted, that he\\u2019s equipped you to kill your parents and that nobody will suspect you, the orphan.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll get the inheritance and everything ends happily ever after.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Still no bullet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou believed him.\\xa0 You still do, because you have no other choice but to face the grim reality.\\xa0 That your lifespan is measured in <em>hours</em>.\\xa0 He tells you to do what you can to deal with <em>us</em>, as discreetly as possible, and then go deal with your parents.\\xa0 The emetics would be his idea, but this thing with getting me in this room and having the furnace going, it\\u2019s all very well done, you put effort into it.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll put effort into dealing with your parents\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I paused.</p>\\n<p><em>You put the effort in because you think he\\u2019ll praise you.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll be his triumph.\\xa0 His girl.\\xa0 You love him, as a parental figure or as anyone at the start of their journey to adulthood can be infatuated with an adult.</em></p>\\n<p><em>We\\u2019re opposites in that respect too.\\xa0 You love your creator</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026And you\\u2019ll end up exactly like the others, unable to move while the family home burns up around you,\\u201d I said, instead.\\xa0 Attacking her relationship with the puppeteer <em>would</em> get me shot.\\xa0 I raised my head to look at her.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t quite make out her face in the gloom.\\xa0 \\u201cHow does he do it, Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought I didn\\u2019t have to say anything,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Her words were empty of inflection, like Helen\\u2019s sometimes was.</p>\\n<p><em>I got it wrong?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m trying to <em>help you</em>, you stupid little <em>twit</em>!\\u201d I said, clenching my hands again.\\xa0 \\u201cHe did something to make you sharper, to put ideas in your head, so that you\\u2019d walk the path he drew out in front of you.\\xa0 I want to know so I can stop you from walking off the cliff that\\u2019s waiting at the end!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou seem to be forgetting something, Sylvester,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She hopped down from the edge of the workbench, and used a free hand to smooth out her dress and fix her cloak at the shoulder, the pistol never leaving me.\\xa0 \\u201cDid you think that if you kept saying \\u2018oh, I\\u2019m going to die, I\\u2019m going to die, you\\u2019re going to kill me\\u2019 like it didn\\u2019t matter, getting me to let my guard down, that you could turn it around?\\xa0 Start talking like I\\u2019m going to let you live and change my mind on that level?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, actually, you\\u2019re quite wrong on that count,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI really didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 But it\\u2019s really kind of telling that you thought that.\\xa0 Did you get that idea from him?\\xa0 Is that how he thinks, and the sort of thing he pays attention to?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She shook her head.</p>\\n<p>But it wasn\\u2019t a shake of negation.</p>\\n<p>Mary was losing her faith.\\xa0 If there was anything I could do to keep her from stepping closer to me and pulling that trigger, it was giving her something to hold on to.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re right that I\\u2019ve been interrogating you.\\xa0 Thinking aloud and watching your reactions.\\xa0 I can tell that you care about him, and you wanted to do this, right here, for him.\\xa0 I can give you what you want.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I can tell that you care about him</em>.\\xa0 If she was human at her core, finally having a confidant for feelings that had been under lock and key had to count for something.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA bullet in your head?\\xa0 A clean disposal?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 \\u201cA job well done?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t tell you where Evette is.\\xa0 But I can tell you who to watch out for.\\xa0 You can tell him, and he\\u2019ll be pleased.\\xa0 With you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She switched to a two-handed grip, aiming at my chest.</p>\\n<p>All show.</p>\\n<p>No way she\\u2019d shoot, now.</p>\\n<p>I decided to push my luck further.\\xa0 \\u201cI have a condition.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She let out a titter of a laugh.\\xa0 Cultured through and through.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t go home.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t go visit your parents.\\xa0 If I\\u2019m right, then you\\u2019ll find that all the work the puppeteer has done has made it automatic.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll see their faces and all at once you\\u2019ll be like a stitched, going through the motions with a very limited capacity, but all of the <em>sharpness</em> the puppeteer gave you.\\xa0 Execute mom, execute dad, and then burn up yourself with all the rest of the evidence.\\xa0 If I\\u2019m wrong, you lose nothing.\\xa0 You can take the information I gave you, you can communicate the details to the puppeteer, get a rare compliment that means <em>ever so much</em> to you, and then go kill your parents another day.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDelaying gives you a window of opportunity to act against us.\\xa0 If I communicate with him, that\\u2019s a chance for you to identify him.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not that easily manipulated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo you aren\\u2019t,\\u201d I agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you\\u2019re wrong about my motivations.\\xa0 Years ago, back at the beginning of my becoming <em>Sylvester,</em> I stole my file.\\xa0 I found out about the expiration dates.\\xa0 That it was so common a thing that it\\u2019s a pre-typed line in the documents that go with being an experiment.\\xa0 I decided that I\\u2019d dedicate myself to helping the others.\\xa0 If I can keep them alive longer, or support them, I\\u2019ll do that.\\xa0 But I think my best bet is to prove that Professor Hayle\\u2019s secret project was a success.\\xa0 Because then they\\u2019ll want to keep us alive, they\\u2019ll dedicate more to us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat does that have to do with this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re similar to the others.\\xa0 To <em>me</em>, as much as I talk about us being opposites.\\xa0 I want to keep you alive because you\\u2019re <em>kindred</em>.<em>\\xa0 </em>Not <em>kin</em>, but a bird of the same feather.\\xa0 Your success is our success, even if we\\u2019re on opposite sides.\\xa0 Even the puppeteer\\u2019s success is, in a way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m starting to regret letting you talk at all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause I hit the mark?\\u201d I asked, hopeful.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause that\\u2019s the biggest load of goatshit I\\u2019ve ever heard,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>With the back of my head against the door, I could hear the sound of footsteps.\\xa0 Heavier, running.</p>\\n<p><em>No!</em> I thought, even as I kept my expression still.</p>\\n<p><em>Not now,</em> I thought.\\xa0 <em>You damn idiot.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll force her hand and get me shot</em>.</p>\\n<p>The footsteps receded.\\xa0 Going the wrong direction.\\xa0 I resisted the urge to sigh in relief.</p>\\n<p>I was now forced to rush it.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t keep stringing her along, offering her bait to keep her from pulling the trigger.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon is the one you should watch out for.\\xa0 Investigating?\\xa0 He\\u2019s still learning.\\xa0 Acting, disguise, infiltration?\\xa0 He\\u2019s okay at the third, in terms of sheer agility and ability to get places, but the rest are points he needs to shore up.\\xa0 But when they figure out who the puppeteer is, and they just about <em>have</em>, it\\u2019s Gordon who will handle the man.\\xa0 You can tell the puppeteer that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAssuming I tell him anything.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>You have to</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>Evette is too dangerous as an unknown</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAssuming you tell him anything, yeah,\\u201d I agreed.</p>\\n<p>The footsteps resumed.\\xa0 There was a murmur of voice.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was too fast, and the others were at the bottom of the stairs.</p>\\n<p><em>For gods sake, at least be quiet</em>.</p>\\n<p>I heard a statement, quick and quieter than the ones prior.\\xa0 Then silence.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d seen the light from the furnace under the door, or they\\u2019d heard something.</p>\\n<p>Now they were coming.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo what you have to,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut know that whatever you do, the moment you go home to fulfill your last order, you\\u2019ll be a statistic to the puppeteer, and nothing more.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll revert to the instructions he gave you, and in the midst of it, you\\u2019ll be completely and utterly alone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The expression in her face went cold.\\xa0 Angry.\\xa0 A killer\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 I believed her, that she didn\\u2019t have an iota of mercy in her when it really came down to it.\\xa0 Her world had been reduced to her and her creator.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn the meantime, Mary, keep in mind that there are others like you out there.\\xa0 Including me, at least until you pull that trigger.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The best way to lie was to believe the lie.\\xa0 Not that I was lying, but the idea connected to the next.</p>\\n<p>The best way to surprise someone was to be surprised as well.</p>\\n<p>The door smashed into the room with a force that sent me from my seat at its base to the center of the room.</p>\\n<p>Gordon pushed aside the remnants of the door.\\xa0 It looked as though he\\u2019d dislocated his shoulder, from the way he held his arm.</p>\\n<p>Mary, holding the gun, seemed momentarily caught between finishing me off while I lay two feet from her and dealing with the boy that was half-again her size and apparently capable of throwing himself through a door.</p>\\n<p>She decided in the same instant Gordon moved.\\xa0 The pistol wheeled on him, and he threw himself between the wall and the furnace.\\xa0 The bullet flashed where it hit the edge of the furnace.</p>\\n<p>She spent five shots in total, and then aimed at me.\\xa0 I covered my face.</p>\\n<p>I heard the bullet, but didn\\u2019t feel it.</p>\\n<p>She reached to the table to seize the hatchet, and moved toward me.</p>\\n<p>Taking me hostage with a hatchet?\\xa0 She was careful enough to sharpen it.</p>\\n<p>That would be ideal, but the others wouldn\\u2019t let her do it.\\xa0 There were benefits to acting alone, I supposed.</p>\\n<p>Instead, I pointed at Gordon.</p>\\n<p>He was already emerging from behind the furnace.\\xa0 She heaved the weapon at him, an expert motion, sending handle spinning over axehead.\\xa0 He ducked back behind the furnace for cover, while the axe struck the wall right where his head had been.</p>\\n<p>She leaped over my legs on her way to the coal chute, throwing the door open.</p>\\n<p>Gordon moved to follow.</p>\\n<p>I heard a rasp.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNope!\\u201d I called out.\\xa0 Non-sequitur, but it was what my brain produced in the moment.</p>\\n<p>Gordon paused.</p>\\n<p>Fire appeared within the chute.</p>\\n<p>Our golden boy kicked the chute door closed before the fire could touch the pile of coal at the chute\\u2019s base.</p>\\n<p>Leaving Mary to make her well-planned escape.</p>\\n<p>I let my head sink back to rest against the floor.\\xa0 Above me, at the doorway, I could see the others standing on either side of the door, peering into the room.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did you get from her?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow are you doing, Sy?\\u201d I asked, injecting plenty of sarcasm into my voice, \\u201cHow did you do it, Sy?\\xa0 Are you okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you okay?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did you get from her?\\u201d she asked, again.</p>\\n<p>I sighed.</p>\\n<p>Gordon offered me a hand in getting to my feet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think she\\u2019s vat grown,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen pressed, the first thing that popped into her head was a person grown in a bottle.\\xa0 That\\u2019s where I\\u2019d lay my money.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVat grown?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cMade from scratch?\\xa0 No, that would be next to impossible, if they\\u2019re supposed to resemble the kids they ended up replacing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cClones.\\xa0 Possibly with implanted behaviors.\\xa0 Probably something plugged in for imprinting to their creator and a reversal of the typical love for your parents.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can work with that as a starting point,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have a lot to work with,\\u201d I said, looking down at the mark the bullet had made in the floor when she\\u2019d fired at me.</p>\\n<p>Too far away to be anything but a deliberate miss.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/03/14/taking-root-1-2/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p><em>How does it go?\\xa0 The first lesson, something even the uninitiated know.\\xa0 For life to flourish on the most basic level, it requires four elements.\\xa0 Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen.</em></p>\\n<p>We were doing fine on that count.\\xa0 The air around us was stale, but it was still oxygen.\\xa0 Water ran around and below us, flowing over our bare feet, redirected from gutters to the building\\u2019s inside.</p>\\n<p>What had once been a barn had been made into a warehouse, then abandoned partway through a third set of changes.\\xa0 A floor of old wooden slats reached only halfway down the length of the old building, what had once been a hayloft.\\xa0 If we stood on the edge, we could look down at the floor below to see uneven floorboards on top of compacted dirt.\\xa0 The original barn\\u2019s door was still there, mounted on rollers.\\xa0 I leaned over to get a better look.\\xa0 I could see a table, some scattered papers, books, and a blackboard.\\xa0 The only light was that which came in through windows.\\xa0 A scattered set placed on the upper floor, and more well above head height on the lower one.</p>\\n<p>Aside from the four of us, one other thing occupied the hayloft.\\xa0 It was hard to make out in the dim light that filtered in through the window, like an eel in dark water, and if it weren\\u2019t for the fact that we\\u2019d seen it approach, we might not have noticed it at all.\\xa0 Sleek, four-legged, and tall enough I couldn\\u2019t have reached its shoulder if I stood on my toes, it was wound around the pillar as a snake might be.\\xa0 Unlike a snake, though, it had four long limbs, each with four long digits, tipped with claws.\\xa0 Head flowed into neck, which flowed into shoulder and body without a without prominent ridge, bump, bone or muscle to interrupt the sequence.</p>\\n<p>It uncoiled, setting a claw on the floor, and the old floorboards didn\\u2019t elicit an audible creak.\\xa0 Large as it was, it managed to distribute weight too evenly, and used its tail to suspend some of its weight.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t walk, but <em>slinked</em>, each foot falling in front of the last as it passed within three feet of us.\\xa0 Its wide mouth parted, showing just a hint of narrow white teeth.</p>\\n<p>There was no cover, nothing to hide us from it.</p>\\n<p>I saw its nostrils flare.\\xa0 It opened its mouth to taste the air with a flick of a thin tongue.</p>\\n<p>The way things looked, we were very close to doing the opposite of \\u2018flourishing\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>It was hard to put into words, but my thoughts connected with that thought, and it was <em>funny.</em></p>\\n<p>I grinned, and flakes of wax fell from my face at the movement.\\xa0 I watched the thing continue onward, toward the back of the hayloft, head turning as it sniffed the surroundings.\\xa0 It unwound its long tail from the wooden pillar that held up the one end of the overhanging hayloft, and it moved with a slow carefulness.</p>\\n<p>I stared at its eye, and saw how it didn\\u2019t move as the head swept from one side to the next, the slit of the iris barely changing in response as the faint light from the window swept over its head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s blind,\\u201d I whispered.</p>\\n<p>The movements of the creature came to a halt.\\xa0 It froze, nostrils wide.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, just to my left, put out a hand, covering my mouth.\\xa0 He was tense, lines on his neck standing out.\\xa0 Trying to put on a brave face, as our leader.\\xa0 Gordon, strong, handsome, likeable, talented.\\xa0 A veneer covered his face, as it did all of us, almost clear, cracked and white at the corners of his lips where he\\u2019d changed his expression, coming away in flakes at his hairline, where his hair was covered by the same substance.</p>\\n<p>The creature turned, and as it did its tail moved around until it touched the outside edge of the makeshift gutter that we were all standing in, fine emerald scales rasping against wood.</p>\\n<p>When Gordon whispered his response, I could barely hear him utter, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not<em> deaf</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, and he pulled his hand away.</p>\\n<p>I had a glimpse of the girls.\\xa0 Helen and Lillian.\\xa0 As different as night and day.\\xa0 Lillian was bent over, hood up and over her head, hiding her face, hands clutching the straps of her bag, white knuckled.\\xa0 Terrified, and rightly so.\\xa0 The coating on her face was flaking badly.</p>\\n<p>In contrast, Helen\\u2019s face didn\\u2019t betray a flicker of emotion.\\xa0 Her golden hair, normally well cared for, cultivated into tight rolls, was damp and falling out of place.\\xa0 Water ran down her face, splashing in through the side of the window where the makeshift gutter came in, and the droplets didn\\u2019t provoke one flinch or batted eyelash.\\xa0 She could have been a statue, and she\\u2019d kept her face still enough that the wax that covered it hadn\\u2019t broken, which only helped the effect.</p>\\n<p>Still and silent, we watched as the creature moved to the far corner of the hayloft.</p>\\n<p>It snapped, and the four curved fangs were the only ones that were any wider than a pencil, visible for only an instant before the head disappeared into detritus piled in the corner.\\xa0 A furred form struggled before the creature could raise its head.\\xa0 No swallowing, per se.\\xa0 Gravity did the work, as teeth parted and the prey fell down its long throat.</p>\\n<p>A second bite let it collect another, small and young enough it couldn\\u2019t even struggle.\\xa0 Tiny morsels.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKitties,\\u201d Lillian whispered, horror overtaking fear in her expression.</p>\\n<p><em>Mama kitty shouldn\\u2019t have had her babies in the same building as the monster,</em> I thought.\\xa0 <em>Wallace\\u2019s law at work</em>.</p>\\n<p>Gordon nudged me.\\xa0 He pointed.</p>\\n<p>The window.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>The makeshift gutter was little more than a <em>trough</em>, with little care given for the leaks here and there, and it fed into wooden barrels at the edge of the upper floor, with more channels and troughs leading into sub-chambers and tanks below.\\xa0 It had been running long enough for debris and grime to accumulate, a combination of silt and scum collecting at the very bottom to make it treacherous.\\xa0 Our progress was slow, and I had to remind myself that anything faster threatened to make <em>noise</em>, or risked a fall.</p>\\n<p>As if to follow the thought, Lillian\\u2019s foot skidded on the bottom of the trough, and she tipped forward, straight into Helen\\u2019s arms.\\xa0 The creature stopped its slow consumption of the cat\\u2019s litter.</p>\\n<p>We were frozen, waiting, while the creature sniffed the air.</p>\\n<p>It returned to its meal.</p>\\n<p>We made our way out, everyone but me flipping up their hoods to ward off the rain.\\xa0 I let the droplets fall where they would, on hair that refused to be bound down beneath a thick layer of waterproofing wax.</p>\\n<p>There was no ledge outside the window, only the real gutter.\\xa0 Bigger and more solid, if still treacherous with seasons of accumulated grime.\\xa0 The roof loomed above us, more up than over, as barn roofs were wont to be.\\xa0 Red leaves collected here and there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI stay,\\u201d Helen murmured.</p>\\n<p>There was no questioning it, no argument.\\xa0 We couldn\\u2019t afford to make the noise, and it made a degree of sense.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll go first,\\u201d I volunteered, craning my head a bit to see the way down.\\xa0 Being the sort of building it was, the barn-turned-warehouse-turned-something-else was tall, with a long way to the bottom.\\xa0 The gutter pointed groundward at the corner, fixed to the brick exterior at regular points by lengths of metal.\\xa0 It worked as a ladder, but not one that was fun to use.\\xa0 The \\u2018rungs\\u2019 were too far apart, too close to the wall.</p>\\n<p>Someone grabbed my arm.\\xa0 I thought it would be Gordon or Helen, as they had the personalities to be arm-grabbers.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou go <em>second</em>,\\u201d Lillian whispered to me.\\xa0 \\u201cI know you well enough to know that If you go before me you\\u2019ll look up my skirt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe?\\u201d I tried to sound innocent.</p>\\n<p>Gordon jabbed me.\\xa0 His expression was no-nonsense, his green eyes a steely grey beneath his hood, absorbing the colors of the clouds above.\\xa0 His mouth was a grim line.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I conceded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll take your bag,\\u201d Gordon whispered.\\xa0 Again, there was no argument.\\xa0 Lillian handed over the backpack, loaded down with tools and supplies.</p>\\n<p>She accepted Gordon\\u2019s support in getting down to the downspout, and began her slow descent.</p>\\n<p>I fidgeted.\\xa0 My eye traveled over our surroundings, buildings scattered like they\\u2019d been blown around by strong winds and planted where they lay.\\xa0 Older structures had a charm to them, simplicity and a character that came with age and gentle wear and tear.\\xa0 The oldest and the newest buildings had been shored up by strategic plant growth, branches weaving into and through damaged sections, growing to complement masonry, around bricks and supports.\\xa0 The very newest growths had a characteristic red tint to the leaves.\\xa0 The rest were dead, left to petrify.</p>\\n<p>The Academy loomed above it all, those same elements taken to an extreme.\\xa0 It had been an old collection of buildings once.\\xa0 A rush to grow and meet surging demand had led to a lot of the same haphazard growth.</p>\\n<p>It all had an <em>odor</em>.\\xa0 There were smells that became second nature, and there were smells that were ingrained in the psyche as <em>bad</em> smells.\\xa0 Ones that spoke of death, of long sickness, and of violence.\\xa0 Rendered fat, decay, and blood.\\xa0 Each were heavy on the air.</p>\\n<p>Ironic, that things so overgrown and reeking of decay were the parts of the city charged with progress.</p>\\n<p><em>You\\u2019d think the rain would wash away the smell.</em></p>\\n<p>I checked.\\xa0 Lillian had moved down one rung.\\xa0 I shifted my weight from one foot to the next, annoyed.</p>\\n<p>She wasn\\u2019t one of us.\\xa0 She was new.\\xa0 Allowances had to be made.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t the first time I had told myself any of those things.\\xa0 I\\u2019d heard it from Gordon.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t make it any less annoying.</p>\\n<p>I bent down, peering over the edge of the gutter to the road below.\\xa0 I could see the windows, the boxes further down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon hissed the words, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gripping the ledge, I swung myself over.</p>\\n<p>I let go, and enjoyed both the moment of utter terror and Lillian\\u2019s gasp of horror, before my fingers caught hold of the window frame below.</p>\\n<p>My right foot slipped on the damp windowsill, scraping peeling paint off and away before I brought it back up to the sill.\\xa0 Water and paint flakes sprayed below.</p>\\n<p>When I looked up, Gordon\\u2019s head was poking over the edge, looking down at me.</p>\\n<p>He moved his head, and I could hear him speak, very patiently, to Lillian, \\u201cKeep going.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t mind him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Peering in the window, I could see the interior, the lower floor.\\xa0 The desk, the notes on the experiment.\\xa0 Another table was heavy with lines of bottles, vials, jugs, and yet more papers, scattered.\\xa0 Rain poured down on me, tracing its way down the back of my neck, beneath my shirt.\\xa0 The waxed and waterproof cowl and short cloak had kept my shirt dry, and I shivered at the sensation.</p>\\n<p>I tested the window, and was utterly surprised to find it latched.\\xa0 I drew a key from my pocket, trying to fit it into the gap, hoping to lift the latch, but it proved too thick.</p>\\n<p>The key went back in place.\\xa0 I removed my hands from the windowsill one at a time, to dry them in my armpits and then reposition my grip.</p>\\n<p>Gripping the windowsill, I strained my body, reaching down and to the right.\\xa0 The doorframe that bounded the large sliding door was just out of reach\\u2026</p>\\n<p>Holding the windowsill with my left hand, reaching with my right leg, I touched the frame with my big toe.\\xa0 I found a grip, and I used it to better position myself.\\xa0 Fingers dug into the space between bricks, where water had worn away mortar, and I heaved myself over, using my toes and only my toes to perch on the top of the doorway.</p>\\n<p>Were it any other door, I wouldn\\u2019t have fussed, but I was still just high enough off the ground to have cause to worry.\\xa0 This had been a barn, and this door was the type that let wagons or draft horses inside.</p>\\n<p>I paused on top of the door, cleaning my hands of wet and grit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWatching you do that is making me nervous,\\u201d Lillian said, looking down at me.\\xa0 She\\u2019d progressed two more \\u2018rungs\\u2019.\\xa0 She was the shortest of us, next to me, it didn\\u2019t make it easier for her.</p>\\n<p>I flashed her a grin, and more of the waterproofing wax that I\\u2019d caked onto my face cracked.</p>\\n<p>I worked my way down to a crouch, still on top of the door, then slid down, draping my front against the door itself.\\xa0 I let myself drop the rest of the way, landing bare-footed in mud.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t get the smile off my face as I passed beneath the drain pipe, making a point of looking up at Lillian, who was making a point of her own in turn, glaring down at me, very clearly annoyed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou had an audience,\\u201d a soft voice stated.</p>\\n<p>I turned.</p>\\n<p>Amid empty crates and a door that had been taken off its hinges, jumbled together as trash and detritus, I could make out the fifth member of our contingent.\\xa0 Jamie had a book in his lap, our collected boots and shoes neatly organized around him, and he had company.\\xa0 A black-skinned boy with a hood and cloak far too large for him, tattered enough that it had probably been a hand-me-down for the last person to own it.\\xa0 His eyes were wide.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought you were keeping lookout,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe whole point of being lookout is that you tell us if there\\u2019s trouble.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs he trouble?\\u201d\\xa0 Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m no trouble,\\u201d the boy\\u2019s words flowed right off the back of Jamie\\u2019s, without a heartbeat of hesitation.\\xa0 \\u201cThe trouble is inside.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe snake thing,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou saw it?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 His eyes went wider.\\xa0 \\u201cThen you should know if you\\u2019re going to steal something, you shouldn\\u2019t steal from there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not stealing,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re just looking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The boy didn\\u2019t respond.\\xa0 He watched Lillian\\u2019s glacially slow descent.</p>\\n<p>I met Jamie\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 If it weren\\u2019t for Helen, who was a special case, I might have called Jamie the quiet one.\\xa0 He wore eyeglasses, though there were all sorts of ways to fix or replace bad eyes, and his hair was long beneath his hood.\\xa0 Not out of any style or affectation.\\xa0 He simply never liked how it looked when it was short.\\xa0 His face was narrow, his eyes large as he shifted his gaze to look from me to Lillian.\\xa0 His hands held firm to a book that sat across his knees.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStayed upstairs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A nod.</p>\\n<p>I wanted him to figure out how to deal with our bystander, given how he\\u2019d failed to warn us about the boy in the first place, but Jamie was silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s your name?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMine?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know <em>his</em>,\\u201d I said, striving to not sound as annoyed at the question as I <em>felt</em>.\\xa0 I pointed at Jamie to make myself as clear as possible.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThomas.\\xa0 My friends call me Thom.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid you hear about the crying man of Butcher\\u2019s Row?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSly,\\u201d Jamie said, suddenly paying attention to the issue.\\xa0 The name was a warning.</p>\\n<p>But Thom gave an answer, \\u201cThat stitched that went crazy.\\xa0 Remembered things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s the one.\\xa0 Do you remember Mother Hen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Thom nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cThat nurse who- the babies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He looked rather uneasy now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s right,\\u201d I said, doing my best to sound calm, reassuring.\\xa0 \\u201cThe nurse.\\xa0 <em>Yes</em>.\\xa0 Both got caught, right?\\xa0 Everything got tied up neatly?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Thom said.\\xa0 He couldn\\u2019t meet my eyes, so he focused on Lillian instead.\\xa0 \\u201cThe authorities from the Academy got them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExactly, Thom,\\u201d I said, \\u201cBut who told the authorities?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>His eyes moved.\\xa0 To me, then Jamie, to Lillian, and then the barn-turned-warehouse.</p>\\n<p>I was nodding before the word came out of his mouth.\\xa0 \\u201cYou.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re clever,\\u201d I praised him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I made the universal gesture for money, rubbing thumb against two fingers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReally?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>The gears were shifting in his head.\\xa0 Processing, calculating.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve heard things,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI bet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUseful things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t doubt it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can get money for it?\\xa0 For telling people?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you know who to tell, and how to sell it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>His expression changed, a frown.\\xa0 Disappointment.</p>\\n<p>Tick, tick, turn turn.\\xa0 The gears in his head were still moving.</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t dumb, even if he wasn\\u2019t much of an actor.\\xa0 Then again, he was only ten or so.</p>\\n<p>I could guess what he was going to ask, and I knew I might lose him if I turned him down too many times.</p>\\n<p>My mind ticked over possibilities.\\xa0 What I needed, what I had to do.</p>\\n<p>Before he could venture a question, I interrupted him.\\xa0 \\u201cYou want in?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 Now he was wary.</p>\\n<p>I reached beneath my cloak, and I fished out a coinpurse.\\xa0 Two fingers reached in, and came out fully extended, two dollars in coins pressed between the tips.</p>\\n<p>The wariness subsided.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll give you this on good faith.\\xa0 Eight whole dollars if you follow through.\\xa0 I need you to do something for me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He reached for and claimed the money without any hesitation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said you had friends?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn top of the grocer\\u2019s place. Corner of Oxbow and Halls.\\xa0 Wait there.\\xa0 Take turns keeping an eye out.\\xa0 You\\u2019re looking for a black coach, led by two stitched horses, heading toward the Academy.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll know they\\u2019re stitched because they\\u2019re wearing raincoats.\\xa0 Won\\u2019t be more than two hours\\u2019 wait.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s a rain barrel up there.\\xa0 They\\u2019re going to have to stop to wait for the way to clear before they can carry on their way.\\xa0 What you\\u2019re going to do is tip over the barrel.\\xa0 Send water off the edge of the roof, onto the horses if you can.\\xa0 Might want to prop some things up around the barrel, to make sure it happens.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He frowned a bit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTen dollars, all in all, for you and your friends, for one afternoon\\u2019s work.\\xa0 Pretty good deal.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t think you can do it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can do it,\\u201d Thom said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou sure?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can do it,\\u201d he said, voice firm.</p>\\n<p>I studied him, head to toe, taking it all in.</p>\\n<p>Reaching beneath my cloak, I collected a note from a pocket.\\xa0 I pressed it into his hands.</p>\\n<p>He looked down at the money, stunned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you don\\u2019t follow through, you won\\u2019t get a deal like this again,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThink <em>hard</em> before you try cheating me.\\xa0 A big part of what we do is find people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mute, he nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He went, running, feet splashing in puddles of water.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was about halfway down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou lied to him,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould you rather I told the truth?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to get him involved.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich leads me to ask\\u2026 what are you up to?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou weren\\u2019t just getting rid of him or making trouble.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going inside,\\u201d I said, starting for the door.\\xa0 \\u201cTell the others if they\\u2019re wondering.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not what I\\u2019m asking,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>But he didn\\u2019t move from his spot, and I was already gone.</p>\\n<p>I passed under Lillian a second time, peeking up her skirt a second time, more to needle her than out of any lingering curiosity.\\xa0 The big door was, as it turned out, locked, and I wasn\\u2019t able to bypass the big padlock any more than I could bypass the latch of the window above.\\xa0 But the door rolled on wheels, and the wheels fit in ruts, a long, shallow channel.</p>\\n<p>I headed to the end of the door opposite the lock, and I pushed the full weight of my body against it.\\xa0 The lock rattled, heavy.</p>\\n<p>I tried a bit more pressure, pushing, and the door tilted, the bottom corner closest to me rising out of the channel.\\xa0 Gripping the door, I lifted it up and away, wood scraping concrete as I created a triangular gap.</p>\\n<p>I slipped inside, my eyes immediately going to the hayloft, the upper floor.</p>\\n<p>Helen was there, sitting with one foot propped up, both hands in her lap to keep her skirt pressed down.\\xa0 Her face was still expressionless.\\xa0 Half of her attention was on me.\\xa0 Half was on the creature.\\xa0 There was a rain barrel beside her, rigged so it hung over the edge of the hayloft, collecting the water that ran in through the makeshift gutter, feeding a steady stream down into containers below.\\xa0 Runoff from those containers fed into the corner of the building.\\xa0 A drain from when the building had been a warehouse, keeping the goods dry.</p>\\n<p>I studied the papers on the desk.\\xa0 Water from one of the windows above spat down.\\xa0 Barely large enough to qualify as drops, but they dotted one paper, making ink bleed.\\xa0 Sketches of the beast.\\xa0 Notations on structure and anatomy.</p>\\n<p>One of the texts on a table beside the desk was hand-made.\\xa0 Pages had holes in them, and a cord was laced through, tying them to the heavy leather cover.\\xa0 With care, I paged through the thing.</p>\\n<p>One being, knit together from several.\\xa0 The better traits of each, all drawn together.\\xa0 References to Wollstone\\u2019s texts, to the ratios of life, and to the volumes of genetic code for Felidae and <em>Eunectes Murinus</em>.</p>\\n<p>A whole chapter on digestive enzymes.\\xa0 Diagrams of the thing\\u2019s fangs, which I had glimpsed as it devoured the mother cat, with labels for the reservoirs of venom that wasn\\u2019t true venom.\\xa0 It was enzymes, much like the ones bugs used to dissolve their meals before supping them.\\xa0 Notes suggested that the feature helped with the digestion of any and all food.</p>\\n<p>Little doubt of what this thing had been engineered for.</p>\\n<p>My finger traced the labels of glass containers, bottles and vials.\\xa0 Blood, bile, cerebral fluid\\u2026</p>\\n<p>Venom.\\xa0 I\\u2019d expected it to be green, but it was clear, in a glass container with a murky exterior, about as tall and wide as a wine bottle, though more cylindrical.</p>\\n<p>There was a noise at the door, and I took a long step to the side, toward the shadows beside one of the big wooden containers for water.</p>\\n<p>Only Lillian, followed by Gordon, passing through the gap.\\xa0 Gordon was the largest of us, and it was a particularly tight fit for him.</p>\\n<p>I continued paging through the text.</p>\\n<p>Diet.</p>\\n<p>My eye traveled down the list.\\xa0 Meal times, meal sources, meal sizes.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Pig carcass.<br/>\\nDog carcass.<br/>\\nPig carcass.<br/>\\nScavenged meal, unknown type.</em><br/>\\n<em>Pig carcass.</em><br/>\\n<em>Pig carcass.</em><br/>\\n<em>Scavenged meal, dog.</em></p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t fully grown, but it was close, and it grew fast.\\xa0 Two meals a week.</p>\\n<p>I recalled that it had eaten the cat, and then looked back at the entries.</p>\\n<p><em>Forty pounds, sixty pounds, forty pounds, est. one hundred pounds\\u2026\\xa0 </em>I noted the numbers, and tried to find the pattern between those numbers and the meals.</p>\\n<p>I moved ahead a few pages until I reached the first partial page.\\xa0 Room left for more entries.</p>\\n<p>Last meal, just over two days ago, goat carcass.\\xa0 It was hungry already.\\xa0 Quite possibly getting ready for one last growth spurt.\\xa0 The more recent meals were larger.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was crouched, peering at labels on bottles.\\xa0 He saw me looking, and tapped his nose, then pointed at the bottles</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>I tapped the book, getting his attention, and stepped away while he read the entries.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t have much of a chance to read.</p>\\n<p>There was a sound outside, violent, of things falling over.\\xa0 Chaos.</p>\\n<p>I could picture Jamie\\u2019s hiding spot, the way the door had been propped up.\\xa0 This was a warning.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Hide</em>,\\u201d Gordon whispered.</p>\\n<p><em>You don\\u2019t have to tell me</em>, I thought, but I held my tongue.</p>\\n<p>Very carefully, I closed the book.\\xa0 I shifted the angle to return it to the position it had been in.\\xa0 My eye swept over the room.</p>\\n<p>Water on the floor.\\xa0 Did it matter?</p>\\n<p>No.\\xa0 There was no time, besides.</p>\\n<p>I slipped into the shadowy crevice between the water tank and the wall.\\xa0 Gordon and Lillian were already gone.\\xa0 Helen, who had been above, watching everything, was now gone.\\xa0 No doubt hiding behind the water barrel, a step away from where she had been.</p>\\n<p>Four seconds passed before I heard the lock rattle.</p>\\n<p>The door\\u2019s wheel slammed back down into the rut as it was pulled to one side, but there was no sign of concern or suspicion.</p>\\n<p>He closed the door behind him, and the sound of something being dragged joined the sound of hard shoe soles on the wooden floor, marking his progress across his makeshift laboratory.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamned beast,\\u201d he muttered.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere are you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He made seemingly deliberate noise as he cleared a table, then dropped his burden on top of it.</p>\\n<p>I heard a grunt, his, and the smell of blood filled the air.</p>\\n<p>The amount of light in the room shifted.\\xa0 I judged it to be the beast\\u2019s bulk blocking the light from the windows above.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere you are,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>With swift strides, he crossed to the water tank I crouched beside.\\xa0 He wasted no time in dipping his hands inside, splashing water as he swished his hands inside.\\xa0 Some of the water that slopped around the top of the tank splashed down on top of me.</p>\\n<p>I was close enough to touch him.</p>\\n<p>There was a scuffle and a thud as the cat-snake creature touched ground, eager to get to its meal.\\xa0 Its creator was already at the desk, picking select vials, dabbing a bit on his wrist, then rubbing his wrists together.</p>\\n<p>I thought of Gordon\\u2019s gesture.\\xa0 Touching his nose.</p>\\n<p><em>Scents?</em></p>\\n<p><em>Pheromones</em>.</p>\\n<p>It was how he controlled the beast he had made.</p>\\n<p>I could see him as he tidied papers, only periodically glancing over his shoulder.\\xa0 He hummed.\\xa0 But for some stubble on his chin, he looked like a gentleman, with a four-button vest under a butcher\\u2019s apron and an ankle-length raincoat.\\xa0 His hair was sandy, parted to one side.</p>\\n<p>I could see the creature raise its head.\\xa0 The meal was in its mouth, and it was angling its head to let it all slide down its gullet.</p>\\n<p>Its creator used a pair of tongs to collect a bloody sack.\\xa0 I took it to be the sack the creature\\u2019s meal had been in.\\xa0 Another pig, perhaps.</p>\\n<p>He disappeared from view.</p>\\n<p>A rustle.</p>\\n<p>Then the tongs clanged to the floor.\\xa0 The beast changed the angle of its head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA <em>child</em>?\\u201d the man\\u2019s voice was touched with incredulity.</p>\\n<p>There was a commotion, a scrape of steel on concrete as a foot dragged on the tongs.</p>\\n<p>I remained where I was.</p>\\n<p>The struggle continued, intermittent, as he backed up, the desk of papers to one side, the table of bottles to the other.\\xa0 He had a carving knife to Gordon\\u2019s throat.\\xa0 Presumably the same one he\\u2019d used to cut open the creature\\u2019s meal and get its attention.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo of you.\\xa0 Are there more?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon was silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m asking you!\\u201d the man was angry, outraged.\\xa0 \\u201cAre there <em>more?\\xa0 </em>Girl!\\xa0 How many?\\xa0 Tell me or I cut him!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA few,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cFour.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe noise outside.\\xa0 That was one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFive, if you count him,\\u201d she said, her voice small.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo <em>not</em> play games with me!\\u201d the man roared.\\xa0 \\u201cShow yourselves!\\xa0 Each of you!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I exhaled slowly.</p>\\n<p>I stepped out of the gap by the water tank.</p>\\n<p>Helen was above, at the hayloft.\\xa0 Standing by the edge.\\xa0 Lillian was closer to the door.\\xa0 She and Gordon had been hiding in or near a garbage bin.</p>\\n<p>The beast was relaxed, having just eaten its fill.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Children?</em>\\u201d the man sounded incredulous.</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t wrong.\\xa0 At thirteen, Lillian was the oldest of us.\\xa0 Gordon was only twelve as of last month.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said, his voice strained.\\xa0 The man had his throat caught in the crook of one arm, exposing his lower throat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAn <em>infestation</em>,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy experiment didn\\u2019t root you out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>His eye traveled over each of us in turn.\\xa0 I saw the faintest crease appear between his eyebrows.</p>\\n<p>He seemed to come to a realization.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ve covered yourself in something.\\xa0 So it can\\u2019t smell you.\\xa0 This was premeditated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I met Lillian\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 I jerked my chin.\\xa0 Pointed at her with my hand.</p>\\n<p>The easy, natural interactions and cooperation that followed from years of working together weren\\u2019t there with Lil.\\xa0 She was new.\\xa0 A recent addition to the group.</p>\\n<p>I almost thought she got the wrong idea, until she opened her mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2026 heard about you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHeard what?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat there was something loose in the slums.\\xa0 It was eating pets.\\xa0 It ate a man that was sleeping outside.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are witnesses.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe witnesses are wrong,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou let it go out to find its own food,\\u201d Gordon said, his voice still strangled.\\xa0 \\u201cYou couldn\\u2019t afford to keep it fed as it grew this large.\\xa0 You let it feed on strays.\\xa0 Which it did.\\xa0 Except one of those strays was human.\\xa0 It\\u2019s in the book.\\xa0 Meal, unknown type.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I edged around behind the man.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019re talking about.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve studied its leavings,\\u201d the man said, ignoring the label.\\xa0 \\u201cNothing human.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing <em>conclusively</em> human, you mean,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you aren\\u2019t able to identify all of what it ate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou!\\u201d\\xa0 The man raised his voice.\\xa0 He sounded more emotional than before.\\xa0 \\u201cUp there!\\xa0 Girl!\\xa0 Stay put.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen froze where she was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a killer,\\u201d Gordon said, more insistent.\\xa0 \\u201cWe were calling you the snake charmer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I edged closer to the table.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t make a sound, but the snake charmer sensed trouble before it arrived.\\xa0 He wheeled on me, the knife dangerously close to Gordon\\u2019s throat.</p>\\n<p>I lunged in the same movement, seizing the big bottle.\\xa0 The venom.\\xa0 I held it high.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t care what happens to him?\\u201d the snake charmer asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI care,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s why, if you cut him, and if it looks like he isn\\u2019t going to be okay, I\\u2019m going to throw this at the both of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The snake charmer\\u2019s eyes darted around.\\xa0 He couldn\\u2019t watch all of us at once.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMove!\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cGo around.\\xa0 I want you as a group.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t budge.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMove!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No</em>,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s over, snake charmer,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat is not my name!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a name they\\u2019ll give you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019ll make you a monster.\\xa0 It\\u2019s what the Academy does.\\xa0 Dehumanizes the dangerous ones.\\xa0 You can\\u2019t get all of us, not with the way things are, here.\\xa0 Some are bound to escape.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll tell people, and those people will find you.\\xa0 You know the resources the Academy has.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d the snake charmer said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t know?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is <em>not</em> my fault,\\u201d the snake charmer said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Academy\\u2026 this rests on their shoulders, not mine.\\xa0 You can\\u2019t enroll without showing your skill, and you can\\u2019t show your skill without experimenting, but oh, no, they don\\u2019t <em>allow</em> that, do they?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are ways,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo!\\u201d the man barked, \\u201cNo!\\xa0 Not nearly enough.\\xa0 The world is changing, and <em>they\\u2019re</em> deciding the course.\\xa0 <em>They\\u2019re</em> putting us in this situation, where risks have to be taken.\\xa0 Gambles have to be made, or history will continue to be made, names attached to great discoveries, and the rest of us?\\xa0 If we\\u2019re lucky, we get left by the wayside.\\xa0 If we\\u2019re not, we\\u2019re just fuel for what <em>they\\u2019re </em>setting in motion.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m a student there,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI just started, but\\u2026 I\\u2019m enrolled.\\xa0 First year of study.\\xa0 Not them.\\xa0 Just me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could see the man\\u2019s expression twist.\\xa0 Incomprehension.\\xa0 Comprehension, which was almost worse.\\xa0 Hatred for a thirteen year old girl.</p>\\n<p>Then rage, not a clean, pure kind, but one that only drove him further into a corner.</p>\\n<p>His hand tightened on the grip of the knife.</p>\\n<p>I figured out the destination he was arriving at before he did.</p>\\n<p>I arrived at my own, and I mustered up some courage.</p>\\n<p>Very deliberately, I grunted, heaving the bottle of acid at the snake charmer.</p>\\n<p>He heard the grunt, but so did Gordon.\\xa0 With the snake charmer\\u2019s attention caught between Lillian and me, Gordon found a chance to protect his throat, keeping the knife from cutting.</p>\\n<p>The bottle flew lazily through the air.\\xa0 Gordon ducked, head down, and the snake charmer released him.</p>\\n<p>The man caught the bottle in a bear hug.</p>\\n<p>He stared down at the container.</p>\\n<p>All the same emotions he\\u2019d felt for Lillian, now aimed at me, progressing much faster this time.\\xa0 Incomprehension, comprehension, hatred, rage.</p>\\n<p>Directed at me.</p>\\n<p>I backed away, stumbling, falling.\\xa0 I covered my face as he swung, using the waterproof cloth to try and shield my body.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t throw at me, but at the floor.\\xa0 The chance of me catching it was small, but by throwing it at the floor, he could guarantee that the bottle would shatter into a spray I couldn\\u2019t possibly shield all of myself from.</p>\\n<p>The pain was sharp, at first, droplets touching skin, immediately breaking it down.\\xa0 Then it burned.</p>\\n<p>The horrible <em>coldness</em> was worse, because it suggested dying nerves.\\xa0 All down my arms, and one side of my face.</p>\\n<p>I screamed.</p>\\n<p>The creature turned its head, but didn\\u2019t move.</p>\\n<p>The man turned, wheeling on the others.\\xa0 Gordon was ready, already closing in, taking advantage of the short moment it took the snake charmer to adjust his grip on the knife, so soon after heaving the bottle.</p>\\n<p>A tackle, shoulder into the man\\u2019s gut, taking advantage of smaller size and a good physique.\\xa0 Gordon drove the man back.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was the hero, golden haired, noble, likeable.\\xa0 Talented.</p>\\n<p>When he broke away, letting the snake charmer stumble back two steps, recovering balance, Gordon had the knife in hand.</p>\\n<p>The beast rose to its feet.\\xa0 Sniffing.</p>\\n<p>I managed to stop screaming, going as still as possible.</p>\\n<p>It still edged closer to me.\\xa0 Interested.</p>\\n<p><em>Still hungry,\\xa0 </em>I noted.</p>\\n<p>Helen acted.\\xa0 Tipping over the barrel.</p>\\n<p>Drenching the snake charmer, washing away his charm, the pheromones.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrats!\\u201d the snake charmer spat the word.\\xa0 \\u201cYou little <em>shits</em>!\\xa0 You think you have control of this situation?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour experiment is trying to decide between you and Sylvester over there,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou smell, he\\u2019s bleeding.\\xa0 Both are tempting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The snake charmer made an incoherent noise.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThing is, if you start bleeding\\u2026\\u201d Gordon said, trailing off.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ll suddenly be a lot more tempting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTry it,\\u201d the snake charmer said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon did.\\xa0 He approached, and the snake charmer tried to grab him.</p>\\n<p>The man\\u2019s hands only grabbed clothes.\\xa0 A hood and cloak meant to keep the rain off.\\xa0 Gordon let him, and ducked low, the clothing bunching up around his neck and upper chest.</p>\\n<p>Gordon sliced the snake charmer\\u2019s stomach.\\xa0 A shallow cut.</p>\\n<p>Another grab, wrestling Gordon, trying to overpower with strength, seizing one arm.</p>\\n<p>Gordon let the knife drop out of one hand, falling into the palm of another.</p>\\n<p>He cut the back of the man\\u2019s left knee.\\xa0 When the man fell, screaming, Gordon cut the other knee.\\xa0 He skipped back as the snake charmer fell.</p>\\n<p>The snake stirred, its attention no longer predominantly on me.</p>\\n<p>I could see the snake charmer realizing the same thing I had minutes ago.\\xa0 He knew his experiment.\\xa0 He knew how it hunted.\\xa0 It scavenged, sniffing out prey.\\xa0 Blind, it reacted to noise and smell.\\xa0 Minimizing the noise one made was vital.</p>\\n<p>Given the situation, however, staying silent spelled the man\\u2019s doom.\\xa0 Already, his creation was sniffing him out.\\xa0 He smelled of blood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPheromones,\\u201d he said, knowing how dangerous it was to speak, that every sound helped him lose the tug of war that let the creature decide between devouring him and devouring <em>me</em>.\\xa0 \\u201cLet me- I\\u2019ll come with you.\\xa0 You can take me in.\\xa0 You win.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Nobody moved or responded.</p>\\n<p>He used his arms to pull himself forward, progressing toward the table.\\xa0 Each motion drew more attention from his beast.</p>\\n<p>Foot by foot, he closed on the table, and each sound was akin to a fisherman\\u2019s line, reeling in the beast.</p>\\n<p>He reached the table, struggling, and he raised himself up, using one hand to drag a leg forward, propping it under him.\\xa0 Reaching across the table-</p>\\n<p>Gordon kicked the leg of the table, hard.\\xa0 The table shifted a foot, and the snake charmer collapsed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The snake charmer looked at us.\\xa0 At Gordon, then Helen, who loomed above, perched on the hayloft.\\xa0 At me, as I glared at him, my face burned.\\xa0 At Lillian, who was sitting in the corner, hands over her head.</p>\\n<p>Who was not one of us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot like this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s expression didn\\u2019t change.\\xa0 Gordon shifted his position, placing himself between the snake charmer and the table, arms folded.\\xa0 I remained where I was, limp and breathing hard.</p>\\n<p>I could see it dawn on the man.\\xa0 Comprehension settling in as he realized what he was dealing with.</p>\\n<p>The snake seized the man\\u2019s feet, and began the very slow process of swallowing him.</p>\\n<p>The snake charmer\\u2019s screams became frantic.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d Gordon said, raising his voice to be heard over the screams.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to see.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen shield your eyes.\\xa0 But your job is to keep us in one piece.\\xa0 Sly is hurt.\\xa0 Focus, and make sure he

keeping us moving and trying to examine me.\\xa0 It made for some uncomfortable stumbling and fumbling around, including some grazing touches of the burns, but I didn\\u2019t want her to stop doing any of it.\\xa0 I bit my tongue and inside cheek and endured it, blinking my eyes to try to generate the tears I needed to clear my vision.\\xa0 I was mostly effective.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was waiting outside, his book under one arm, our shoes and boots in the other hand.\\xa0 All the laces had been tied together, making for only one knot that he had to hold to carry them all.</p>\\n<p>The bundle dropped from his fingers and landed in a puddle.\\xa0 I spotted my left shoe, on its side in the puddle.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re hurt!\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou just got my shoe wet,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I started to point, then winced as skin pulled where the enzymes had eaten away a spot on my arm.\\xa0 I held back a cry of pain.\\xa0 My arms had taken the brunt of it.\\xa0 There wasn\\u2019t a spot on the back of my arms where I could have laid a hand flat without touching something the enzymes had devoured.\\xa0 Some of the burns eclipsed my hands in size, and my arms weren\\u2019t large.\\xa0 My skin looked like a sock that was as much holes as it was fabric, and the flesh beneath was angry, a scalded red, with blood seeping out from crevices.</p>\\n<p>More burns on a similar scale speckled my neck, one cheek, my side, my legs, and one foot.\\xa0 My clothes had absorbed the worst of it, elsewhere, only droplets reaching through.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI saw through the window, but I didn\\u2019t realize how bad it was,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought you all had everything in hand, but then Sy fell, and I wasn\\u2019t sure if I should go for help-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy shoe,\\u201d I commented, managing to point this time around.\\xa0 Fixating on one thing made it easier to handle the pain.\\xa0 The wounds themselves didn\\u2019t hurt, but the edges burned like fire.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy didn\\u2019t fall.\\xa0 He <em>took a fall</em>.\\xa0 Wording,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie\\u2019s expression switched from confusion to an accusing glance.\\xa0 Thinking that Gordon might be wrong didn\\u2019t even cross his mind.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou got yourself badly hurt, you twit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid I?\\u201d I tried to exaggerate the surprise in my voice, and all the pain-relief chemicals that my body was dosing me with made me sound even more exaggerated, my voice almost breaking.\\xa0 I added some sarcasm for good measure, \\u201cOh.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t noticed.\\xa0 Thank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian spoke up, \\u201cIt\\u2019s nothing too dangerous.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t like some of these spots on your side, but I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re going to die from it.\\xa0 Not <em>soon</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot soon.\\xa0 That\\u2019s the best we can hope for,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie looked closer at one of the wounds.\\xa0 With Gordon still supporting me and both Jamie and Lillian fussing, there were a few more accidental touches of the burns.\\xa0 One of the touches didn\\u2019t actually hurt so much, but I played it up, flinching and letting a gasp out, if only to get them to stop.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t let him distract you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s trying to dodge the \\u2018why\\u2019 question.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m trying to hurry this along,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cPriorities.\\xa0 Can I get medical attention?\\xa0 Pretty please?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStill dodging the question,\\u201d Gordon observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s go,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWait.\\xa0 Jamie needs to pick up my shoe, which is getting soaked through, <em>then</em> we can go.\\xa0 Maybe since Jamie won\\u2019t stop <em>touching</em> me to make sure I\\u2019m okay, Jamie and Lillian can make sure I walk okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon looked me over, suspicious.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ll tell us on the way, then?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAssuming there\\u2019s something to tell,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I felt the burning at my wrist get worse, and my little noise of pain wasn\\u2019t intentional.\\xa0 I reached for my wrist, and Lillian slapped my hand away like I was a kid going for the cookie jar.\\xa0 For her benefit, I said, \\u201cHurts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Good,</em>\\u201d she said, sounding like a cross between the bossy older sister and a schoolteacher.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe you won\\u2019t do that again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She wiped at my arm, clearing away blood where it had welled out from the center of the burn.\\xa0 Where the blood had run through the edges of the scar, the trickle had left a faint pink line.\\xa0 Spreading the enzyme around.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d I cut him off.</p>\\n<p>There was a pause.\\xa0 I hesitated to call it tension.\\xa0 He wanted me to come to my senses, I wanted to wait long enough for his concern for my well being to override his curiosity, which was bound to happen sooner or later.\\xa0 Tension implied something being stretched to a limit, but we were both being <em>patient</em>.</p>\\n<p>I felt the burning sensation at my side getting worse.\\xa0 From a six to a seven on the scale, and I was the one who caved, in the end.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI promise I\\u2019ll tell you after,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He seemed to consider, rolling his head to one side, then the other.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFine.\\xa0 Jamie, take over?\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSeems to want you for some reason.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie is shorter, I don\\u2019t have to stand on my tip toes while he\\u2019s holding me up,\\u201d I explained.</p>\\n<p>Gordon transferred his hold on me to Jamie, who had to transfer his hold on his book to the other arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd he\\u2019s nicer,\\u201d I added.\\xa0 Jamie rolled his eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid you lock the windows?\\u201d Gordon asked, ignoring me.\\xa0 The question was aimed at Helen, who had emerged from the door behind us.</p>\\n<p>I turned my head to see Helen\\u2019s nod.\\xa0 She and Gordon worked to slide the door closed.\\xa0 The movement of the wheel through the rut spat water at our legs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s hope it stays put,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought we decided that it wouldn\\u2019t go anywhere after eating,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cCarnivore eating habits.\\xa0 Hunt or scavenge, eat, rest, rouse, repeat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was hungry enough to eat two meals.\\xa0 Probably going through a final growth spurt,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s not rule anything out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Lillian said, right beside me, and I was genuinely surprised at the note of anxiety in her voice, how it had cut the word short.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can leave now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Very nearly but not a question.\\xa0 A plea?</p>\\n<p>I suspected it was fear, but that suspicion sat askew in my head.\\xa0 Lillian had experience with that stuff.\\xa0 She\\u2019d had hands on experience with creatures and experiments at the Academy.\\xa0 More restrained than that one had been, but the idea of the unrestrained experiment wasn\\u2019t enough to justify the thought.\\xa0 It was <em>probably</em> well fed enough that it would ignore any meal that didn\\u2019t walk right into its open mouth.</p>\\n<p>Or lay there struggling as the snake charmer had.</p>\\n<p><em>There we are</em>,<em>\\xa0</em>I thought.\\xa0 <em>The snake charmer.\\xa0</em> I could remember Lillian shielding her eyes.\\xa0 The anxiety had more to do with the reminder of the man and the way he\\u2019d left this world.\\xa0 If he had left it.\\xa0 There was a chance he was still in there, alive and slowly dissolving.</p>\\n<p>Gordon had collected the bundle of shoes but hadn\\u2019t handed them out.\\xa0 Which was fine.\\xa0 My feet were muddy, and I had a burn on the top of my foot that would have made wearing the shoes hard.\\xa0 The burn announced its presence every time I stepped in a puddle.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t a particularly short walk back, and I was content to keep my mouth shut.\\xa0 If I started talking, I might have started grunting or making noises in response to the pain.\\xa0 If I started whimpering, then Gordon might have started reminding me that I\\u2019d done this to myself.</p>\\n<p>Instead, I focused on the future.\\xa0 The snake charmer had been handled.\\xa0 Were questions possible?\\xa0 What about my injuries?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re close to King,\\u201d Jamie said, interrupting my thoughts.\\xa0 I realized Helen and Gordon were talking, with Gordon doing the lion\\u2019s share.\\xa0 I\\u2019d tuned it out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I noted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBusy street means head down,\\u201d Jamie said, very patient.\\xa0 He tugged on the front of my hood, so it could shroud my face in shadow.\\xa0 \\u201cHood down.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t want your face to scare the locals any more than usual.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t help but smile wide at that.</p>\\n<p>The main street was framed on both sides by taller buildings, a great many of them being <em>apartments</em>.\\xa0 People sat on steps beneath the overhang of their porches, smoking, and the occasional light glowed from within rooms above.</p>\\n<p>The plant growth that supported the structures reached overhead to meet and mesh.\\xa0 An arch, to introduce us to the main street proper.\\xa0 King Street.\\xa0 It was a thick crowd, even in the late afternoon, the sun setting.\\xa0 Men and women in raincoats, with umbrellas, walking on either side of the road.</p>\\n<p>Lillian and Jamie stopped supporting me quite so much.\\xa0 I started to teeter over a bit, and Jamie caught me at roughly the same point I stuck a leg out to catch my balance myself.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t realized how heavily I\\u2019d been leaning on the others, or how dizzy I felt.</p>\\n<p>Horses pulling coaches outnumbered cars at a nine to one ratio.\\xa0 Of those horses drawing coaches, only one in five were truly <em>alive</em>.\\xa0 The remainder were stitched, their hides patchwork, seams joined by thick black thread or by metal staples with burns where they touched flesh.\\xa0 Were I able to see beneath the heavy raincoats, I would have seen the thick metal bolts that had been screwed into points down their spines.</p>\\n<p><em>Live</em> horses were an affectation, really.\\xa0 There was a convenience to them, as they didn\\u2019t suffer from the water in this city where it <em>always</em> rained, they could be taken out hunting, and they had personalities.\\xa0 A horse could be a member of one\\u2019s family.\\xa0 There was a lot to like.</p>\\n<p>But the stitched horses, <em>voltaic</em> horses if you asked someone who knew what they were talking about, they were cheap, they didn\\u2019t get tired, and rather than food, they could be kept going by connecting wires to the bolts on their backs and waiting.\\xa0 When a stitched horse had done its work for the day, it could be placed in what amounted to a long closet.</p>\\n<p>There were no rules for the road, but everyone found their way.\\xa0 Most people here knew most others.\\xa0 A lack of courtesy today could be paid by a lack of cooperation from others tomorrow.\\xa0 That wasn\\u2019t to say there weren\\u2019t idiots or disagreeable types who others paid no mind to, but it largely <em>worked</em>.</p>\\n<p>Like the branches and plant growth, it amounted to a planned chaos.\\xa0 The exact shape and character of branches couldn\\u2019t be decided in advance, but the key elements were given attention, the problematic ones pruned.\\xa0 The squat apartment buildings didn\\u2019t have room for even stitched horses, which meant every essential service had been put within walking distance.\\xa0 Pubs, grocers, tailors, barbers and the like.</p>\\n<p>I raised my eyes.\\xa0 Looking down the length of King, I could see it rise at a gradual incline, until it touched the perimeter of the Academy itself.\\xa0 Radham Academy, to be specific.\\xa0 All things flowed from it, all things flowed to it.\\xa0 I imagined the same went for any Academy.\\xa0 Stick one somewhere, and people would collect to it like flies to a carcass.\\xa0 The advances and work that went hand in hand with an Academy would bleed out in a very similar way.\\xa0 First to the city as a whole, then to surrounding regions.</p>\\n<p>Jamie grabbed the tip of my hood and tugged down, forcing me to look at the ground in front of me.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been showing too much of my face.</p>\\n<p>We moved as a huddle, and with our heads down and hoods up, we weren\\u2019t much different from half of the streets\\u2019 occupants.\\xa0 My burns didn\\u2019t earn me a second glance, because I scarcely warranted a first one.\\xa0 I suspected that Gordon had chosen where he stood with the idea of shielding me from others\\u2019 sight, for added assurance.</p>\\n<p>I liked the thought.\\xa0 It made me wonder if any other people in the crowd were in similar straits.</p>\\n<p>Ahead of us, a large shape loomed.\\xa0 It looked like the offspring of a deer or rabbit might, if their offspring was squeezed out too early.\\xa0 No larger than one of the cars on the street, it was pink, with stretched skin, the translucent eyelids appearing bruised with how they let some of the darkness of the black eyeballs beneath leak through.\\xa0 Its head sat crooked, forcing it to see the way forward with only one of its two wide set eyes.\\xa0 Its mouth hung open.</p>\\n<p>Most prominent, however, were the legs.\\xa0 Not much thicker around than <em>my</em> leg, half again as long as the tallest man on the sidewalk was tall, the four legs ended in points, a single claw to each leg.\\xa0 Saddlebags were strapped to saddlebags to form chains that draped the thing like a peculiar sort of jewelry.</p>\\n<p>As the coaches and cars on the road made way and cooperated, so did the people on the sidewalk.\\xa0 This however, was motivated by discomfort and fear.\\xa0 Men and women gave the thing almost the entire sidewalk to itself.</p>\\n<p>A woman led it on a fine chain, holding an umbrella overhead, though the creature\\u2019s mass already helped shelter her from the rain.\\xa0 She was barely entering into her twilight years, but only the pale color of her once-blonde hair suggested as much.\\xa0 Her face and body were young, and her clothes looked expensive, though they tended toward the simple.</p>\\n<p>I very nearly tipped over again, as Jamie let go of me and stepped forward to obscure the woman\\u2019s view of me.</p>\\n<p>Feeling as wobbly as I did was more than a little concerning, and a <em>delay</em> was the last thing I wanted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHello Mrs. Thetford,\\u201d Helen greeted the woman, smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d Mrs. Thetford said, tugging on the chain to make her packbeast stop in its tracks.\\xa0 Her expression changed from an easy smile to shock.\\xa0 \\u201cLook at you!\\xa0 You look like something the cat dragged in!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>How apt</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s Sylvester\\u2019s fault,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe pushed me and I got wet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Of course she invents a lie that makes me look bad.\\xa0 </em>I made a point of hanging my head, to better conceal my injuries.\\xa0 I could see the crowd passing around and to either side of us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester, for <em>shame</em>,\\u201d Mrs. Thetford said, and she used my name as a rebuke, and the way she said \\u2018shame\\u2019 even made me feel a bit abashed over the deed I hadn\\u2019t committed.\\xa0 \\u201cYou really should be nicer to girls.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe really should,\\u201d Helen said, and her tone was <em>perfect</em>.\\xa0 Just a little bit smug, chiding, but not so much of either that Mrs. Thetford would think less of her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd <em>you</em>,\\u201d Mrs. Thetford said, reaching under Helen\\u2019s hood to comb Helen\\u2019s hair back with long fingernails.\\xa0 \\u201cYou should give some thought to keeping better company.\\xa0 I know you\\u2019re loyal to your so-called brothers and sisters, but you could do so well if you devoted some time to others.\\xa0 Your caregivers have very nearly polished you into a diamond, and it would warm my heart to see you finish the transformation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, Ma\\u2019am,\\u201d Helen said, smiling, pretending to be a little shy.\\xa0 Not a lot, but enough to be humble.\\xa0 \\u201cIt means a lot that you think so well of me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you decide that you would like to become more of a <em>lad</em><em>y</em>, I would be more than happy to introduce you to some people who could teach you the finer points.\\xa0 Music, dancing, etiquette.\\xa0 The same goes for you, Gordon.\\xa0 You\\u2019re evidence that Helen here isn\\u2019t a simple fluke.\\xa0 It would take more doing, but I think we could turn you into a proper gentleman with some tutoring.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI might take you up on that offer, ma\\u2019am,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo!\\xa0 You should,\\u201d the older woman said.\\xa0 She brushed Helen\\u2019s cheek with her fingers.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re a <em>dear</em>.\\xa0 I would have you for myself, if I hadn\\u2019t already had my fill of raising children.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor now, if it\\u2019s alright, I\\u2019ll have to content myself with getting home before it\\u2019s dark.\\xa0 I\\u2019m looking forward to getting dry again,\\u201d Helen said, sticking me with a look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course!\\xa0 Now I feel bad for keeping you.\\xa0 You know where to find me if you would like those lessons.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We hurried on.\\xa0 Rather than take the long route around to the sides, we passed under and between the legs of the packbeast that was carrying Mrs. Thetford\\u2019s shopping.</p>\\n<p>By the time we\\u2019d flowed back into the crowd, almost invisible, Helen\\u2019s expression had gone flat again, her eyes cold.\\xa0 The smile was gone.</p>\\n<p>She saw me looking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you upset?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy would I be upset?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI blamed you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI always get blamed.\\xa0 I\\u2019m used to it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She seemed to take that at face value.</p>\\n<p>I might have pursued conversation, but it would have been purely for self gratification, and I was feeling less and less like talking.\\xa0 My brain had apparently decided that the easiest way to handle what I was feeling was to declare that <em>all</em> of me hurt, and certain parts of me hurt enough that I was reconsidering my \\u2018one to ten\\u2019 scale of pain.\\xa0 If I focused on any one part of me too much, it quickened.</p>\\n<p>All of that in mind, I was very glad to see the orphanage.</p>\\n<p>The building was perched in an odd spot, beside a creek and a stone bridge that was thick with grown-in vegetation. The land by the riverbed was stony, uneven, and threatened to be damp, discouraging building efforts, but the building itself had been here long before the Academy, serving as a home for shepherds when Radham had only been a few buildings set around a crossroads.</p>\\n<p>That it had withstood the test of time was either pure luck, or the person who had mortared the stones together had known what they were doing.</p>\\n<p>One floor tall, with a stone exterior, it lacked the reinforcing growths that marked so many nearby structures.\\xa0 The only wood came from a tree in the backyard.\\xa0 A short stone wall encircled the property, only three feet tall, and the height both served as a way of keeping the smallest children on the property and was paradoxically <em>welcoming</em>.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t approach it without wanting to hop up onto it.</p>\\n<p>Toward the back of the property, I could see that Ralph Stein was in the process of walking the top of the wall.\\xa0 The route went from the right side of the gate, over to the right of the house, alongside the riverbank, around the back of the house, under the tricky bit where the tree\\u2019s branches hung over, up the left side of the house, and then over to the left side of the gate.\\xa0 All on the weather-rounded, uneven stones that made up the wall\\u2019s top, virtually always in the rain.</p>\\n<p>My focus wasn\\u2019t on that.</p>\\n<p>My focus was on the black coach parked to the left of the house, beneath the overhang in the roof.\\xa0 The horses were wearing black raincoats, utterly still.\\xa0 Their driver stood beside them, smoking.</p>\\n<p>My eye didn\\u2019t leave them as we made our way down the steps that had been set into the slope.\\xa0 Each one of the stone stairs had seen enough traffic and years that they\\u2019d been reshaped, as if buckling faintly under thousands of footfalls.</p>\\n<p>Gordon pushed open the door.\\xa0 Lillian and Jamie helped me through.</p>\\n<p>We stopped in our tracks at the sight of a man in the front hallway.</p>\\n<p>If it had a brain and a nervous system, the parts could be used for making a stitch, or voltaic creature.\\xa0 The quality of that stitched was indicated by the placement of the stitches that gave them their name.\\xa0 Poorer work or a stitched that had been \\u2018repaired\\u2019 often involved joins in visible or inconvenient places.\\xa0 Across the face, or across the joints, where they interfered with function.\\xa0 A <em>good</em> stitch had the joins and scars kept just out of sight, under the chin, or in places where clothes could cover the work.</p>\\n<p>The figure that stood guard by the door was the most human-like stitched I\\u2019d ever seen.\\xa0 Tall, broad-shouldered, the parts had been selected for size and raw power.\\xa0 But for stitches visible just past the cuffs of his jacket, I might not have known.\\xa0 He wore a suit under a hooded raincoat and carried a pistol at his hip.</p>\\n<p>He was, in two short words, a problem.</p>\\n<p>I smelled tea, and I heard very little commotion.\\xa0 If I hadn\\u2019t seen the coach outside, I could have put two and two together to figure out that we had a guest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be the children,\\u201d Mrs. Earles said.</p>\\n<p>The others properly put away hoods, cloaks, shoes and boots before toweling their feet to a reasonable state of clean and dry.\\xa0 Lillian bent down and had me lift up my feet one by one to dry them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s what I\\u2019m here for,\\u201d she murmured back.</p>\\n<p>One by one, we headed around the corner from the front hall, into the sitting room.\\xa0 The room itself had homey touches, and was very much <em>Mrs. Earles</em>.\\xa0 It was her perch in the evenings, the part she made her home.\\xa0 The knick-knacks and decorative carvings, still, were placed well out of reach of errant hands, on the mantlepiece above the blazing fireplace and on various shelves and bookshelves.</p>\\n<p>My eyes scanned the shelves and bookshelves.\\xa0 Searching.</p>\\n<p>Mrs. Earles didn\\u2019t give off the image of someone who ran an orphanage.\\xa0 She\\u2019d struck me more as the assistant to that sort of someone.\\xa0 Managing <em>one</em> child had a way of turning women into <em>mothers, </em>wearing away at certain things while exaggerating others.\\xa0 Even with help, managing sixteen should have pushed her to an extreme in some respect.\\xa0 Something in the vein of a tyrant or a defeated woman, a woman who turned to vice to escape stresses, or a saint.\\xa0 But she wasn\\u2019t any of those things.</p>\\n<p>A part of me wanted to think of her as a mother, but she wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t pretend to be.\\xa0 She ran Lambsbridge, she kept us fed and sheltered, and she was quick to use the threat of a smack to keep us in line.\\xa0 Even though I\\u2019d been a recipient more than once, I could appreciate that she didn\\u2019t hesitate in that respect.\\xa0 I had to live with fifteen others, and if they were allowed to run rampant, I faced more grief than I did dealing with the occasional rap to the knuckles.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle, by that same token, was almost but not quite my father.</p>\\n<p>He frowned as he saw me, immediately taking in details that more than a hundred people in the busier part of the city had failed to spot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll make sure you don\\u2019t have eavesdroppers,\\u201d Mrs. Earles said, disappearing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d Mr. Hayle said, without turning to look at her.</p>\\n<p>We stood in the entry to the sitting room, while he examined each of us, silent.</p>\\n<p>He was an older man.\\xa0 Sixty or so, as far as anyone\\u2019s age could be pinned down with certainty.\\xa0 He hadn\\u2019t prettied himself up or taken advantage of Radham Academy\\u2019s resources to remove wrinkles or revitalize his hair.\\xa0 His hair was grey and waxed back away from his face, and his wrinkles cut so deep into his face that I could have imagined them as cross-hatching done with a scalpel.\\xa0 He wore a doctor\\u2019s coat indoors, the fabric thick, dyed black so that it wouldn\\u2019t show any blood stains.\\xa0 His gloves had been pulled off, and the ends were sticking out of one pocket.\\xa0 A collection of files were already tucked under one arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe other children are accounted for.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll be in the kitchen, where I can intercept anyone coming your way,\\u201d Mrs. Earles said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>She retreated, leaving us alone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was planning on a longer meeting,\\u201d Mr. Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cTo look at Sylvester, he might not be able to stand for the duration.\\xa0 Is he stable?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m stable,\\u201d I said, at the same time Lillian said, \\u201cHe is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat happened to you?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 Hold off on that.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re stable, let\\u2019s cover the essentials.\\xa0 Tell me, how was it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon answered.\\xa0 \\u201cOur target\\u2019s second experiment is in one of the warehouses, off to the southeast of King.\\xa0 Sleeping off a meal, we\\u2019re hoping.\\xa0 It\\u2019s there, with all of the notes.\\xa0 As for the target, he\\u2019s\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn his experiment,\\u201d I said, managing a smile.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle didn\\u2019t smile back.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand.\\xa0 Clarify?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDead,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSwallowed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cComplications?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We collectively uttered a chorus of \\u2018nos\\u2019 and shook our heads.\\xa0 I glanced at the back of Jamie\\u2019s head, saw the faintest hesitation before he joined us in shaking his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat happened to Sylvester?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe snake charm- ah, our target, he arrived, forcing us to hide.\\xa0 He found me in my hiding spot, purely by chance, and took me hostage.\\xa0 Sylvester distracted him, and was splashed with-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnzymes,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSplashed with enzymes, during the altercation that followed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did what I could,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cNeutralized the spread with counteragents our target had on hand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cGood.\\xa0 Lillian, I believe this marks your third assignment with the group?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould you do another?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t miss the hesitation on Lillian\\u2019s part.</p>\\n<p>I tried to view things through her eyes.\\xa0 Seeing the man get swallowed.\\xa0 The horror.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would, sir,\\u201d she decided.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll continue to have my support at the Academy, then.\\xa0 If you don\\u2019t find all doors are open and all resources available to you, let me know.\\xa0 Your tuition will continue to be waived.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat takes care of the, ah, what did you call him?\\xa0 The snake charmer?\\xa0 Now, unless there\\u2019s anything else, I should look after Sylvester there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a jumble of \\u2018no sir\\u2019s from the others.</p>\\n<p>He crossed the room, and the others were quick to get out of his way.\\xa0 I used the opportunity to move to one side, further into the sitting room, and scanned the shelves.</p>\\n<p><em>There</em>.</p>\\n<p>Mrs. Earles didn\\u2019t keep matches close to the fireplace, and she didn\\u2019t keep them where the smaller children could get them.</p>\\n<p>Even for me, it would require that I stand on my toes and reach high overhead.</p>\\n<p>The problems that came with being <em>small</em>.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle was talking while he found and put on his boots.\\xa0 \\u201cI do want to have a longer discussion.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll need to rearrange my evening, which will take me at least an hour.\\xa0 Add the time it takes to deliver Sylvester\\u2026 hm, it would be late.\\xa0 Too late?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe younger children will be in bed.\\xa0 I could ask Mrs. Earles,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll be by in the morning.\\xa0 I only considered tonight because I thought you\\u2019d want to know how Sylvester was.\\xa0 I can send someone your way, if you\\u2019re willing to keep an eye out the window for them.\\xa0 A quiet, short visit to pass on word.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease, sir,\\u201d Gordon said, sounding far more solemn than I\\u2019d have expected.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll see to it.\\xa0 Thank you for another job well done.\\xa0 Sylvester?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was out of time.</p>\\n<p>With a wall between myself and Mr. Hayle, each of the others positioned to see, I reached up to the shelf, and felt my burns stretch, eliciting a tearing sensation, and a fresh renewal of pain.</p>\\n<p>I closed my fingers around the matchbook, then collapsed against the wall, panting.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProblem?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMoved too fast,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle gave me a sincere look of concern as he did up the buttons of his coat and took his umbrella from his stitched bodyguard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s get you looked after,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He paused.\\xa0 \\u201cNo shoes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBurn on my foot,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCarry on, then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I discovered that <em>stopping</em> and then moving again was quite possibly the worst thing I could have done.\\xa0 Every burn felt <em>fresh</em>.\\xa0 The movement of my arm was the worst of it.\\xa0 The stitched bodyguard helped me, even going so far as to lift me bodily to my seat.\\xa0 All the same, by the time we reached the coach, I was sweating bullets from pain alone.</p>\\n<p>The coach\\u2019s interior was red, the windows stained to reduce the light that came in, and something that looked like a glowing orange minnow swam in a bowl overhead, casting light on the interior.</p>\\n<p>The driver steered the stitched horses around.\\xa0 Before long, we were on King Street, heading for the Academy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s rare that I have a chance to talk with one of you,\\u201d Mr. Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cCan I see your arm?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I offered it.\\xa0 He probed the edges of the injury.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI suspect you\\u2019ll resist, out of loyalty to your\\u2026 brothers and sisters?\\xa0 Is that how you think of them?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFriends.\\xa0 Gang,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I swallowed hard.\\xa0 \\u201cSometimes I think of them as siblings.\\xa0 What am I resisting?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGiving me information.\\xa0 Can you tell me if they\\u2019re doing alright?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re doing everything they\\u2019re supposed to do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that so?\\xa0 Something tells me you wouldn\\u2019t tell me if they weren\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled a little.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat makes you think that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve watched you grow up these past few years.\\xa0 I\\u2019d like to think I know you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I forbade myself from looking outside the window.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot up to talking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot sure what to say, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me about the snake charmer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir.\\xa0 Um-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A crash shook the coach.</p>\\n<p>I could hear shouts.\\xa0 Mr. Hayle\\u2019s coach came to an awkward stop, lurching, then jerking to the left before finally going still.</p>\\n<p>He twisted in his seat, and slid a panel to one side.\\xa0 \\u201cJohn?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a pause.\\xa0 The driver replied, \\u201cWater.\\xa0 Knocked me off my seat.\\xa0 One of the voltaic horses got drenched.\\xa0 It\\u2019s gone quiet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWater?\\u201d\\xa0 Mr. Hayle asked.\\xa0 He frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll be right out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I remained where I was, very much in pain after the sudden movements.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDouglas,\\u201d Mr. Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cLook after Sylvester.\\xa0 Be ready to come outside at a moment\\u2019s notice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI understand,\\u201d Douglas said, the words clumsy in a way that was hard to define.\\xa0 Too precise, the local accent rounded off at the edges.\\xa0 I suspected it would be worse if it was a more unfamiliar phrase.</p>\\n<p>The door of the coach closed.</p>\\n<p><em>One, two, three</em>.</p>\\n<p>I forced myself to sit up.</p>\\n<p>I opened my eyes.</p>\\n<p>Naturally, going outside, Mr. Hayle hadn\\u2019t taken his paperwork.</p>\\n<p>When problem solving, the simplest answer shouldn\\u2019t be discounted.</p>\\n<p>I reached for the files.</p>\\n<p>The bodyguard reached out, blocking my hand with his.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat is not yours,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 The words were clumsier than his \\u2018I understand.\\u2019</p>\\n<p>If it was a <em>human</em> bodyguard, and not one that had died and been reanimated, rendered very simple and loyal in operation, I suspected I could have manipulated him or sent him out of the coach.</p>\\n<p>Stitched were easier in some ways, harder in others.</p>\\n<p>I pulled the matches out of my pocket.</p>\\n<p>I struck it.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t flinch.</p>\\n<p>I blinked.</p>\\n<p>Reduced to very primal, simple function, they were <em>supposed</em> to have reactions to fire.\\xa0 Nine times out of ten, it was fear.\\xa0 One time out of ten, it was violent and destructive rage.</p>\\n<p>The quality of this stitched was top notch.\\xa0 Had Mr. Hayle or the person he bought the stitched from somehow solved the problem?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPut that out,\\u201d the stitched told me.</p>\\n<p>I reached out, bringing the match closer to him.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t move.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPut that out,\\u201d he said, more firmly.</p>\\n<p>I moved my hand, and he remained where he was.</p>\\n<p>No, the problem hadn\\u2019t been fixed.\\xa0 But they\\u2019d found a step forward.</p>\\n<p>He was frozen.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d hoped to distract and disturb him enough that he\\u2019d forget his instructions and let me snatch up the files.\\xa0 This, however, worked.\\xa0 Still holding the match up, the whole of his attention focused on it, I grabbed the stack of folders.</p>\\n<p>I returned to my seat.</p>\\n<p>Before I could open the folders, the door opened.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle studied me, his expression blank.</p>\\n<p>I froze, caught red handed.\\xa0 Well, the red hand was the burn, but-</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd it all makes sense,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d he said, climbing up into the coach and taking his seat, \\u201cYou <em>know</em> why I made you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEach of you.\\xa0 My colleagues in other departments have made weapons, monsters, they\\u2019ve made viruses and more, with the understanding that there may very well be a <em>need</em> for these weapons.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy focus, as you very well know, is on,\\u201d he reached over, and he tapped me on the forehead.\\xa0 \\u201cThe brain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd I was dumb just now,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFailed project?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 I made you.\\xa0 Like I said, I <em>know</em> you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it helps, I\\u2019m starting to believe you, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt would be stupid of me to make you for a purpose and not expect you to <em>fulfill</em> that purpose.\\xa0 Mistakes here and there are to be expected, and your mistake here was expecting <em>me</em> to be dumb.\\xa0 You\\u2019re still developing, and each of you are still being refined in your own ways.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you <em>ask</em> for the files?\\u201d he asked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause you might have said no, and you would have known I wanted them,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd because I think people are more genuine when you catch them off balance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething to keep in mind,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I suppose I\\u2019m getting too predictable, if you were able to arrange this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTake a look,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>For a telling second, I thought the files would be empty, that he might have checkmated me.</p>\\n<p>But I paged through them, and I found them filled with pages of data, notes, design, and more.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Helen, project Galatea.</em></p>\\n<p

\\u201cAll that for a glance?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat, specifically?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExpiration dates, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/03/19/taking-root-1-4/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>The syringe was fancy, glass with silver leaf at the ends and at the plunger.\\xa0 The glass had turned smoky where it had once been clear, and only the faintest trace of the original contents were still inside.\\xa0 Thicker around than any three of my fingers put together.\\xa0 It probably cost twenty dollars, if not more.\\xa0 A good week\\u2019s wages.</p>\\n<p>Somewhat vindictively, I pulled out the plunger until I had the weight balanced, put my fingers on it, and sent it spinning wildly on the desk, periodically rustling scattered papers or sending them floating over the desk\\u2019s surface, riding a thin layer of air.\\xa0 Traveling across the desk, it struck an identical syringe, eliciting a pair of high, sweet songs from the ringing glass.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t break.\\xa0 Shame.</p>\\n<p>I stepped over to the window, my feet kicking up more papers as they might stir leaves in the fall.\\xa0 I was at \\u2018the Hedge\\u2019, the colloquial term for the wall that encircled the Academy.\\xa0 A great deal of the wall wasn\\u2019t large or tall at all, but it rose in places, and the corner of the Academy closest to Radham had a hospital built into it.\\xa0 Through the hospital, students bought their turns at getting training and locals bought care.\\xa0 The view was of the wall itself, the Academy on one side, Radham on the other.</p>\\n<p>About the only thing that was the same about the two places was that it was raining.\\xa0 A light rain, but enough that just about everyone had their hoods up.\\xa0 The boys and girls on the Academy side moved as though they were all in a hurry.\\xa0 They were all tidy, hair well looked after, white uniforms clean.\\xa0 Their bookbags had flaps over the top to keep the rain out, and the buckles that kept the flaps in place each had the university\\u2019s symbol on it, a full-face helmet in profile framed by red leaves and ribbons.</p>\\n<p>Almost but not quite a badge of office.</p>\\n<p>Outside, watched from a distance, people moved as though they were mired in tar.\\xa0 They found their way eventually, but there was no clear direction, even in a city that had been built with a plan in mind.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t enjoy looking, but there wasn\\u2019t much else to be done.\\xa0 I\\u2019d read the books, I\\u2019d read the various papers, and I\\u2019d slept.\\xa0 Seven days I\\u2019d been cooped up here.</p>\\n<p>I felt a chill, and rubbed my hands over my bare arms.\\xa0 My skin had been replaced where the enzyme solution had devoured it, and while the pigmentation was very slightly different if I looked for it, it remained sensitive, not yet used to heat and cold, to the rubbing where seams of clothing touched it, or to idle scratches.\\xa0 I kept my shirt off, but that meant being colder, and though it was dawn and spring had sprung, it was gloomy outside.</p>\\n<p>I held the back of my hand up to the edges of the window, letting the sensitive skin feel the movements of the air.\\xa0 Slowly, so as not to disturb the air with my own movements, I moved my hand along the point where the window glass met the frame.</p>\\n<p>I felt the point where the breeze came through as though ice had touched the new skin.\\xa0 Pulling my hand away, I tore the end off one page of paper and popped the paper into my mouth before setting the syringe to spinning at full speed once again.</p>\\n<p>The syringe rattled as I got the motion wrong, and the rattle prompted the papers under the cot to rustle.\\xa0 Not because I\\u2019d moved or because I was going anywhere.</p>\\n<p>Periodically, someone came to talk to me.\\xa0 I was already figuring out their schedules.\\xa0 Going by the time of day and the schedules I\\u2019d observed over the past week, they were past due to arrive.</p>\\n<p>Being past due meant they were up to something.\\xa0 I was tense, chewing on the little bit of paper, listening past the patter of the rain on the window and the sound of the syringe spinning on the desktop.</p>\\n<p>I could hear the murmur of speech, too far away and muted to make out.</p>\\n<p>I recognized Mr. Hayle\\u2019s voice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-Or worse than before?\\u201d I could make out the tail end of the sentence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore or less the same, professor.\\xa0 But as intractable as he gets, his behavior differs from month to month.\\xa0 This time, he wanted to be alone.\\xa0 Very much so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wonder if it has something to do with the fact that it followed so quickly off the back of another incident, or the pain he was experiencing.\\xa0 Make a note.\\xa0 If we\\u2019re bringing another student on board to oversee the Wyvern file, that would be a good way to bring them up to speed while doing something constructive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, professor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a pause, pronounced, then a knock on the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t respond right away.\\xa0 Reaching up to my mouth, I pulled the wad of paper out, then jammed it up against the gap in the window where it was leaking cold air.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m here,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The door opened.\\xa0 It only opened a few inches before it hit the toppled bookcase that barred the way.\\xa0 The rest of the floor was carpeted in scattered papers, fallen books, and various folders.</p>\\n<p>I angled my head to one side, and saw Mr. Hayle do the same, peering through the gap.\\xa0 He looked at me first, then the bookcase.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow are you?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy head hurts,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 It did.\\xa0 It hurt in a very different way than my body had.\\xa0 My body had been effectively burned by the enzymes, and burns hurt more than just about anything.\\xa0 My brain, however, it felt like it had been poked, prodded, beaten and kicked into the dirt, then made to do a marathon after the fact.\\xa0 The burn only hurt the parts that were burned.\\xa0 This was the sort of pain that made <em>everyth</em><em>ing</em> hurt, and promised more pain every step of the way for the rest of the journey.</p>\\n<p>A hollow, empty, tired hurt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can well imagine.\\xa0 How in the world did you pull over the shelf?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>What he was asking was how a boy who weighed four point seven stone could pull over a floor-to-ceiling solid wood bookcase with half the books still on it.\\xa0 Mr. Hayle might not have been able to knock it down in the prime of his youth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI pushed the upper corner,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThen I dropped a book into the gap so it couldn\\u2019t go rock back to where it was.\\xa0 Pushed again, dropped more books in.\\xa0 Kept at it, and eventually it tipped.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou scared the wits out of some of my colleagues.\\xa0 They thought a part of the roof had fallen in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe thought something had <em>escaped</em>,\\u201d a woman\\u2019s voice in the hallway said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt was like someone had kicked an ants nest, people scurrying around to find out what had gone wrong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t resist smiling a little at that.</p>\\n<p>Hayle smiled, though only half was visible through the gap in the door.\\xa0 \\u201cAh, there we go.\\xa0 Your expression was so cold I thought we\\u2019d somehow lost you, Sylvester.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t suppose you could think up a way to lift the shelf back into place?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI could get started soon.\\xa0 It would take a while.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was hoping to have you out of there sooner than later,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d I asked, without missing a beat.\\xa0 I knew I sounded hostile, <em>cold</em> as he\\u2019d put it.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t care.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour\\u2026 the Lambsbridge gang has asked for you.\\xa0 I myself would appreciate your help.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyebrows went up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI might see if Douglas here can-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d I cut him off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcuse me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy do they need my help?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat, Sylvester, is a question I\\u2019m more than happy to answer, but I don\\u2019t feel like detailing it all through a door.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned, reaching up to scratch my head, looking around.</p>\\n<p>Hopping up onto the back of the bookcase, I approached the door, examining the frame and the door itself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs I was saying,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI could ask Douglas to try pushing on the door-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I seized one of the syringes, paused to set the other one to spinning, just for the heck of it, and headed over to the cot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-he should be strong enough to move the bookshelf, don\\u2019t you think, Lacey?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think so, professor,\\u201d the woman on the other side said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow that I think about it, my concern is damaging the door.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt should be okay, I think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, Douglas, come here\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>When I glanced up, Mr. Hayle wasn\\u2019t looking through the gap.\\xa0 It was probably awkward to keep in that position, right up against the door.</p>\\n<p>I put my bare shoulder under the bottom of the cot, using my whole body to lift it up.\\xa0 The metal of the cot\\u2019s frame was cold against my back.\\xa0 I set the syringe on the floor and slipped to one side to let the cot drop.\\xa0 The leg came down to break the glass.</p>\\n<p>The noise made something under the bed move, flying out to the corner by the door and bookcase.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop, Douglas.\\xa0 Sylvester,\\u201d Mr. Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat was that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAllow me one minute,\\u201d I said, absently, picking my way past the pieces of glass.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sure Douglas could get you out.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not sure what you\\u2019re doing there, but if we could <em>minimize</em> the damage and the explanations I have to give my colleagues that are working here in the Hedge, I would appreciate it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamage is done,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>If only to the syringe.\\xa0 </em>I shifted my position, lifted up the cot again, and repositioned the plunger-end of the syringe.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll be fifty seconds.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I imagined him repressing a sigh.\\xa0 All I heard, however, was a, \\u201cvery well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A doctor using a syringe had to put their fingers into two metal loops just by the plunger.\\xa0 My target was the loop.\\xa0 I moved out of the way, and let the leg of the cot fall.</p>\\n<p>I twisted and worked the loop until the metal gave way, then raised the cot again.</p>\\n<p>Using my hands, I folded the broken bit of metal in two, for a long length of metal.\\xa0 I collected a fallen medical text, and it was heavy enough I could barely hold it in one hand.</p>\\n<p>Placing the long bit of metal on the underside of the hinge, pointing up, I gave it a solid whack with the book.</p>\\n<p>The pin that held the hinge together popped up.</p>\\n<p>Another whack made it pop out.</p>\\n<p>The other hinge was high up enough that I had to stand on my toes to reach it, even with the bookcase under me.</p>\\n<p>I gave it the same treatment, and the pin came free.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said, swiftly backing up, \\u201cDone.\\xa0 Push.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I very nearly stepped on the glass from the syringe, before arresting my movement.\\xa0 My leg and bare foot stayed up, and I caught my balance, tipping over, twisting, and then throwing myself at the desk with the still-spinning syringe on it, just to have something to grab.</p>\\n<p>Around that same moment, someone pushed on the door.\\xa0 Without the hinges, it simply tipped forward and fell onto the back of the bookcase.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle was there, wearing his uniform, including the black lab coat with a hood, and I spotted the red headed woman in the white lab coat, who I knew only as Lacey.\\xa0 Shapely, thirty or so, and wholly dedicated to her work.\\xa0 Unfortunately.\\xa0 I suspected the first-name-only was supposed to endear her to me, but it really didn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m glad you\\u2019re okay, Sy,\\u201d she said, her voice soft.\\xa0 Trying too hard to be gentle.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle picked his way past the door, stepping onto the back of the bookcase, apparently intent on surveying the damage.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir,\\u201d Lacey said, suddenly sounding concerned rather than gentle.</p>\\n<p>He turned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere were two glass cases in the room.\\xa0 They were inhabited.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle froze.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe snake and spiders?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re around here somewhere.\\xa0 <em>Something</em> was under the bed.\\xa0 It\\u2019s pretty close to you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey don\\u2019t concern you?\\u201d Mr. Hayle asked.</p>\\n<p>I shook my head, then wished I hadn\\u2019t.\\xa0 It made the general kicked-into-the-dirt pain in my head come back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t come any further then.\\xa0 If you\\u2019d find a shirt and come out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I collected my shirt from the bed and pulled it on.</p>\\n<p>All things considered, he seemed remarkably at ease over the damage I\\u2019d done.\\xa0 I wondered who the office belonged to.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWalk with me,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cDouglas, please listen to Lacey as she instructs you about putting the shelf back in place and catching the smaller animals.\\xa0 Lacey?\\xa0 Bring him to my office in the tower when you\\u2019re done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Lacey said.</p>\\n<p>She reached for me while I passed, and I jerked my shoulder to strike her hand away rather than let it rest on me in anything resembling reassurance.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle hadn\\u2019t missed it.</p>\\n<p>I buttoned up my shirt while we walked.\\xa0 I was wrinkled, my hair greasy and sticking out at the ends.\\xa0 I might have looked feral.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t like her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could tell you she\\u2019s a lovely, vibrant young lady, but that\\u2019s not the question, is it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t think so.\\xa0 Let it be what it is, then.\\xa0 Tell me, honestly, do you feel up to working?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m rarely honest,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen give me a convincing lie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, sir.\\xa0 If they need my help, I\\u2019ll give it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He frowned a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe night I dropped you off, I gave them a task.\\xa0 It is perhaps the most important job that the Lambsbridge project has been given.\\xa0 One only your particular group can do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d had my attention.\\xa0 Now he had my curiosity.</p>\\n<p>He probably knew me better than I was willing to admit, if he was getting to me this quickly.</p>\\n<p>That, or my defenses were down, and I was giving him more clues than I\\u2019d intended.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI positioned them at the Mothmont ladder school to investigate a problem, and they\\u2019ve run into a block.\\xa0 No forward progress.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I\\u2019d known I\\u2019d be going to school I don\\u2019t think I would have helped you move the door.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen let me tell you why you opened the door.\\xa0 Three weeks ago, a student at Mothmont killed his father, then himself.\\xa0 The victim was a Crown State Senator.\\xa0 Autopsies didn\\u2019t indicate any particular chemicals or abnormalities.\\xa0 Nine days ago, we had another incident.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnother Mothmont student.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He paused as we passed a pair of students in grey lab coats.\\xa0 Graduates.\\xa0 The red and silver of the Radham Academy crests they wore on their breasts were stark against the muted fabric.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHello, professor,\\u201d the girl of the pair greeted Mr. Hayle.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood morning, Heather, good morning, Daniel,\\u201d he replied.\\xa0 We continued walking.\\xa0 When they were out of earshot, he resumed his explanation.\\xa0 \\u201cA house burned with four individuals inside.\\xa0 Charred bodies of a lawyer, his wife, and his politician brother were autopsied, and trauma suggests they were cut with the intent of <em>disabling</em>, limiting their movements so they couldn\\u2019t escape the fire.\\xa0 Ankles, knees.\\xa0 The daughter of the lawyer was found in a separate room, a Mothmont student herself, but the cuts were different.\\xa0 A day later, there was a third incident.\\xa0 The day I appeared at Lambsbridge to talk to you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree makes a pattern.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe third incident saw the son murdering his father, grandfather, and mother, the father and grandfather were, again, prominent.\\xa0 Military.\\xa0 He set fire to the crime scene and sat in the midst of it to burn up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMethod?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeg pardon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was the murder weapon?\\xa0 Do they know?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe father and grandfather were killed with a sword that had hung over the mantlepiece, both were in their beds.\\xa0 The mortician believes the mother fled and tried to fight back.\\xa0 She had defensive wounds\\xa0 and a weapon of her own in hand.\\xa0 She lost the fight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She lost.\\xa0 That was interesting unto itself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re sending us after killer children,\\u201d I observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would call them assassins rather than killers.\\xa0 You understand the concern here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d reached the end of the hallway.\\xa0 Mr. Hayle opened a closet and retrieved my cloak and shoes from within.\\xa0 I started pulling my outdoor clothes on.\\xa0 \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t look good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, Sylvester, it doesn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Mothmont was made and supported by rich and powerful individuals with the premise that younger students would graduate from there and move on to the Academy.\\xa0 If they couldn\\u2019t pass the entrance exam, they would continue their studies at Mothmont until they could.\\xa0 Only the best in teachers, facilities, and students.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept for the parent murdering part,\\u201d I noted.</p>\\n<p>We began our way down.\\xa0 There were more students in the stairwell, four men clustered at one window, smoking, two women sitting on the stairs below.\\xa0 Both scooted over as we came down.</p>\\n<p>One of the women smiled at me as I descended.\\xa0 Twenty and beautiful and wearing a white lab coat that suggested she was still a student.\\xa0 Almost an older Helen without the Helen-ness.\\xa0 When I met her gaze, my expression flat, her smile dropped off her face.</p>\\n<p>Mr. Hayle spoke in a low voice, his head turned to make sure nobody above us was listening in as we continued down the spiral stairs.\\xa0 \\u201cBeing different tends to draw attention, whether it\\u2019s being inferior or being <em>superior</em>.\\xa0 Mothmont, being superior, has clearly fallen under someone\\u2019s eye.\\xa0 We would like this to stay out of the <em>public\\u2019s</em> eye.\\xa0 The only reason it hasn\\u2019t, I believe, is that the third incident happened halfway across the country.\\xa0 Given a fourth incident or time for rumors to spread\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026The cat would be out of the bag.\\xa0 I get it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t quite like any of the tasks I\\u2019ve given the Lambsbridge project, but it\\u2019s one I feel you\\u2019re suited for.\\xa0 That said, it is<em> sensitive, </em>Sylvester.\\xa0 Lives are on the line, the people who know and are paying attention <em>matter</em>, and the reactions if others found out could be disastrous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI get it,\\u201d I said, again.\\xa0 I knew I was more irritable.\\xa0 I had the information I\\u2019d wanted, and now I was finding myself slipping back to the point I\\u2019d been: feeling the ache in my head and resenting everything for existing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEach major department was given a share of funds to go toward major projects.\\xa0 Rather than devote my funds into <em>one</em> project, I devoted them to six very different projects.\\xa0 The plan was for the six to form a whole.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s unfortunate that only four of you proved viable, but you\\u2019ve turned out well, you each show more and more promise as you develop, but you remain one member of a unit.\\xa0 A <em>gestalt.\\xa0 </em>Your group is feeling your absence, and they feel it strongly enough that they went out of their way to ask for you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m touched,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t lying about that, but my thoughts were more on the fact that I\\u2019d get to rub it in their faces.\\xa0 They needed me.\\xa0 I could be smug about it.</p>\\n<p>We reached the first floor.\\xa0 He held the door for me, and we passed through, heading straight for an office.</p>\\n<p>The grey-coat doctor that had given me fresh skin greeted us, exchanging brief pleasantries with Mr. Hayle before getting down to brass tacks.\\xa0 I shouldn\\u2019t spend too long in the sun until a few weeks had passed.\\xa0 Never mind that the sun rarely showed its face around these parts.</p>\\n<p>My thoughts were already on the situation at Mothmont.\\xa0 I was a week behind the others, and time was already proving to be of the essence.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It wasn\\u2019t Mr. Hayle that dropped me off, but his student Lacey.\\xa0 One of three students assigned to <em>me</em>.\\xa0 It made for a very quiet, uncomfortable ride to Mothmont.\\xa0 I did my utmost to make it uncomfortable for her, glaring at her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">To her credit, she seemed to have difficulty meeting my eyes.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cProfessor Hayle suggested I take you to get your hair cut,\\u201d Lacey said, summoning some courage and meeting my gaze.\\xa0 \\u201cSo you\\u2019re more presentable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt isn\\u2019t long.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s long enough to get untidy very easily,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t take long.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSy-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, again.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t suggest it again.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a reason I want my hair like it is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d she said, raising her hands.\\xa0 \\u201cI understand.\\xa0 How about food?\\xa0 You barely ate at all after you locked yourself in the office.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI ate plenty,\\u201d I said, meeting her eyes.\\xa0 \\u201cYou didn\\u2019t find all the spiders that had been in the glass case, did you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She was stricken with a paralyzing sort of alarm at the idea.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She seemed to shake it off, and she managed a titter of a laugh. \\u201cYou\\u2019re messing with me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I looked out the window, and very casually remarked, \\u201cIt\\u2019s sort of disgusting when a woman as old as you are tries to giggle and act like a little girl.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I didn\\u2019t look at her to see her reaction.\\xa0 That would have taken away from the effect.\\xa0 My peripheral vision suggested she\\u2019d reacted as if I\\u2019d slapped her full-on in the face.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDon\\u2019t talk to me like we\\u2019re friends,\\u201d I said, still not looking at her.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m your <em>job</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou seem to have civil conversations with professor Hayle, Sy- Sylvester.\\u201d\\xa0 She\\u2019d switched to the long form of my name at the last second.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I met her eyes.\\xa0 \\u201cI <em>respect</em> him, if nothing else.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Three students had hands-on roles with the Wyvern project.\\xa0 With <em>me</em>.\\xa0 I had no idea how many were peripherally involved.\\xa0 Looking at Lacey, one of the three students, I couldn\\u2019t see any trace of a smile on her face.\\xa0 The look in her eyes was a mixture of dislike and <em>pity</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Pity.\\xa0 And she wondered why I hated her as much as I did?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI see,\\u201d Lacey said.\\xa0 \\u201cUnderstood.\\xa0 Can I ask-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I tensed a little, leaning forward with my hands on my knees, and I heard the hitch of hesitation in her voice.\\xa0 A momentary pause.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201c-Why now?\\u201d she finished.\\xa0 \\u201cI won\\u2019t say there haven\\u2019t been incidents in the past, but why are you suddenly taking issue with me <em>today</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou can ask,\\u201d I said, and I left the statement hanging.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She turned her head, looking out the window I\\u2019d been staring out of a moment ago.\\xa0 Apparently she wasn\\u2019t too surprised at the non-answer.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cEvery day for the last week, you knocked on the door, you tried to talk to me, to reassure, to offer food, sheets or clothes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd you wanted to be left alone?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI did, but that wasn\\u2019t it.\\xa0 Give a man a gun, tell him to shoot his neighbor or he gets shot.\\xa0 The first man we put in this situation does it without a care.\\xa0 He pulls the trigger.\\xa0 The second man cries and moans, he begs his neighbor for forgiveness, then he pulls the trigger.\\xa0 The third man cries and moans, begs for forgiveness, and pulls the trigger, and the fourth man takes a bullet because he won\\u2019t bring himself to do that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe second and third men are the same?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOh.\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 The first and second man went home and went to sleep and rested easy,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She worked through it aloud, summing up, \\u201cFirst shoots without a word, sleeps easy.\\xa0 Second man asks for forgiveness, shoots, sleeps easy.\\xa0 Third man asks for forgiveness, shoots, but doesn\\u2019t sleep.\\xa0 The fourth dies because he won\\u2019t shoot.\\xa0 You\\u2019re going to tell me the first man is the best of the four?\\u201d Lacey asked me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I gave her a disgusted look.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe third, then.\\xa0 You\\u2019re implying I\\u2019m the second?\\xa0 It\\u2019s a pretty massive, <em>incorrect</em> assumption on your part, Sylvester, if you think I sleep easy,\\u201d she said, and there was a touch of heat in her voice.\\xa0 I\\u2019d upset her a little.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, calm.\\xa0 \\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything about someone being better or worse.\\xa0 They can face the situation any way they want to.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve got a gun to their head, it\\u2019s their choice.\\xa0 You?\\xa0 Maybe you\\u2019re like the second man, maybe you\\u2019re like the third, but you definitely don\\u2019t have a gun to your head.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re being nice to me, it\\u2019s for your benefit, not mine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I leaned back, turning away from her, my attention returning to the window.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Human nature.\\xa0 If I\\u2019d simply said it, one line, one sentence, she wouldn\\u2019t have listened.\\xa0 But I\\u2019d gotten her thinking, pulled her in, and then forced her to face it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The remainder of the coach ride to Mothmont was blissfully silent.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mothmont turned out to be an interesting building.\\xa0 Four stories with a steep, slanted shingle roof, it took up a third of a city block, it had no yard that I could make out.\\xa0 The walls were eggshell pale, and the ivy that crawled across the brickwork was dark, almost leafless.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t in an end of town I\\u2019d frequented, but even among nicer buildings with gargoyles that spat out water from the gutters and built-in stables for stitched horses, it stood out as something <em>prominent</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A woman was waiting for me by the arching entrance that led into the building.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lacey didn\\u2019t say a word as I left the coach, pulling my hood up to shield off the rain.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester, I take it?\\u201d the woman asked.\\xa0 She was buxom, the word was, businesslike in a pink jacket and short dress, brown hair curled at the sides, with a touch too much makeup.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes ma\\u2019am.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have manners.\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 I\\u2019m the headmistress.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s have a look at you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I pulled down my hood.</p>\\n<p>Somehow she didn\\u2019t look particularly pleased.\\xa0 I was a little scruffy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome, inside,\\u201d she said, guiding me with a hand at my back.</p>\\n<p>She led me in past the front office, pointing me to the boy\\u2019s bathroom.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUniform on the chair by the sink.\\xa0 Take a moment to wash your face before getting dressed.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll bring you a comb so you can tidy your hair.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, and I did as she asked.</p>\\n<p>The uniform turned out to be white.\\xa0 White slacks and a button-up shirt with short sleeves and a straight, stiff-necked collar.\\xa0 The white of it was likely a nod to the Academy.</p>\\n<p>I hated white.\\xa0 I\\u2019d seen too much of it, and it didn\\u2019t suit.\\xa0 My hair was black, and even with grease or glue or whatever else I put into it, the ends would curl up and it would find a way to break loose.</p>\\n<p>I made myself as presentable as possible, knowing it wouldn\\u2019t last.</p>\\n<p>I stepped out of the bathroom and presented myself to the headmistress.\\xa0 She knelt before me and smoothed out some of the clothing, picking at one piece of lint.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt suits you,\\u201d she lied.\\xa0 \\u201cYou look like a young gentleman.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Two lies in two breaths, straight to my face.\\xa0 I almost liked her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s lunch time.\\xa0 You can introduce yourself to the others.\\xa0 The afternoon classes are all dedicated to biology.\\xa0 On Fridays, we visit the Academy.\\xa0 Now, a boy named Jamie was staying at the orphanage.\\xa0 Do you know him?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, ma\\u2019am.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll be in the same classes as him, and you\\u2019ll sleep in the same quarters.\\xa0 You should find him sitting under the tree in the yard, I think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not surprised.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is strictly temporary, you understand?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t want you to get your hopes up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI understand, ma\\u2019am,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She straightened, looking down at me.\\xa0 \\u201cMrs. Earles believes you might be motivated to try harder, seeing what we have to offer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think I will, ma\\u2019am,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo on, then,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I went.\\xa0 A woman stood by a gate, opening it to let me through.</p>\\n<p>The building formed a <em>square,</em> with the yard in the center, the precious pupils safe within.\\xa0 A glass was erected with trees grown to support it at the corners, keeping those beneath dry.\\xa0 The glass roof itself crawled with vines and small flowers.</p>\\n<p>Youths aged seven to fifteen were gathered within, many playing, or gathered in groups.\\xa0 Blankets were laid out here and there for them to sit on, so they wouldn\\u2019t get their uniforms dirty.</p>\\n<p>Just as the students of the Academy had possessed a refined, polished air, these students looked <em>proper</em>.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t take me long to find the others.\\xa0 Gordon was in the company of the boys, a larger group.\\xa0 Helen was among the girls.\\xa0 Jamie was under one of the trees at the perimeter, book and pen in his lap.\\xa0 He\\u2019d seen me before I saw him, and was on his feet in a moment.</p>\\n<p>Lillian, I found off to one side, with an obese girl and a taller, skinny, buck-toothed man who looked to be about fifteen.\\xa0 Gordon whistled, sharp, and got her attention.\\xa0 She quickly said her goodbye to her two friends.</p>\\n<p>We collected.</p>\\n<p>Gordon took one look at me, and I saw genuine worry in his eyes.\\xa0 \\u201cYou had an <em>appointment</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re supposed to be there for each other when it counts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou didn\\u2019t know it was coming.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t either,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAt least I don\\u2019t have to worry about it for another thirty days.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He looked unimpressed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re <em>intolerable </em>after an appointment,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll try to be intolerable in a useful way,\\u201d I answered.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s get down to it.\\xa0 I heard you got stuck.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait, before any of that, did you come alone?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cI got dropped off by Lacey.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Damn,</em>\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019d hoped Hayle would come too,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought he\\u2019d be more concerned at our lack of progress.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked between the two, confused.</p>\\n<p>Gordon frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cLook, we\\u2019re more than stuck, Sy.\\xa0 We\\u2019re in danger.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDanger?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey know who we are.\\xa0 They\\u2019re onto us,\\u201d Helen said, and her voice was soft and entirely unconcerned.\\xa0 That wasn\\u2019t to say there wasn\\u2019t cause for concern.\\xa0 It was just Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFive attempts on our lives in the last seven days,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd the way we figure it, that means they\\u2019re either very, very clever\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr rogue elements from the Academy,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTalk to us,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s hear your ideas, fresh eyes, before we start giving you reason for bias.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cKnowing what little I do, I don\\u2019t think the kids are killers.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re assassins, either.\\xa0 They\\u2019re <em>tools</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 The others were still.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe killings are steadily improving in quality.\\xa0 That suggests the kids are the weapons, and the killer is out there,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cand I think you know that already.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe do,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat you don\\u2019t know, and why I think you\\u2019re stuck, is that you\\u2019re too prone to patterns.\\xa0 You have your own way of doing things, but it\\u2019s too rigid, when your enemies are hiding in the shadows.\\xa0 You need to shake it up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have an idea how, I imagine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled.</p>\\n<p>The pain in my head was going away by the second.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/tooth-and-nail-7-6/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>An impact shook the city of Brechwell, dull and low, reverberating through the ground and up to the rooftops.\\xa0 In the wake of it, windows and doors continued to rattle and bang in their frames, adding an eerie note to the tail end of it.</p>\\n<p>The entire city seemed to go still.\\xa0 Birds taking shelter from the rain and the handful of soldiers on the street were all frozen.\\xa0 Our group and the rainwater were the only things moving in a still tableau.</p>\\n<p>Then the warning bells started tolling, muffled, all through the city, the birds took off from roosts, and soldiers ran.\\xa0 Where each of the towers had lone spotlights, additional lights were lit, the beams becoming diffuse, aimed at the city streets.\\xa0 Stretches of light and dark.</p>\\n<p><em>State of emergency</em>.</p>\\n<p>A second impact cut into the bass tolling of the bells.\\xa0 As it rippled across a segment of Brechwell, the bells were jarred midway through their motions.\\xa0 Some sounded early, others were delayed.</p>\\n<p>I gripped Lillian\\u2019s wrist harder as the rooftop shook with the strike.</p>\\n<p>The Brechwell Beast roared, and the sound carried.\\xa0 It was a lowing noise, and I imagined I imagined it sounded frustrated.\\xa0 An actual observation, gleaned from small details and intuition, or just what I wanted to think?</p>\\n<p><em>Wish they hadn\\u2019t warned people, but I guess they had to.</em><em>\\xa0 Someone in charge probably promised citizens there would be notice, to pacify them.</em></p>\\n<p>Down a side street, without a man or guard touching it, a portcullis gate slammed down, the blunted metal teeth of it striking the stone of the road.\\xa0 The lights from the towers shifted, leaving that street dark, illuminating the path that remained.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d imagined this part.</p>\\n<p>Release the local weapon, send it out into the streets, and use the gates to control its movements.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t stop smiling.</p>\\n<p>Helen, ahead of us, raised a hand, then gestured twice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cScreams,\\u201d Catcher said, echoing the same sentiment.\\xa0 \\u201cYour Ghosts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Here we were.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d never had the impression the Ghosts were particularly intelligent.\\xa0 They could talk, recite from script, and they had residual behaviors and movement from the manner of their manufacture.\\xa0 I wondered if the scenario of the Brechwell Beast had even come up, if the Firebrands had taken the time to explain to their inaudible children just what to expect and what to do if the weapon was let loose from its dwelling.</p>\\n<p>I heard the Beast roar, and this time it was moving.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d opened the gate it had been banging against.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCross!\\u201d Gordon shouted, pointing.\\xa0 It was a set of rooftops above a gate that still yawned open.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it passes beneath us-\\u201d Petey had to raise her voice to be heard over the din.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCross!\\u201d Gordon called out.</p>\\n<p>Helen ran across, hunched over, one hand extended straight toward the ground, ready to drop and hug the peaked roof at a moment\\u2019s notice.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary were next, followed by Lillian and me.</p>\\n<p>Dog, Catcher and the Engineer had gone ahead, and Dog had been kind enough to place his claws against sections further down the roof.\\xa0 I could see patches where he\\u2019d leaped and where he\\u2019d landed, and shingles had been torn or scraped away by the violence and the weight of each of his movements.</p>\\n<p>Petey was lagging behind.\\xa0 I made sure to keep an eye on her.\\xa0 By all rights, Helen should have gone with her, but Petey and Helen were diametric opposites, Helen was our scout, capable of hearing the Ghosts, and Petey was far from being fast enough to help with scouting.</p>\\n<p>We could have and should have reshuffled the group, perhaps sending Mary forward with Helen, but it was too late to decide on that now, and we were almost there.\\xa0 So long as Petey didn\\u2019t slip and slide off to one side and over the brink, we were fine.</p>\\n<p>Dog and Catcher stopped, and Catcher extended an arm, signaling.\\xa0 Catcher remembered the signals for alert, and for direction.\\xa0 Easy to make out in the gloom, as he was a dark silhouette against the glare of a tower\\u2019s lights.</p>\\n<p>I squeezed Lillian\\u2019s wrist, tugging her a bit as I willed her to move faster.</p>\\n<p>We were so close.</p>\\n<p>Over one house, past another, past an \\u2018x\\u2019 shaped intersection of rooftops and buildings, a park to one side and roads to another, and we could see what Catcher was indicating.</p>\\n<p>A trio of Ghosts and a quartet of others in civilian garb were all gathered, talking.\\xa0 Some had rifles.\\xa0 Infiltrators.</p>\\n<p>One Ghost was staring up at us.</p>\\n<p>I could feel the tramp of the Brechwell Beast\\u2019s feet, see the shift of the lighting as some lights moved to follow it.\\xa0 It was loud, and the sound went beyond the heavy footfalls.\\xa0 A grinding sound, like something heavy rolling over crushed stones.</p>\\n<p>The civilians were at a door, working to open it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCatcher!\\u201d I shouted, and my voice was nearly drowned out.</p>\\n<p>He said something, but I couldn\\u2019t make out the individual sounds.\\xa0 He was reaching into his coat, withdrawing something that was about the same size and shape as a wine bottle, but black with fluid inside.</p>\\n<p>He tossed it out over the edge of the roof.\\xa0 Ghosts scattered, backing up, while the other enemies in civilian clothing were oblivious.</p>\\n<p>The bottle struck hard ground, there was a flare of orange in the center, and then thick smoke filled the area.</p>\\n<p>He said something else that I couldn\\u2019t make out.</p>\\n<p>Each tromp of the Beast\\u2019s feet made my teeth clack together.\\xa0 He was one street over, rounding the corner behind us, turning, approaching the corner that turned onto <em>this</em> street.</p>\\n<p>Helen dropped, hugging the roof\\u2019s peak.</p>\\n<p>I tugged Lillian\\u2019s arm, hauling her down.\\xa0 I dug fingers beneath thick, wet, freezing shingles for a grip.\\xa0 Others were doing the same.</p>\\n<p>The superweapon of Brechwell Academy lunged \\u2019round the corner, not slowing, heedless of potential obstacles in its way.</p>\\n<p>Had someone taken a toad, a mammoth, a bull and a rhino and kept the most brutish features of each, they would have been in the right ballpark for the Brechwell Beast.\\xa0 It was wide, muscular, and built to plow forward, with no sign that it was built to stop.\\xa0 Its chest was triangular and deep enough to scrape the ground, even as powerful limbs carried it forward.\\xa0 Tusks extending from the corner of its mouth scraped against the road and the sides of buildings, the curve of them keeping them from catching on anything, and horns extended around the top, doing much the same.\\xa0 At the shoulder -the shoulders and upper parts of its forelimbs were perhaps its largest feature, I noted- it stood three and a half stories tall.</p>\\n<p>It was armored, something grown rather than hewn from metal, the plates white-gray in color, edges sharpened, layered over one another.\\xa0 The plates at the chest scraped the ground like the horns and tusks did, and the plates across its back gave it a serrated appearance.\\xa0 What I could see between and beneath armor plates suggested that the Beast had no lack of protection \\u2013 it alternated from layers of heavy scale that was probably armor unto itself and skin that looked like it was nothing but callus and scar tissue.</p>\\n<p>The street rumbled, windows threatening to rattle out of panes as the Beast made its approach, and I found the vibration of its movement threatening to tear my fingers from the shingles.</p>\\n<p>I knew I wasn\\u2019t going to be able to hang on before it was halfway down the street to us.</p>\\n<p>It reached the \\u2018u\\u2019 bend in the road, with us at the middle of the bend.\\xa0 Its full weight slammed against the building faces, and momentum carried the shock of the impact straight through to us.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t even sure what happened.\\xa0 In one moment, I was on the rooftop.\\xa0 Then it was like I\\u2019d been hit across face, neck, chest and stomach with a physical blow.\\xa0 In the next, I wasn\\u2019t touching <em>anything</em> solid.</p>\\n<p>A full second passed before my right shoulder scraped roof.\\xa0 My right foot and ass touched the roof next, and I had my bearings.\\xa0 A moment later, my backpack caught on the roof, and I started spiraling out, head going more <em>down</em>, feet more <em>up</em>.</p>\\n<p>I was halfway down the roof, sliding down faster than I could\\u2019ve run, and there was only an abyss below me, darker than the sky above.</p>\\n<p>My arms went out for traction, heels of my hand scraping against the rough texture of the shingles, and as I started to correct the spin, I brought one leg out, my pants leg and the flesh nearest the bone of my shin tearing on contact with the roof.</p>\\n<p>Belly down, more points of contact.\\xa0 I was hugging the roof, trying not to do anything that would make me spin and keep the momentum going through another venue.\\xa0 Three quarters of the way down.</p>\\n<p>In the engulfing darkness below, I could see a vague shape in gray, lit indirectly by the fire around a distant burning building, bounced off a cloud and down into the shadows beneath me.</p>\\n<p>A tree, but one too distant to reach with a timely leap, let alone a skid and fall.</p>\\n<p>The flare of hope died, but in its place I managed rage and fury.</p>\\n<p><em>I will not die here!</em></p>\\n<p><em>\\u2018Oh, I knew Sy would do himself in eventually.\\u2019</em></p>\\n<p><em>I will not let them make remarks about how I was hoist by my own petard!</em></p>\\n<p>I shifted my weight.\\xa0 Seconds away from going over the edge, I raised both feet and stuck one arm out, no longer trying to slow my descent.\\xa0 I\\u2019d slowed, but it would never be enough, even if the roof was dry, if I wasn\\u2019t wearing a damn raincoat.</p>\\n<p>There was no light here, nothing to hint or illuminate my situation as I reached the end.\\xa0 I reached into darkness, slamming my feet down at an angle.</p>\\n<p>My feet found the gutter, wedging into the space.\\xa0 My tired, cold fingers found the edge of it, too.\\xa0 Momentum carried me down and forward, and my shoes popped out of the gutter, kicking shingle on the way up and out.\\xa0 A flap caught the meager light as it flew through the air, joined by one of my shoes.</p>\\n<p>I grit my teeth, bracing myself, as my lower body swung down, all of my weight jerking hard my fingers hard against the edge of the gutter, a wooden trough nailed to the eaves.\\xa0 I heard wood and metal cry out in their individual ways, threatening to pull free of where it had been secured to the wall.</p>\\n<p>My other hand went up, punching skyward in an effort to reach high enough, and found a grip.</p>\\n<p>Panting, hurting in a dozen places, I stayed right where I was, and found enough breath to whistle.</p>\\n<p>I could feel the Brechwell Beast continuing on its way, rounding a corner, then passing somewhere to my right.\\xa0 Each movement jarred me, and made the water that sat at the bottom of the gutter splash out, spattering me.</p>\\n<p>Catcher appeared in my view, mancatcher in one hand, touching the roof, the other extended out for balance, feet spread wide.\\xa0 He eased his way down to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou could have lost the pack,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cShrug your shoulders, let it fall.\\xa0 That has to be a solid stone of weight weighing you down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHeavier.\\xa0 It\\u2019s all books.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoint stands.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m okay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf it really came down to it, I\\u2019d let him fall.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHim?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt.\\xa0 The bag.\\xa0 Let me up, will you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm.\\xa0 Take this,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand don\\u2019t haul me down over the edge.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He extended his poke, the spiked mancatcher end, and I shifted my grip to one arm, the entire arm and hand trembling as I reached up and through the closed metal ring to grip the pole just beyond.</p>\\n<p>I had to passively let him haul me up and over, because planting a foot on the edge and pulling myself <em>up</em> threatened to pull him down at the same time.\\xa0 Once I was high enough, I found a foothold in the gutter.\\xa0 A moment later I had one hand and both feet on the roof.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEveryone okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 I had to save Lillian before I saved you.\\xa0 I got her before she fell as far as you did, and she fell the other way.\\xa0 Dog got Petey.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gave me a simple nod.</p>\\n<p>I kept one hand on the mancatcher as we made our way to the peak.</p>\\n<p>The bells continued to toll as we rejoined the others.\\xa0 I reached out with my less-sore left hand and took Lillian\\u2019s, noting how her hair was sticking up on one side.\\xa0 She had a bit of a scrape too, and it looked like her ear was bleeding.</p>\\n<p>I looked down at the street where Catcher had created the cloud of smoke.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t look like they\\u2019d gotten the door open.\\xa0 There was carnage, a body severed in half, no doubt sandwiched between wall and a sweeping tusk, and the lower body wasn\\u2019t visible or distinguishable.\\xa0 There were meaty bits amid the streak of flesh and blood, too ruined for me to tell what it was supposed to be.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNext time,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cWe position better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, then I smiled, \\u201cIt has to have reached them by now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood to walk?\\u201d he asked, glancing at one of my legs.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>We made our way in the direction we\\u2019d estimated Fray\\u2019s meeting spot to be.\\xa0 As we walked, I pulled my raincoat off, freeing one arm from sleeve and strap of backpack before letting go of Lillian\\u2019s hand and doing the same with the other.\\xa0 I let the raincoat fall to the roof before pulling the pack on again.</p>\\n<p>There was a crash a few streets over.\\xa0 A plume of dust or smoke rose from the impact site.</p>\\n<p>Dog huffed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGoing ahead,\\u201d Catcher said, as he increased his pace.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t fall again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The streets below us were getting wider, and I realized we were approaching the city center.\\xa0 There were a few more patches of gore where the Beast had torn past bystanders, but less than I might have liked.</p>\\n<p>We crossed a bridge and another section of rooftops, and reached the base of another tower, overlooking a plaza.\\xa0 It was an open area like we\\u2019d seen in the Academy, broken up by patterns in how the road was drawn out, with gardens in the spaces between the individual footpaths and a fountain in the center, set low to the ground.\\xa0 The Beast\\u2019s tusk had already torn through two opposing walls of the fountain, and a foot might have crushed another.\\xa0 Destroyed wagons and stalls littered the area already.</p>\\n<p>There was a building that might have been a town hall, a hospital, and another set of larger buildings I couldn\\u2019t label.\\xa0 The Beast was here, with freedom to move as it pleased.\\xa0\\xa0 The white of the thing\\u2019s tusks was stained with mud, debris and gore.\\xa0 Its eyes were dark compared to the mask it had been fitted with.</p>\\n<p>Objectively, it was beautiful.\\xa0 Now that it wasn\\u2019t charging right for me, I could see the patterns on the armor, a mingling of old damage that had been left alone rather than repaired, and decorative etchings.\\xa0 Rainwater ran down the armor, pausing and helping catch the light amid the etchings.\\xa0 It looked like the lines of a maze.</p>\\n<p>Rifles fired from windows, and I suspected they might have been exorcists.\\xa0 The Beast was too far away, and the rifles, as powerful as they were, were far too little to stop the Beast, even if they got past the armor.</p>\\n<p>But the noise and the patter of bullets against armor did get the creature\\u2019s attention.\\xa0 It turned, focused on the source, and then charged from across the plaza.</p>\\n<p>I imagined the people inside the building were doing much what we were.\\xa0 Though we weren\\u2019t the target, we scrambled to put distance between ourselves and the impact site.</p>\\n<p>The Beast\\u2019s tusks retracted.\\xa0 Horns didn\\u2019t, but it lowered its head so the points of the horns were aimed almost straight down.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t have a neck, only muscle and shoulder, and thus served as a massive battering ram, nearly as tall and far stronger than the building it assaulted.</p>\\n<p>We had a fair distance, but I still lowered myself, pulling off the pack, and braced for impact.</p>\\n<p>The <em>crack</em> of it made my thoughts skip, and the impact resounded, distorting the regular rhythm of bells.\\xa0 My vision jolted, and the fact that people manning nearby lights at the towers were jarred as well made the entire scene seem to wobble.\\xa0 The stone could have taken cannon fire and withstood it.\\xa0 The Beast didn\\u2019t care.\\xa0 It slammed through a foot of stone blocks with as much ease as Dog might a wooden door, plunging head and shoulders into the building.</p>\\n<p>Forelimbs reached up, scrabbling for purchase, and its shoulders heaved upwards against yet-unbroken stone, splitting it and sending it sliding down either side of the Beast\\u2019s back.\\xa0 The feet were reaching up to the first floor, straining to reach the second, and tore the floors down and away instead.</p>\\n<p>Huffing, puffing, the superweapon bucked, horns spearing up, striking at the floor above and the exterior wall, bringing more debris down.</p>\\n<p>I doubted anyone inside had survived that.\\xa0 Tough luck to anyone who lived upstairs or downstairs from that particular group.</p>\\n<p>It tried to retreat out, and its horns snagged on the stone masonry.\\xa0 It was a hair away from breaking the stone, but it didn\\u2019t haul itself free.\\xa0 Instead, the Beast remained where it was, huffing, puffing.\\xa0 Then it yawned, with no air entering or leaving its mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCover your nose and mouth!\\u201d Lillian shrieked. \\xa0 Then, in her haste to follow through with her own action, she got out another incomplete phrase, \\u201cEyes!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I allowed myself a peek as I tucked nose and mouth into the crook of my elbow, lowering myself.</p>\\n<p>The Beast was letting a dark fog creep out of its mouth, filling the cavity of the ruined building in front of it.</p>\\n<p>The fog wasn\\u2019t reaching us.</p>\\n<p>I started to lower my arm.\\xa0 Lillian reached over and jerked it back up into place.</p>\\n<p>Something flickered.\\xa0 Like tentacles snaking through the dark fog, fire reached out.\\xa0 I brought my other arm up to protect my eyes as the fire expanded to find other pockets that would ignite, then others, swelling-</p>\\n<p>Our position on the far side of the roof, with the roof\\u2019s peak between us and the Beast prevented the worst of the detonation from reaching us.\\xa0 Everything else was silenced by the <em>crack</em>, even Beast and warning bells, and then, as if all of the sound had been caught up and thrown our way, it rushed at us, a violent wind and torrent of noise.\\xa0 I could hear glass breaking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t breathe!\\u201d Lillian called out, voice muffled.\\xa0 It sounded like her voice was strained, as if she was digging for the last scraps of air in her lungs to give the order.</p>\\n<p>I remained where I was, face buried in the crooks of my elbows, hunched over the peak of the roof.</p>\\n<p>I felt my thoughts start to waver, my vision going dark at the edges, as my lungs burned of a need for more oxygen.\\xa0 The bells were resuming, and the deep thuds of the Beast\\u2019s footsteps shook the building and vibrated in the core of me, straining my already tenuous control over my struggling lungs and throat.</p>\\n<p>But when a doctor-in-training said not to breathe, one listened.\\xa0 When they ran, one ran.\\xa0 When they said \\u2018oh shit\\u2019, one ran and held their breath at the same time.</p>\\n<p>I was so focused on the singular act of fighting every bodily impulse that I didn\\u2019t fully understand what I was hearing as someone heaved in a breath.\\xa0 I registered, and chanced opening my eyes.\\xa0 Lillian had her mouth covered, but her eyes were open.\\xa0 She stared into my eyes.</p>\\n<p>Three seconds passed.</p>\\n<p>Then she took in a breath.</p>\\n<p>I allowed myself to breathe, joined by others.\\xa0 We got our wind, and watched as the Beast assaulted another, shorter building, trampling it to the ground.</p>\\n<p>I looked over my shoulder at the building it had already attacked.\\xa0 The back end had blown out, and parts had collapsed.\\xa0 Absolutely nothing still lived there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEveryone okay?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>There were nods all around.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe gas,\\u201d Petey said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat is it?\\xa0 I might have breathed some in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably a nerve gas,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf he\\u2019s about twenty years old, then he\\u2019s part of the Wynn generation of warbeasts.\\xa0 A lot of them made their own from internal waste and byproducts.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve read up on it, a little extra because Ibott said he was thinking about giving Helen a reserve.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was a no,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re probably immune, by the way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNeat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat would happen if we breathed it in?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAt this distance, that concentration, carried by the explosion?\\xa0 Probably nothing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly probably.\\xa0 But if you were unlucky, your throat might stop working, or it wouldn\\u2019t work as well, or you\\u2019d lose some function in your eyes.\\xa0 If we weren\\u2019t wearing clothes, we might lose sphincter control.\\xa0 Maybe bladder control, for the girls.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot the guys?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to get into anatomy 101, Sy,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cDoesn\\u2019t matter anyway, unless you\\u2019re taking your pants off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t tempt him,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey!\\u201d I protested, to Mary.\\xa0 Then to Lillian, I said, \\u201cAnd it does too matter, I like my sphincter control.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re all glad for your sphincter control,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019d be more unpleasant to be around if you didn\\u2019t have any.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>More</em> unpleasant?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnough,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cLook.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Brechwell Beast was taking a side road.\\xa0 The lights were leading it on its way.</p>\\n<p>I raised myself up and pulled my clammy shirt away from my chest, trying to make heads or tails of the runny lines there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s headed in the right direction,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, good,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou got the distraction you wanted.\\xa0 They\\u2019re probably quaking in their boots,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow what?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe follow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhile we\\u2019re doing that, let\\u2019s keep an eye out for one of those rifles.\\xa0 If it can hurt the Brechwell Beast, I wouldn\\u2019t mind having one for myself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 The wreckage of the building would be too much trouble to go through.</p>\\n<p>The Engineer and Petey stared.\\xa0 Petey was especially quiet right now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey open and close the gates, to control which routes the Beast can and will travel. It prefers lit area, I guess?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t most of us?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoint.\\xa0 It reaches the area we mentioned to the Wry Man, and then, what, they shut the gates and trap it and our enemies in the same space?\\xa0 They hide indoors and\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon said, \\u201cPresumably, the Brechwell Beast pulls the same trick it just did.\\xa0 Fills the area with gas, then ignites it.\\xa0 Nerve gas finishes off those the fire doesn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I thought of how the horns had caught.\\xa0 \\u201cIf it\\u2019s trapped.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cIs that okay?\\xa0 Percy might be with them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She flinched visibly at the mention of the name.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d rather get him alive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause if we didn\\u2019t, I wouldn\\u2019t be able to believe he wasn\\u2019t a clone, that this wasn\\u2019t a trick.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve thought about it a lot.\\xa0 The Percy thing,\\u201d she said, her voice quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cI know how it looks and sounds.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe trust you,\\u201d Lillian jumped in.\\xa0 \\u201cOr I do, at least.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do too,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI believe you.\\xa0 I think you\\u2019re right.\\xa0 Though you just put a nasty thought in my head.\\xa0 I\\u2019d really hate to find out that the corpse of Fray was a clone, and that the real her was running around somewhere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou might be getting ahead of yourself a little,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore than a little,\\u201d I admitted. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We rounded the perimeter of the oval plaza, picking our way carefully over the portion of roof that was still intact over the ruined, fire-charred stonework.\\xa0 Helen, Mary and I went first, verifying that the ground was steady, before the others.\\xa0 Petey was heavy and the Engineer was heavier still.\\xa0 The dense, hefty body of the machine man was on the most precarious point of a stretch with nothing but thick wooden beams when a somewhat distant impact rocked the city.\\xa0 He wobbled, found his balance, and hopped to safer ground.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s there,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cFray\\u2019s area.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou sure?\\u201d\\xa0 Petey asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure as dammit,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>A moment after he\\u2019d finished speaking, there was a flicker of fire.\\xa0 It took a full second for the rumble of the shockwave to sweep past us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo soon?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said, under his breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\xa0 Fray\\u2019s doing?\\xa0 She\\u2019s blowing it up?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He pointed.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I\\u2019m right\\u2026 then the Beast is there\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He moved his finger.\\xa0 \\u201cThe explosion-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Another explosion occurred, this one close enough that I could get a sense of the particulars, that it was more than one thing detonating in close succession, in two very close-by locations.\\xa0 There was another.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s finger moved each time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cScreams,\\u201d Helen said, \\u201cSome nearby.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a signal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDown!\\u201d he shouted.</p>\\n<p>We got down.</p>\\n<p>The remainder of the explosions sounded.\\xa0 There was one at the north end of the plaza.</p>\\n<p><em>They were hiding indoors.\\xa0 They had access to buildings</em>.\\xa0 <em>Fray\\u2019s people are scattered around the area, some on watch, waiting in windows with rifles in hand\\u2026 but they\\u2019re also guarding something</em>.</p>\\n<p>Caches.</p>\\n<p>I could see the damage at the north end.\\xa0 The front and back faces of the building were ruined.\\xa0 The floor was intact, but light did shine through.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFray\\u2019s making her move,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t understand,\\u201d Petey said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s freed the Beast of Brechwell,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, not free, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUnleashed,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p><em>They can\\u2019t use the gates to steer it anymore.\\xa0 It won\\u2019t be trapped.\\xa0 Fray has an escape route, and the Beast\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p><em>\\u2026Brechwell belongs to the Beast, for now</em>.</p>\\n<p>I smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on, and <em>hurry</em>,\\u201d I said, talking through the grin.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s given her response, and we\\u2019re still ahead.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve just got to take advantage before she gets away.\\xa0 We can get her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/29/tooth-and-nail-7-5/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Dog, Catcher and the Engineer were able to pull ahead, as much by virtue of their sheer speed as the fact that they had a straighter road.\\xa0 The trio of them were waiting for us at the base of one of the towers that overlooked a bend in the road.\\xa0 The spotlight swept over us as we approached, then moved on.</p>\\n<p>As we came to a stop, I let go of Lillian\\u2019s hand.\\xa0 I paced a bit, waiting for the stragglers, Petey, to catch up.\\xa0 Disgusted with the state of things, I screwed up my face and spat over the edge, the little wad of spit joining thousands of individual raindrops.</p>\\n<p>The Engineer watched us.\\xa0 His skin was as raw as a fresh burn, but he wore a mask that covered and sealed his mouth shut, a loose-fitting and incomplete metal shell surrounding much of his body.\\xa0 Mechanical parts were worked into biology, open enough that I could see wet muscle and turning cogs.\\xa0 It was a similar sort of project to Dog, I expected, but instead of going the warbeast route, they\\u2019d enhanced the man until things broke down, and they\\u2019d replaced the broken-down parts with machinery.\\xa0 I had little doubt that there was at least one machine attached to his body that dispensed powerful painkillers at regular intervals.</p>\\n<p>All that said, looking past the glistening bits I could see between gaps in the heavy armor, the Engineer was a work of art.\\xa0 The mask had a flair to it, the machinery gleamed, and there were traces of silver lining the edges of darker metal.\\xa0 Even his gun looked impressive and ornate.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re not following us anymore,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m pretty sure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Catcher looked at Dog, who shook his overlarge head.\\xa0 \\u201cDog doesn\\u2019t think so either.\\xa0 Tell me, what happened?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe had them cornered, and then they came out of the woodwork.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThese Ghosts are getting on my nerves,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDealing with them alone, we\\u2019ve shown we can do that, but apparently our enemies have the scariest bastards around working under them?\\xa0 We have to deal with the lot at once?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe saw some of them, too.\\xa0 Hitmen, thugs for hire,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cA couple of the most wanted in the Crown States.\\xa0 We couldn\\u2019t close in on them.\\xa0 Each of them had escorts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to stay unnoticed when you\\u2019re as ugly as some of those bastards are,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow are they infiltrating this city?\\xa0 Checkpoints, standing guards, patrols, any one of those guys should have raised alarm bells.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSecret routes?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t think, with how the city is put together,\\u201d the Wry Man said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded in agreement.\\xa0 \\u201cThey wouldn\\u2019t have security holes like that and not guard them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLeaves only one option,\\u201d Mary spoke.\\xa0 Gordon was already nodding beside her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInfiltration,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cA group of students, a commanding officer, or an entire faction within this city is working with our enemy.\\xa0 Say what you will about the Academy, it has its strengths, but engendering loyalty isn\\u2019t one of them.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not a problem when we\\u2019re winning, but when people see opportunity, they don\\u2019t exactly feel bad about taking action against the Academy, or twisting their perspective around to justify making some money or getting some power at the Academy\\u2019s expense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a curious look, then said, \\u201cYeah, something to watch out for.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t talk about this with anyone until we find out more.\\xa0 If we tip them off before we have proof or leverage, we\\u2019re suddenly going to find that it\\u2019s very hard to get anything done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were nods all around.</p>\\n<p><em>Can\\u2019t trust the locals.\\xa0 Meaning we\\u2019re even more outnumbered.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did you discover?\\u201d Catcher asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe waited for them, and then we went looking.\\xa0 The blonde one-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-can hear the screeching, like you can.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m aware.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d the Wry Man said.\\xa0 \\u201cShould we head back, regroup, figure out where we\\u2019re sleeping tonight?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat is it, Sy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to double back,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe have the entire night head of us, we\\u2019re not going to accomplish anything by going back home.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have a job to do,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not disagreeing, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you summed it up.\\xa0 They have Ghosts.\\xa0 We can disrupt them, make noise that bothers them, but all reports suggest they\\u2019ve adapted to that trick, and we\\u2019d still be broadcasting our location.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t sneak up and observe or try to follow them without them knowing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe <em>can</em>,\\u201d I said, \\u201cbut we don\\u2019t know how, yet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSame thing,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf one group made a distraction while the other circled around,\\u201d I mused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d the Wry Man said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s suicidal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Petey cut in, \\u201cThis might be the time to mention that our friend here is very experienced at the trade.\\xa0 He\\u2019s been at it for-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThirty years,\\u201d the old man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThirty years,\\u201d Petey said, in that high voice of hers.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s\\u2026 wary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat is not a word I people tend to associate with me,\\u201d the Wry Man said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I won\\u2019t throw my life away for this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 Was this where different mentalities, personality types and approaches all clashed?\\xa0 Herding the Lambs was difficult enough.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow do you prefer to operate?\\u201d Gordon asked Petey.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m reckless by nature.\\xa0 Every time I make a move, I\\u2019m taking a risk,\\u201d Petey said.</p>\\n<p>A reckless undercover agent?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan we help?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Petey said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI always thought you should be a Lamb,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>Petey looked at our group, turning her head to look us over.\\xa0 A group of dripping children and a soggy dog.\\xa0 \\u201cIt looks exhausting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet us show you how much we can help you,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat you\\u2019d get, if you were one of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Petey sighed.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen we use Petey,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe go after them, bait them out-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ll run,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen we catch them,\\u201d Helen said, as if it was the simplest thing in the world.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey have the advantage on raw information,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they think they can win, then they\\u2019ll hit us with an unreasonable amount of force.\\xa0 If they don\\u2019t think they can win, they flee.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The pair of them stopped.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s ignore that part, or we\\u2019ll keep arguing in circles until the sun rises.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Sy</em> being the level headed one?\\u201d Lillian commented.</p>\\n<p>I stuck my finger out, pressing it against her lips.\\xa0 \\u201cShush.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She slapped my hand away.</p>\\n<p>The rain ran through my hair, and I pushed my fingers through it to get it back out of my face.\\xa0 I pointed at the Lambs, \\u201cStay,\\u201d pointed at the Wry Man, Engineer and Petey, \\u201cstay,\\u201d and pointed at Dog and Catcher, \\u201cwait here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A glance skyward told me the spotlight in the tower well above us was glowing, moving over the streets and rooftops.</p>\\n<p>I crossed the roof and grabbed the ladder.\\xa0 I started climbing, making my way up.</p>\\n<p>I was only part of the way up when a light touched me.\\xa0 It flickered for a moment as it settled on me, the living battery skipping a beat.</p>\\n<p>Still on the ladder, I stuck my arms out to either side, showing my empty hands.</p>\\n<p>The light moved to the others.\\xa0 The Wry Man raised a hand, apparently the signal that all was well.\\xa0 He was a known element, clearly.</p>\\n<p>I remembered what we\\u2019d said about trustworthy and untrustworthy elements, that there were far too many people who had critical positions in the Academy and very little loyalty to the institution.</p>\\n<p>I knew full well that I could drive myself crazy questioning every ally we had, but it would do to remember that these three strangers were just that, strangers.\\xa0 Whatever Helen was spouting off to Petey, it was hard enough to imagine adding two new Lambs to the group that I couldn\\u2019t bring myself to extend my trust to these people.</p>\\n<p>Solo operators, very good at what they did, but there was no guarantee someone else hadn\\u2019t reached them first with a better offer.</p>\\n<p>What did a Wry Man want out of existence, after thirty years of working under the Academy?</p>\\n<p>I continued making my way up the ladder.\\xa0 The light fell on me again, then moved up to the tower top above me, streaming into the room there.\\xa0 The light flicked off, on, off, and on again.</p>\\n<p>I pulled out my badge as I neared the top, and I banged my hand on the hatch.\\xa0 I was working under the assumption that, even if the soldiers in here were working with our enemy on some level, they weren\\u2019t going to blow their cover or take a risk by attacking me here.</p>\\n<p>The hatch opened.\\xa0 I was greeted by the sight of a weight overhead and men with rifles aiming at me.\\xa0 Young men, students only five or so years older than me, but men all the same.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you have a map?\\u201d I asked, in my best \\u2018innocent\\u2019 voice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is no place for children,\\u201d one of the men said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd there\\u2019s a curfew, no less.\\xa0 Climb up, unless you want us to help you on your way down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The blade of the bayonet touched my shoulder, suggesting just how he\\u2019d \\u2018help\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd keep your hands where we can see them,\\u201d another told me.</p>\\n<p><em>This is why people don\\u2019t like the Academy</em>.</p>\\n<p>I climbed up, and held my hands out as they frisked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTake a look through the hatch,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOn the roof beneath you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDog and Catcher?\\xa0 We were told about them, we saw them coming.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEveryone,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot just those two.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>One of the men stepped past me, peering down and over to see the group.</p>\\n<p>Catcher raised his free hand in a kind of wave.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey need a map,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s semi-urgent.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>One of the officers crossed the room, \\u201cWhat kind?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>So helpful.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf the city.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRestricted,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cMaps can\\u2019t leave this room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Of course it is.\\xa0 </em></p>\\n<p>A city designed to be a maze, to make effectively attacking it as difficult a process as possible.\\xa0 Letting maps of the layout out to possibly find their way to enemy hands was a security risk.</p>\\n<p>Except our enemies included Ghosts, who had a powerful sense of spatial awareness.\\xa0 In this particular circumstance, it was more trouble to friend than foe.</p>\\n<p>Brechwell\\u2019s leadership at work, in a way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan I see, at least?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>He gestured.\\xa0 I approached the counter with maps laid across it.\\xa0 They covered different neighborhoods, included full views of the city, topographic views, and views of the region, with symbols to mark the most likely avenues for entry.\\xa0 There were maps that were more legend than actual map, with lists of names.\\xa0 Probably families in a given range of streets.</p>\\n<p>The <em>really</em> interesting one had details on switches for the portcullis gates throughout the city.\\xa0 <em>If we could only get access to those controls, they\\u2019d have no chance</em>.\\xa0 <em>But our enemy is likely thinking something very similar.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are wanted criminals in this city, they set fire to Brechwell Academy earlier tonight,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYup,\\u201d one of the soldiers said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re camped out elsewhere in the city.\\xa0 We ran into a bunch of them just now, right here.\\u201d\\xa0 I touched the map.\\xa0 I was developing a story in my head.\\xa0 \\u201cWe saw some bad people, and I was told to come here and get a map so we could say where.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d the soldier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you have a sheet of paper?\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want to draw on your nice maps.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou most certainly don\\u2019t,\\u201d another soldier said, gruff.\\xa0 \\u201cBut we do have paper for you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrying to figure out where they might be based,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I pulled my raincoat off, draping it on the edge of the counter, and rolled up my sleeves.\\xa0 \\u201cInk, pen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>They slid a pen and some ink across the length of the counter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t take this with me, huh?\\u201d I asked, as I took offered paper, placed it over the map, and began to trace the most essential sections.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t.\\xa0 No maps leave.\\xa0 That means maps you draw.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I made a face.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll have to do my best, then.\\xa0 But getting it out of my head and on paper will help.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I won\\u2019t remember, it won\\u2019t help at all.</em></p>\\n<p>I sketched out the Academy, and then drew lines for the major roads and rivers.\\xa0 I circled the area where I assumed we\\u2019d seen the gathering.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny idea what neighborhood this is?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSixty-second.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed.\\xa0 Couldn\\u2019t even be a memorable thing.\\xa0 Any numbers would slip out of my head before I was halfway down the ladder.</p>\\n<p>I finished tracing out more of the city.\\xa0 As I drew, I moved my hand down the pen, which wasn\\u2019t hard.\\xa0 Pressure on the end of the fountain pen produced more ink, and it got ink all over my finger.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think I\\u2019ve got it.\\xa0 If I send them up here to see, can you show them?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d one of the men said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUgh, I\\u2019m bad with pens,\\u201d I said, shaking my hand.\\xa0 The blob of ink that covered the end of my finger spattered against the window and dotted a few of the maps.\\xa0 \\u201cOh, <em>shit</em>!\\xa0 Sorry!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Injecting just enough of a sense of alarm that they might think something was <em>really</em> wrong.\\xa0 I could see a half-dozen ways to play out this situation, but if I got them anxious-</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did you do!?\\u201d one man shouted.\\xa0 He rushed closer, hurrying to see if there was any damage to the maps.</p>\\n<p>I took the opportunity to hug my completed maps against my own chest, running my forearms down the length of them.\\xa0 I let them fall to the ground, snatching up my raincoat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid he do any damage?\\xa0 If we get in trouble for this-\\u201d one was saying.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFucking little kid, shouldn\\u2019t have given him ink,\\u201d another said.</p>\\n<p>I pulled my raincoat on as quickly as I could, trying to look as guilty and upset as possible, to deflect attention from what I was actually <em>doing</em>.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t- please don\\u2019t throw me down the hatch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>One gave me a look, annoyed.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to do that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said you would earlier, please\\u2026\\xa0 Just let me go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo,\\u201d was the order.</p>\\n<p>I left, down through the hatch, observed by one while two fussed over the maps and the trouble they\\u2019d get from their superiors if they were decided to be at fault.</p>\\n<p>Partway down the ladder, I reached fingers through the rungs of the ladder, and drew an \\u2018x\\u2019 on the knuckle of my thumb, just a short distance from Melancholy\\u2019s ring.</p>\\n<p>Hopefully that would be a reminder.\\xa0 They\\u2019d been nice enough, all things considered.\\xa0 Wouldn\\u2019t do to get them in trouble.</p>\\n<p>Jamie wouldn\\u2019t have.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTaking your sweet time?\\u201d Catcher called up to me, as I made my way to the rooftop again.</p>\\n<p>I walked around the point where the rooftop met the tower until I found a position where the tower\\u2019s bulk blocked the incoming rain.\\xa0 I pulled off my raincoat, then pulled off my shirt.\\xa0 I held it up.\\xa0 Excess ink had translated to the shirt, and though some of it had bled into the fabric, expanding out into fatter lines, and some of the finer details had dried too quickly to translate, the general image of the city was there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave to mentally flip it left to right,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t see, needs to be higher,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I raised it up..</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHigher.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I raised it as high as I could.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHigher.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I realized what he was doing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a dirty buttplug, Gordon,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you\\u2019re short,\\u201d he told me.</p>\\n<p>The Engineer reached forward and took the shirt, holding it flush against the tower wall.</p>\\n<p>I shivered a bit, shirtless, but still proud of my handiwork.\\xa0 I dabbed a bit of moisture on the wall and touched the spot I\\u2019d already marked with my ink-wet fingertip.\\xa0 I left a faint blue mark across the cloth, thin and dark at first, then fading as I applied more pressure and applied more of my finger.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe drug-takers, had guns, sixty-somethingth neighborhood, approaching from the southwest, I guess?\\xa0 And the strong men, led by one of our Most Wanted, along with creepy lady with the flowing dress, and the warbeast tamer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGhosts,\\u201d Gordon said, drawing his finger along the road I\\u2019d sketched out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore Ghosts,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 He touched the shirt, and his fingerprint came away a muddy yellow-black.</p>\\n<p>I glanced at him.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere\\u2019d you get ink?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWeapon oil,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I smiled.\\xa0 I liked improvisation when I saw it.</p>\\n<p>The Engineer moved one hand and tapped the shirt.\\xa0 Catcher marked the spot.\\xa0 \\u201cRifleman at a perch here, ducked out of sight when the searchlight swept his way.\\xa0 Saw us, and hid.\\xa0 Didn\\u2019t see him again.\\xa0 And here, strange looking stitched sitting outside in the rain.\\xa0 And here is where we lost the Ghosts we were chasing after the Academy fire\\u2026.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The dots and lines and marks were starting to form a picture.\\xa0 It was shaped like a wobbly crescent moon.\\xa0 An unfinished picture.</p>\\n<p>I touched the center of the incomplete circle.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was no answer but the patter of rain.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey are?\\u201d Lillian guessed.\\xa0 \\u201cThe bad guys?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I traced my finger around the circle\\u2019s rim.\\xa0 \\u201cDefensive perimeter.\\xa0 And in the center there, we have critical figures.\\xa0 Wanted men, leaders of different factions of rebellion.\\xa0 Mauer.\\xa0 Maybe Fray.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I glanced at Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPercy,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s possible,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut Fray has outsmarted us before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe factions have been fighting for months.\\xa0 Over three nights, they\\u2019ve banded together.\\xa0 Either they\\u2019ve reached an accord or they\\u2019re getting there,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen things are that tentative, are you really going to get complicated and take risks with how you station your guards?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cActually\\u2026\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026Fray might,\\u201d I finished.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t fix our problem with how we get close enough to them to <em>do</em> anything.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s true, Sy,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cUsing Petey, attacking with our massed forces, spying, our hands are tied.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen we don\\u2019t use hands,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I tugged on my shirt.\\xa0 The Engineer let it go.\\xa0 I pulled it on, and shivered again at how clammy it was against my already wet skin.\\xa0 \\u201cWe use-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen stepped close, all of a sudden, her face an inch from mine.</p>\\n<p>She licked my forehead, brow to hair.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh,\\u201d I said, my train of thought broken.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo ahead, don\\u2019t worry,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou had ink on your face.\\xa0 I wanted to get rid of it before it stained.\\xa0 Keep talking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s what you use a handkerchief for.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was a glimmer of the older, frustrating Helen.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t have one and my spit would work better anyway.\\xa0 Go back to what you were saying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was I even saying?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t use hands,\\u201d the Wry Man said, patiently.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\xa0 Damn it, Helen, and I had a good one-liner planned.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt would have sounded silly if you said it with a blue stripe on your face,\\u201d she said, very sensibly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cFocus.\\xa0 What are you thinking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe use <em>horns</em>,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re right,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t sound nearly as cool after the interruption.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed, then shivered again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHorns?\\u201d Petey asked.</p>\\n<p>My eyes scanned the surroundings.\\xa0 The city, laid out like it is.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t build a city like this without a <em>design</em> in mind.\\xa0 Winding roads, claustrophobia, gates to control movement, towers to observe\\u2026 all done with a point in mind.\\xa0 If they seriously didn\\u2019t give the capstone of this design horns, I\\u2019m going to be ticked.\\xa0 Gotta tie it together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Brechwell Beast,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease tell me it has horns.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt has horns,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I smiled, spreading my arms.\\xa0 \\u201cPerfect.\\xa0 Then let\\u2019s give them a distraction.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a last ditch measure,\\u201d The Wry Man said, unimpressed.\\xa0 \\u201cNot something we use right away.\\xa0 We\\u2019re supposed to observe and report back so the Academy can take action, not take action ourselves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes were wide, I was smiling, and I was shivering from excitement as much as cold, now.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s <em>Genevieve Fray</em>.\\xa0 She\\u2019s two moves ahead of us, every damn time.\\xa0 I\\u2019m done playing chess.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s kick over the damn table.\\xa0 Right now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not sure,\\u201d Petey said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t how I operate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike I said,\\u201d Helen said, reaching out to take Petey\\u2019s hand.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re with <em>us</em> for now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t what I was imagining,\\u201d Petey said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m gathering Helen is for Sy\\u2019s plan,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to see it,\\u201d Helen said, the excitement clear on her face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 Gordon reached out to touch the side of Helen\\u2019s face.\\xa0 \\u201cNo act, no games.\\xa0 Because I know you don\\u2019t <em>want</em> like we understand it.\\xa0 Say it again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The enthusiasm drained away from Helen.\\xa0 Her eyes still glittered, but her expression was cold.\\xa0 The angle of her head, the way she held herself, it all shifted in the moment.\\xa0 More reptile than mammal, wearing raincoat and a dress.</p>\\n<p>She nodded once.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 His hand settled on Hubris\\u2019 head.\\xa0 \\u201cIf Sy wants to do it, and if we can get the cooperation of the Academy, then I\\u2019m for it too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen smiled, resuming her act as if nothing had occurred.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, then,\\u201d Mary agreed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Lillian said, which was a little surprising.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s get that bitch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary reached out to squeeze Lillian\\u2019s hand, smiling at her best friend.</p>\\n<p>As one, the Lambs faced the others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think this will work?\\u201d Catcher asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo idea, but I\\u2019m fairly sure that anything else we do, biding our time, it\\u2019s not going to work,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know Fray, and we can\\u2019t give her the opportunity to make the next move at her leisure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Catcher nodded.\\xa0 He looked at Dog, who didn\\u2019t give any apparent sign, then looked at us.\\xa0 He nodded once.</p>\\n<p>The solo operators were silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll go up,\\u201d the Wry Man said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know the signals.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll flash a message to the other towers.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll pass it on.\\xa0 If I say we know where Fray is, they\\u2019ll act.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled wider.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll catch up after I\\u2019ve given the order.\\xa0 We\\u2019re creating a window of opportunity here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I remembered my doubts from earlier.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan we trust you to do this?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\xa0 Why are you with the Academy?\\xa0 Why are you loyal?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat question could get you killed, if you asked it in certain places, or asked it in the wrong way,\\u201d the Wry Man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you deflecting?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t even know what that means,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Why?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey saved my life,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot the Academy as a whole, but people who are tied to it.\\xa0 I have to repay those people, and I will probably never manage it before I die.\\xa0 If I have to serve the Academy to do it, I will.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My brain was pulling on every hint and detail on tells that I\\u2019d learned over the past several years.\\xa0 Every lie I\\u2019d identified.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI trust you.\\xa0 I told them to expect someone.\\xa0 You could tell them we spotted the enemy ringleader and they\\u2019ll believe you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded once, then started climbing the ladder.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou two don\\u2019t have to come,\\u201d Gordon said, to the other solo operators.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think I do,\\u201d Petey said.</p>\\n<p>The Engineer nodded.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d have rather they\\u2019d stayed, or gone back to the Academy to report in.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t trust them, and they\\u2019d be at our back in this.</p>\\n<p>We were halfway back to where we\\u2019d seen the ghost when the beam started flashing, pointed back at the Academy.\\xa0 The dark, overcast night sky glowed orange on one end and reflected a dim yellow-white on the other, passing on a message.</p>\\n<p>Our enemies would see that light in the same way we\\u2019d seen the fire.</p>\\n<p>In a short time, I hoped, they\\u2019d hear the roar of the Brechwell Beast, and they\\u2019d react with concern and fear.</p>\\n<p>The box would be thoroughly rattled, the inhabitants set to scurrying, dangerous and mad as they were.</p>\\n<p>This was what I lived for.</p>\\n<p><a

making a series of high-pitched squealing noises that made sparks appear behind my eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot to warn you, Helen, I almost hit you on reflex there,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh, Petey\\u2019s trying it.\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 That\\u2019s close.\\xa0 But make each sound shorter, I think, and you\\u2019ll have to do it loud when it counts\\u201d Helen said, \\u201cthat\\u2019s \\u2018many\\u2019, they did that when the building back in Radham was surrounded.\\xa0 Now do this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen squealed again, in a way only young girls and very talented babies could.\\xa0 She maintained the noise for three seconds, then five, then ten.</p>\\n<p>Gordon clapped his hand over Helen\\u2019s mouth just as she reached the ten second mark, which made me think he\\u2019d <em>also</em> been counting the seconds until she stopped.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou could weaponize that,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s response was muffled.\\xa0 Unable to turn her head, she pointed at Petey, then raised one thumb in approval.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThink you got it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Helen tapped twice on Gordon\\u2019s hand.\\xa0 He moved it away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a <em>big</em> threat.\\xa0 They keep making that noise when the Superweapon is close.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t do that willy-nilly, okay?\\xa0 They\\u2019ll figure out you\\u2019re faking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPetey knows what he\\u2019s doing,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>My estimation of Petey wasn\\u2019t very high.\\xa0 Everything I\\u2019d seen about his coordination, his work ethic, his communication,\\xa0the amount he <em>whined</em>, it didn\\u2019t inspire confidence.\\xa0 I was left to wonder if he really did know what he was doing.</p>\\n<p>We reached the ladder, and started our climb.\\xa0 The Brechwell Beast was in Fray\\u2019s general vicinity, if our experiment with the map was right.\\xa0\\xa0 Shots from the tower were a regular thing, now, though none seemed to be directed at us.</p>\\n<p>Further down the ladder, Helen was still coaching Petey, making an assortment of sounds.\\xa0 It felt like each one was specifically designed to drill at a particular set of nerves.\\xa0 Gordon was already getting irritable, but my mood, at least, was improved by the fact that things seemed to be at least partially on track.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s next?\\u201d Mary asked, from above me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe get as close as we possibly can,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cTrack what they\\u2019re doing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>Gordon\\u2019s on the same page as me, at least.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe either move as a group to try and get ahead of them and disrupt their retreat, or we send Petey out alone or with a friend and do what we can independently.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI prefer the latter,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re shaken up, there might be vulnerabilities, or information, or something we can use.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThought you\\u2019d say that,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The rote action of climbing up a ladder was starting to tire me out.\\xa0 Muscles here and there had been strained or pushed to their limits by my earlier fall and a night of full-body exertion.\\xa0 The repetitive movements were slowly and steadily making it worse.</p>\\n<p>My mind was in five different places at once, free associating.\\xa0 There were too many notes to hit, here, and too many little details that tied my hands.\\xa0 The rampaging superweapon wasn\\u2019t one of those details, oddly enough.\\xa0 The possibility that Petey or the Wry Man could sabotage us, maintaining the general safety of the Lambs, and the time constraint were issues that I kept running into.</p>\\n<p><em>Start with the obvious, see if I can\\u2019t see other angles.\\xa0 Frontal attack.\\xa0 Obviously no.\\xa0 Why not?\\xa0 They\\u2019re strong, they\\u2019re prepared for a fight, we\\u2019re weak, risks the well being of Lambs.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Bait, sacrificial play.\\xa0 We have three solo operators, and even only raising the idea might reveal things about them.\\xa0 Too willing, unwilling, lack of cooperation.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Resources, resources, where do we have resources?\\xa0 Lillian\\u2019s stuff, not good enough, Academy burning\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p><em>Environment, then.\\xa0 What can we use?\\xa0 What can Fray use?\\xa0 She\\u2019s going to want to take the towers.\\xa0 She probably already planned to.\\xa0 Surest way to turn things around on us.</em></p>\\n<p>My thoughts continued to turn over in the back of my head, sometimes switching back and forth at a moment\\u2019s notice, while my mind\\u2019s eye was on the current prize.</p>\\n<p>Well, my <em>eyes</em> were on Mary, who was higher than me on the ladder.\\xa0 She was wearing hose, which denied me the ability to poke fun at her and get a reaction.\\xa0 Alas.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThinking aloud,\\u201d I said, very slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d Gordon told me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPetey goes ahead, we flank.\\xa0 The less time they can spend discussing and cooperating, the better.\\xa0 If we can ratchet up pressure, distract, capitalize on their weaknesses or change their priorities, we win.\\xa0 Best case scenario, they implode.\\xa0 Worst case scenario, they lose time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI prefer to think in terms of hard victory conditions,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf they\\u2019re still here when everyone else arrives, we win,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWill that really do it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt might not be so bad if they evacuate as a group, if they split up after, but our true \\u2018win\\u2019 is if they\\u2019re confined in the city when the soldiers and superweapons congregate.\\xa0 After that point, things are out of our hands.\\xa0 Maybe we keep going, maybe not,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut if they can escape with everyone else here and surrounding them, then it\\u2019s really not our fault, is it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The question inspired a thought.\\xa0 With Fray, we had to consider if we were playing straight into her hands.\\xa0 Right now, assuming she wasn\\u2019t preoccupied as the mediator between two factions, she was busy anticipating my and everyone else\\u2019s next steps.\\xa0 Was she <em>counting</em> on all of our forces assembling?\\xa0 Would we surround her, only for one side to turn on fellow soldiers or deploy a weapon?</p>\\n<p>I felt like something was missing.\\xa0 We needed to catch her off guard, but she\\u2019d already planned so much for what was happening right now, she had traps and countermeasures already in place, and there was no amount of thinking I could do to catch up to her.\\xa0 She\\u2019d had a chance to study the area, she\\u2019d had a chance to think on this at leisure.</p>\\n<p>Every time my mind touched on the vague image of the situation I needed to contrive to put Fray on her heels, there was a lot of violence, fire, and there was a vague mental image of the Beast bearing down on her, which was an amusing mental picture, if a dark one.</p>\\n<p>It was like having my thoughts caught in an endless loop.\\xa0 Needed to pressure her, catch her off guard, that was best done by tearing down everything around her, but her gathered forces probably beat the Lambs and our temporary allies in a fight, and I didn\\u2019t trust the various superweapons or soldiers on our side.\\xa0 I needed to find another way to pressure her, then, but my mind kept going back to blood, explosions and tragedy as the way of achieving that.</p>\\n<p>I wondered if I\\u2019d accidentally imprinted my malleable brain with that particular pattern, creating a rut of sorts I kept falling back to.</p>\\n<p><em>Change tacks, abandon that line of thought.\\xa0 We scout.\\xa0 Need to put ourselves in the best possible position to spot any vulnerabilities, and there have to be some.\\xa0 Not necessarily with her.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe split up,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cGives us more chances to capitalize on any mistakes or fractures.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan I go with Petey?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBad idea,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou two have a lot of the same weaknesses.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could have hugged Gordon.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t like trusting any of the Lambs to the company of the solo operators.\\xa0 Instead, I just nodded, \\u201cLet\\u2019s say, Petey goes with\\u2026 the Engineer.\\xa0 Then Lambs in two discrete groups.\\xa0 Not that sure I like that, I have to admit, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you like it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause it\\u2019s\\u2026 because I don\\u2019t trust myself, I don\\u2019t trust Gordon, and I don\\u2019t trust you.\\xa0 Too much at stake, and I feel like we\\u2019re all emotionally compromised.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon is?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 Maybe don\\u2019t pay attention to that part,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>But I brought it up and you brought attention to it so it\\u2019s definitely in mind.\\xa0 </em>I lied, \\u201cHe\\u2019s been working at a different rhythm all night.\\xa0 Trying to prove something?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave I?\\u201d Gordon asked, sounding genuinely curious.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTake my word for it?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He seemed very accepting of the possibility.</p>\\n<p><em>Not so much it matters, but I\\u2019m not about to go into detail about the fact you wanted to go with Fray last time.\\xa0 This is the next best thing</em>.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d reached the top of the ladder.\\xa0 He climbed off, then let Hubris climb down from across his shoulders.\\xa0 I wondered how tired he was, lugging a large dog up and down ladders like he was.\\xa0 Anyone would be exhausted, except he was the most athletic of us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, I already know how I\\u2019m compromised,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She stepped off the ladder and extended a hand, helping keep me steady as I stepped onto the roof.</p>\\n<p>I could see the little mannerisms, the fidget of fingers, the way she stood a little straighter, a little more rigid, the young <em>lady</em> who had been raised with culture and forged into a weapon by Percy.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t like admitting personal flaws.\\xa0 Gordon could do it, but for Mary, it stung.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry, Mary,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I ran my fingers through wet hair and then made a gun with my hands and touched it to the side of my head, \\u201cI\\u2019m in this weird place.\\xa0 Trying to be honest, but I\\u2019m not very good at that.\\xa0 I figure it\\u2019s better to say it badly or say it while stepping on toes than not to say it at all, right now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot that I\\u2019m disagreeing with this specific scenario, but don\\u2019t compromise what you\\u2019re good at,\\u201d Gordon told me.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure what he was saying, or why, but I had the gist of it.\\xa0 Maybe he\\u2019d noticed Mary\\u2019s reaction to how I\\u2019d pointed out the Percy situation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich brings me to the subject of, well, you said I was off-rhythm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDifferent rhythm,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I was a little proud of myself for remembering the exact phrasing I\\u2019d used no more than a minute ago.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou called me on that, I\\u2019m calling you out.\\xa0 I feel like you\\u2019re <em>trying </em>too much.\\xa0 This doesn\\u2019t feel like our Sy.\\xa0 How you\\u2019re acting isn\\u2019t quite natural or fluid.\\xa0 This thing with being honest is part of it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cForced,\\u201d I commented.\\xa0 I extended a hand and seized Lillian\\u2019s wrist, leading her up to the apex of the roof.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNine months of \\u2018gimme\\u2019 jobs leaving you a little rusty?\\xa0 I know you slip easily without practice-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh.\\xa0 Okay,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He shrugged.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t pressing any more.\\xa0 He\\u2019d raised the idea, he seemed to grasp that I had a bit of an idea of what was going on, and was content to leave it at that.</p>\\n<p>In the spirit of honesty, I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m just trying to adapt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He clapped a hand on my shoulder.</p>\\n<p>The little gesture only made me feel an ache for Jamie, in a weird way.</p>\\n<p>I took in a deep breath, and took note of where the Beast was.\\xa0 He was near another area where an gray plume of smoke was rising into the sky, periodically flickering orange from the flames beneath it.\\xa0 Would he press on through and escape into another part of Brechwell?</p>\\n<p>While the other members of the group reached the rooftop, I pulled my shirt into a better position.\\xa0 It was wet enough to cling to me.</p>\\n<p>The Engineer made it over the top of the ladder and handed over the rifles he was carrying.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary each took one.\\xa0 Petey took a third.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s the sound for death, right?\\xa0 If you mix the two, like you did with \\u2018new\\u2019 and \\u2018threat\\u2019, <em>yes</em>.\\xa0 Exactly,\\u201d Helen was saying.\\xa0 \\u201cExactly like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Petey only seemed to glower back in response, mouth slightly parted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs Petey good to go?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlmost,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cTrying to cover the bases.\\xa0 Studied the captured Ghosts in Ibott\\u2019s lab as practice for my new ears.\\xa0 Complex parts of the language might be tricky to do, but being loud can make up for not being very subtle, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo, just to try it out, maybe \\u2018new\\u2019 and \\u2018big\\u2019?\\xa0 Follow with the lighter \\u2018back\\u2019 cue, without the bob.\\xa0 Loud as you can.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s expression changed, as she went wide-eyed, almost horrified.\\xa0 She reached out and grabbed Gordon by the shirt front.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s something here!\\xa0 Surprise attack, and it\\u2019s big, I\\u2019m getting out of here!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Even knowing it was an act, I almost believed her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho\\u2019s Bob?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBob is a <em>verb</em>, silly Gordon.\\xa0 Like a pigeon\\u2019s head?\\u201d Helen asked.\\xa0 \\u201cExcept it\\u2019s a sound?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon shook his head, confused.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was the one with the answer.\\xa0 \\u201cI think I might know what she means.\\xa0 When a pigeon takes flight, if it\\u2019s just flying off for whatever reason, it will bob its head first.\\xa0 If it\\u2019s flying off because of danger, it won\\u2019t bother, and every pigeon that sees is going to take that as a cue to fly off too-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-Without a bob,\\u201d I cut in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Without a bob, which cues others.\\xa0 That way, if one pigeon spots a predator, they all have the best chance.\\xa0 Except the Ghosts do it when vocalizing, I presume,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>Helen nodded, emphatic,\\xa0 \\u201cEvery time they go someplace new, they communicate it.\\xa0 They \\u2018bob\\u2019 when it isn\\u2019t important, but they\\u2019re still letting others know where they are.\\xa0 When they don\\u2019t bob, then it\\u2019s saying-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat others should follow their lead,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cGot it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I found myself wishing that worked with people.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPetey knows some of this, probably, but doesn\\u2019t know all of the communication.\\xa0 That makes it hard to be a sneaky sort of Ghost,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf he keeps misusing bobs or forgetting to use them, he stands out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs he going to do the scream, the command you just did?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe did,\\u201d Helen said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re running.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd,\\u201d Mary observed, \\u201cIt looks like we also signaled our friends.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was Dog and Catcher, with the Wry Man trailing behind.\\xa0 Their initial approach seemed hurried, but as they drew nearer and had a better view of the situation, they slowed to a somewhat more relaxed pace.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPetey, Engineer,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cFigure out what you need to do to stay close enough to each other while being able to cover each other\\u2019s backs.\\xa0 You can hold your own if it comes to it, Engineer?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Engineer nodded once.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBetter not waste any time.\\xa0 Helen\\u2019s prepped you as good as you\\u2019ll get.\\xa0 Go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat way,\\u201d I said, pointing.</p>\\n<p>They left.</p>\\n<p>We met Dog, Catcher, and the Wry Man halfway.\\xa0 Well, that wasn\\u2019t exactly true.\\xa0 They covered more ground, by virtue of having more raw strength and longer legs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFound her,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cLooped back to look for you, found him instead.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny problems?\\u201d the Wry Man asked.</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.\\xa0 \\u201cGot Petey a convenient new body and some quick lessons in speaking Ghost more effectively.\\xa0 She\\u2019s going to throw a wrench into their ability to scout.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A violent impact shook Brechwell, worse than any we\\u2019d felt yet.\\xa0 I traced the roads with my eyes until I saw the plume of dust and debris further away.\\xa0 It seemed the Beast had run down one city street, but from the look of it, the road was one only accessible through Fray\\u2019s hole in the wall, and the creature had charged straight into a T-shaped intersection.\\xa0 Without a smooth curve in the road to guide it, it had struck a row of buildings at full force.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Gordon, Helen, and Mary, and I squeezed Lillian\\u2019s wrist.\\xa0 I suspected we were all thinking along the same lines.</p>\\n<p>The Beast had escaped the track it was meant to run, free of its cage, so to speak.\\xa0 The city was built to guide and confine it, and it had found a way out.</p>\\n<p>If Fray was going to make a move, assuming she knew, saw, or could intuit what had just happened, then this was her opportunity to evacuate.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShow us where she is, now,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The rain was coming down harder than before, and that had the effect of making it harder to see, our footsteps more prone to slip just a fraction.</p>\\n<p>Gordon seemed content to fill Catcher in, explaining the plan, that we\\u2019d be splitting up, what we were looking to achieve.</p>\\n<p>Having a strict goal in mind for victory was very Gordon, and in this situation, it was very useful, too.</p>\\n<p><em>What does Fray want?\\xa0 What is her goal for victory?</em></p>\\n<p>I had spent far too much time thinking about Fray over the last months and years.\\xa0 I had a sense of what she wanted on the surface level, to shake things up, to change the order of things.\\xa0 I had a sense of what she wanted on a deeper level, to convince others that her worldview was the right one, to prove herself <em>right</em>.</p>\\n<p>Starting the war, releasing the experiment to sterilize and chemically leash whole swathes of the Western Crown States, it had been a way of bringing everyone around to her point of view, creating that same righteous anger at how things worked, making every man, woman, and youth feel the need to buck against the Academy\\u2019s <em>control</em>, retaliate against the Crown\\u2019s callousness.\\xa0 She\\u2019d used her enemy\\u2019s tools against them, forcing things into play too early.</p>\\n<p>But there was a big difference between proving oneself right and proving the other guy wrong.</p>\\n<p>Bringing two factions together like she was served as another kind of validation.\\xa0 Being so very right that others came around to her point of view.\\xa0 I could see why she was here and why she was doing what she was doing.\\xa0 I could imagine that her drive was focused by the drugs she\\u2019d taken, honing ambition and perfectionism that had already been there, as evidenced by her gray coat and the self-medicating with Wyvern.\\xa0 It let her spend ten or more hours a day focused wholly on the tasks at hand.</p>\\n<p>I wished I knew her better.\\xa0 I wanted to get inside her head, hit her where it hurt, peeling away the veneer, and then figure out if there was something fragile, mad, or awe-inspiring lurking beneath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re close,\\u201d Catcher spoke in his gravelly voice, the sound carrying back to the rest of us.\\xa0 \\u201cSee it?\\xa0 She was there!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>His weapon pointed the way, the spiked head aimed at a squat, broad building.\\xa0 It was part of the concentric rings that encircled another, taller building, not invisible, but easily overlooked.\\xa0 To look at it, I imagined a bank or a school.</p>\\n<p>The cluster of people around the building painted the rest of the picture.\\xa0 Standing guards, nervous, all keeping within a few paces of exits and escape routes.\\xa0 The Beast was rampaging through nearby streets, and many of the people on the ground were flinching at every impact, as if expecting the Beast to emerge or crash through at any moment.</p>\\n<p>I imagined it was an immense amount of psychological pressure, being down there.</p>\\n<p>The rifle shots I could hear throughout the city each marked one person who\\u2019d broken and made a break for a ladder.\\xa0 I could hear some close by.</p>\\n<p>A spotlight swept over us.\\xa0 I saw heads raise, heard voices on the ground, and tugged on Lillian\\u2019s arm, pulling her way and over to the other side of the roof.\\xa0 I ducked low, and she mimicked me, just in time for some gunshots to sound.</p>\\n<p>We were under fire, but their vantage point was awful, especially as we kept away from that side of the rooftop.\\xa0 We crossed over a gate and reached a forking path.</p>\\n<p>Around the time the spotlight swept over us, momentarily blinding me, more gunshots sounded from the closest tower.\\xa0 I wondered for a moment if they were firing on <em>us, </em>which was not impossible or even unlikely.<em>\\xa0 </em>Then I saw him.</p>\\n<p>The man with the modified birthing saw.\\xa0 I could smell fuel and see the flicker of machinery he wore, all of it keeping the weapon going.\\xa0 Saw-teeth rotated around the edge of the thing at a blur, periodically sparking.\\xa0 He carried a shield as tall as he was, holding it up in the direction of the nearest tower.\\xa0 Bullets struck the shield and bounced off.</p>\\n<p>Mechanical saw in one hand, shield in the other, he advanced on Catcher, Dog, and the Wry Man, smiling wickedly.</p>\\n<p>The Wry Man backed away a few steps, flinching as a shot caught the edge of the roof five feet to his right.\\xa0 He drew a vial from his belt and tossed it back in one gulp.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLambs!\\u201d\\xa0 Catcher called out.\\xa0 \\u201cCircle around!\\xa0 We split up as planned!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We took the other path in the fork.\\xa0 It seemed fairly clear that Dog, Catcher, and the Wry Man were taking the most attention.\\xa0 Gordon raised his rifle and fired, but one more gunshot was lost in the noise, not even drawing any particular attention.</p>\\n<p>The Beast slammed directly against another wall, only a few streets over, and I heard the sound of glass shattering on windows beneath us, glass and frames warping with the force of the impact.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay low,\\u201d Mary spoke, only loud enough that people on the ground weren\\u2019t likely to hear.\\xa0 She gestured at the same time, indicating the Beast, a relatively short distance away.</p>\\n<p>Fumes.\\xa0 Gas.</p>\\n<p>Possible explosions.</p>\\n<p>Was it frustrated?</p>\\n<p>Fray\\u2019s actions regarding the Beast didn\\u2019t quite feel like it fit into her usual pattern.\\xa0 Everything else she\\u2019d done had been about changing minds, often in a very aggressive manner.\\xa0 Who did she convince, doing this?</p>\\n<p>It hadn\\u2019t been timed the way she\\u2019d wanted, or it wasn\\u2019t being used the way she had originally planned.</p>\\n<p>Was there a weakness?\\xa0 Could I shake or break her using that desire to validate and prove her way was the right way?</p>\\n<p>I felt a bit of a chill as I considered the flip side of that same question.</p>\\n<p>There <em>was</em> a way to get to her.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Mary both aimed and fired.\\xa0 Those shots <em>did</em> get attention.\\xa0 We ducked low and used the peak of the roof for cover as we made our way around.\\xa0 We were close, but the number of guards had increased.</p>\\n<p>And, if I admitted it, I was feeling hurt and tired.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t up to running around.\\xa0 We were close enough to see, and that had to be good enough, at least until we decided on another move.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The group drew to a halt.\\xa0 Gordon used the time to reload his weapon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLast bullet,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWant one of mine?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>He took a bullet from her and pocketed it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou okay, Sy?\\xa0 You look cold,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI am,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 My teeth chattered a little from adrenaline and cold combined.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look hurt too,\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSort of.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you want my coat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.\\xa0 \\u201cNo thanks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo sign of Fray,\\u201d Helen commented.</p>\\n<p>I stared at the building.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid she get away already?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWe could spread out further, if you guys want.\\xa0 Sy stays, maybe with Lillian, so he can keep an eye on this place.\\xa0 Mary and Helen or me and Helen go explore, see if there\\u2019s any trace of them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The ground rumbled as the Beast paced through darkness, five or six streets over.\\xa0 The fumes were accumulating faster than they dissipated, and the Beast was slowing down.</p>\\n<p>The last time it had stopped moving, it had ignited its gas.</p>\\n<p>There was a <em>lot</em> of gas, by the looks of it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s here, I\\u2019m positive,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe stay low.\\xa0 Spread out over the rooftop here, so we have more vantage points to see.\\xa0 Gordon far left, Mary far right.\\xa0 Make sure that you aren\\u2019t thrown off if the Beast makes another explosion.\\xa0 Dig in, keep eyes forward.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re <em>positive?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t one hundred percent sure, but I felt sure enough.\\xa0 If Fray was a mirror of me, she probably felt the same sort of insecurities.\\xa0 I\\u2019d worried about how fractured the Lambs were, and she was dealing with a fractured group.\\xa0 Would she call for a retreat, if she wasn\\u2019t certain that she\\u2019d be able to reunite the two factions in the aftermath of the retreat?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a dubious look.</p>\\n<p>But he retraced his steps, heading left.\\xa0 Mary went right, each of them with a rifle that each had, by my count, two bullets.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShoot only lieutenants or Fray,\\u201d I said, \\u201cOr in self defense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>They each signaled the affirmative.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen, that way, between me and Gordon.\\xa0 Lillian, that way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart was pounding.</p>\\n<p>Dog and Catcher were drawing attention, the rest were taking cover, looking in all the wrong directions.</p>\\n<p>We were free to act, but action was lunacy.</p>\\n<p>We needed one master stroke, something Fray wouldn\\u2019t anticipate.</p>\\n<p>Did I have a grasp of who she was?\\xa0 Who the major players were?\\xa0 The current volatility of their organization?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d started walking away.\\xa0 She stopped, turning to listen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m okay, okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She frowned at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay?\\xa0 I want you to know that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re being cryptic.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSort of.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were being too honest before.\\xa0 Was that a lead-in to you being particularly dishonest?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot intentionally, but now that I\\u2019m here, with a plan in mind\\u2026 yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEasier to show and tell,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I slid down the roof until I reached the gutter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh!\\xa0 If you shout, you\\u2019ll get us both shot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Sylvester</em>,\\u201d she hissed, a strained whisper.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m okay,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>As I\\u2019d done after being thrown down the roof, I lowered myself down until I hung on wet wood by my fingertips.</p>\\n<p>I shimmied over to one side, until there was a broken window in front of me.</p>\\n<p>Too much glass on the sill.</p>\\n<p>I shimmied over some more.</p>\\n<p>There.</p>\\n<p>I swung forward, and felt the heart-stopping moment as I let go, flying toward the window.\\xa0 I grabbed the too-thin crossbar in the center, a surer point to grip.\\xa0 Then, the moment I had contact, slapped my hands out to catch the sides of the window instead.</p>\\n<p>I passed into a darker office.</p>\\n<p>The Beast\\u2019s movements made picture frames and furniture rattle and shift.</p>\\n<p>It was easier to get out of the office than it would have been to get in.</p>\\n<p>Down the stairs, to the front door.\\xa0 I would be forced to leave it unlocked, but there was no way to be polite.</p>\\n<p>A mailbox sat just inside the door.\\xa0 I picked my way through envelopes until I found a nondescript one, then I waited, periodically looking outside, assessing who and what was nearby.</p>\\n<p>The ghosts weren\\u2019t there.\\xa0 Petey might have sufficiently distracted or herded them.</p>\\n<p>The detonation caught me off guard.\\xa0 Even with streets and solid stone buildings between me and the detonation site, it left me briefly stunned.</p>\\n<p>I pushed the door open.</p>\\n<p>Outside, onto a street shrouded in smoke and darkness, where I could barely see ten\\xa0 feet in front of me, envelope in hand.</p>\\n<p><em>Walk, don\\u2019t run.</em></p>\\n<p>I made it three quarters of the way to the building before someone spotted me, walking with my hands out to the side, an envelope held out between index and middle finger.</p>\\n<p>Their gun pointed at my chest.</p>\\n<p>I continued walking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I stopped.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs were going to be so pissed at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m accepting Fray\\u2019s invitation to sit in on the meeting,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He whistled sharply.</p>\\n<p>More people approached.\\xa0 Two kept guns trained on me.\\xa0 The first guy got close enough to take the letter.\\xa0 I let it fall from my fingertips.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat has nothing to do with this.\\xa0 I just needed a white flag so you wouldn\\u2019t shoot me before I got close,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Then I lied, \\u201cI <em>am</em> telling the truth.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLamb,\\u201d one of the men said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re told to treat all children as suspicious, and not to listen,\\u201d one of the men said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re one of Cynthia\\u2019s, I\\u2019m guessing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He raised his jaw a fraction.\\xa0 I was right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne of you go inside.\\xa0 Talk to Genevieve Fray.\\xa0 She\\u2019ll tell you what\\u2019s up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Appealing to a higher authority.</em></p>\\n<p>Except Genevieve Fray <em>hadn\\u2019t</em> invited me.</p>\\n<p>Well, not in anything but the loosest sense.\\xa0 She\\u2019d extended an invitation a year and a few months ago, before the war had started.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t remember much, but I remembered <em>that</em>.</p>\\n<p>I watched the men exchange glances.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTurn around,\\u201d one of them said.</p>\\n<p>I did.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKneel.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hm.\\xa0 This wasn\\u2019t a good sign.\\xa0 I knelt.</p>\\n<p>I felt a gun press against the back of my head.</p>\\n<p>Then a coat was draped over my head.\\xa0 I moved my hands to adjust it, and got a fierce poke with the bayonet blade, alongside a sharp, \\u201cNo!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was having my head covered.\\xa0 I supposed they didn\\u2019t want to show the way to Fray.</p>\\n<p>Whatever.</p>\\n<p>I could hear the Beast tearing at building, I could hear the bells, I could imagine Lillian hurrying to communicate to the other Lambs about what I was doing, if they couldn\\u2019t see me down here.</p>\\n<p>Minutes passed.</p>\\n<p>Fray wanted to change minds, she wanted to prove her worth, she collected the vulnerable, and her past interactions with the Lambs and with <em>me</em> had played off of that.</p>\\n<p>Here, I was expecting she would keep to that pattern.</p>\\n<p>I was expecting that, whatever else happened, her authority and power here would override the lesser players, some of whom had reason to loathe the Lambs.\\xa0 To loathe me.</p>\\n<p>I was using the word \\u2018expecting\\u2019 because <em>hope</em> sounded awfully flimsy, and thinking too much along the lines of <em>hope</em> and <em>maybe</em> would set my teeth to chattering far more than they were right now.</p>\\n<p>Voices started up a murmured, muffled conversation behind me.</p>\\n<p>I was hauled to my feet, the jacket left in place.\\xa0 I was walked, a grown man on either side of me.</p>\\n<p>It was only after doors were shut that the jacket was pulled away.\\xa0 I moved my arms as much as I was able and tried to fix my hair.\\xa0 Nothing I could do about my shirt.\\xa0 If I had to look wet and bedraggled, I could look a <em>crazy</em> wet and bedraggled.\\xa0 I opened my eyes wider and smiled.</p>\\n<p>Another set of doors was opened.</p>\\n<p>A hundred sets of eyes fell on me.</p>\\n<p>At a table at the end of the room, I could see the major players.\\xa0 Fray, with Warren, Avis, and her stitched standing behind her.\\xa0 I saw Percy, and Mauer at one end of the table, and Cynthia at the other, with a new and too-artificial skin covered partially by hair, a high collar, long sleeves and gloves, each of them with a half dozen I didn\\u2019t know or recognize.</p>\\n<p>The other eighty-some people I didn\\u2019t know were civilians, standing and sitting in chairs.\\xa0 An audience for the forum.\\xa0 I felt more accurate about my assessment of Fray, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry I\\u2019m late,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Genevieve smiled at me, and it was a smile of a shared secret.\\xa0 There had been no invitation.\\xa0 She and I were probably the only people in the room of any importance who wanted me to walk out of the room alive at this point.\\xa0 Not that I was entirely sure about her feelings on that matter.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/tooth-and-nail-7-7/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Periodic gunshots cut through the sound of the bells and the roars and crashes of the Beast\\u2019s rampage.\\xa0 Striving to find safe ground, some of the members of Fray\\u2019s group had started to climb towers.\\xa0 The rifle shots that didn\\u2019t hit were a form of discouragement and warning.\\xa0 The ones that <em>did</em> hit were even more effective at achieving those same two goals.</p>\\n<p>On the rooftop, we had the benefit of being able to see over the other rooftops and locate the Brechwell Beast.\\xa0 The people on the ground didn\\u2019t- for them, there wasn\\u2019t a good way of distinguishing how far away the Beast was.\\xa0 It was as large as a wealthy man\\u2019s house and I very much suspected it was designed to create noise and make things rattle to batter at the enemy\\u2019s psyche.</p>\\n<p>Tough enough to hold its own in a knock-down, drag-out fight with cannons and artillery, it wasn\\u2019t even playing that fair.\\xa0 When it moved and when it made contact, it was with speed and devastating force.</p>\\n<p>In the distance, the Beast was working on plowing its way through a gap that explosions had created.\\xa0 I heard rifle shots, and saw the Beast react.\\xa0 It backed out of the gap, and began charging back into the designated area, searching for the attackers.</p>\\n<p>A clever trick, one that kept the Beast out of the city as a whole.\\xa0 But it wouldn\\u2019t work forever.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat has to be it!\\u201d Gordon called out.</p>\\n<p>It was a cluster of buildings that stood taller than the rest.\\xa0 The style was slightly different, the design ostentatious, with access controlled by arches, opened further by explosions.\\xa0 Looking at the road, as we got closer, there were more wagons and carriages set to either side of the road, or parked in little archways beside residences.</p>\\n<p>A number of bystanders, too, people bolting along the roads leading to the building.</p>\\n<p>It was possible there were people caught out after dark, but I doubted it.\\xa0 Any \\u2018bystander\\u2019 here had to be assumed to be in Fray\\u2019s employ.\\xa0 The guns many carried and the company they kept were damning.</p>\\n<p>The Beast was drawing closer.</p>\\n<p>A door opened.\\xa0 A man shouted, waving them inside.\\xa0 Another group that would dodge the monster.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh no,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, no, no.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was looking at the door.</p>\\n<p>I looked closer, and I could make out a shape at the man\\u2019s side.\\xa0 In my haste to assess the situation, I\\u2019d taken a mental shortcut, figuring the lump at the man\\u2019s side to be an overlarge leg.\\xa0 A detail held at the back of my mind until I could put all my thoughts in the right order.</p>\\n<p>We needed to get down to the street level, cross, and then deal with the group, and an otherwise unassuming man with that misshapen a leg was probably going to be less of a threat.\\xa0 Less mobile, a single leg wasn\\u2019t about to be something dangerous.</p>\\n<p>But as I tapped into that impression of the man, recognized the lump, and processed what it was.\\xa0 I knew before I even double-checked what I was seeing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMan with a little girl just let a group of rebellion thugs and some Ghosts into his house, to save them from the Brechwell Beast!\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSympathizer?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p><em>Oh, that would be so easy if it were true.</em></p>\\n<p>Lillian squeezed my wrist.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s assume no!\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>The Beast was drawing nearer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Beast passes, we go down behind it!\\u201d I called out.\\xa0 \\u201cCross street, get inside, stop them!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought we were going after Fray!\\u201d Gordon shouted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNever the plan!\\xa0 Hit edge groups!\\xa0 I explain after!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The noise of the Beast\\u2019s one-creature stampede was starting to drown out my words.</p>\\n<p>The Beast appeared, fumes trailing from the corner of its mouth, eyes hidden by the armored mask it had been fitted with.\\xa0 It raked against the side of the buildings we were atop, and the rooftops vibrated.\\xa0 The Engineer punched an armored fist through the shingles to get a grip on the infrastructure beneath, extending an arm to keep me and Lillian from falling, the hand clasping Petey\\u2019s hand.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary seemed to have a handle on their own business, and on Hubris.</p>\\n<p>Helen, well, Helen had a way of being the exception to the rule.\\xa0 I had trouble thinking of a scenario where she would be physically thrown from a rooftop.</p>\\n<p>The Beast\\u2019s momentum carried it into the buildings on the other side of the street, as it rounded a \\u2018u\\u2019 bend directly in front of us.\\xa0 It passed us on the other side, moving in the other direction.</p>\\n<p>By the look of things, it would reach Fray\\u2019s area before terribly long.\\xa0 It remained to be seen if the explosions and damaged buildings would change its route.</p>\\n<p>Probably would.</p>\\n<p>But our enemies were in disarray, and the seemingly impenetrable perimeter had been breached, with everyone running for the hills.\\xa0 The key was to capitalize on this.</p>\\n<p>As soon as we could walk, we made our way to the tower at the end of the row.\\xa0 Helen, Gordon and Mary gripped the sides of the ladder, sliding rather than climbing down, Gordon doing it with one hand, the other holding Hubris to his back.\\xa0 I did the same, even as my hands and one ankle ached.</p>\\n<p>Pain didn\\u2019t often get in my way, I knew how to manage it from long experience and a deeper perspective than most, but it <em>did</em> exist.\\xa0 I knew I was hurt, I\\u2019d probably lightly twisted something, and too much more activity would see me doing more harm to myself.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t have that.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was apparently too scared to slide, but she made some effort and managed a halting progression.\\xa0 Petey and the Engineer were taking the rungs one at a time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on, almost there,\\u201d I said, anxious.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m-\\u201d she slid a distance, the sides of the ladder already wet from the passage of everyone before her, \\u201c-working on it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cClassic white, today, huh?\\u201d\\xa0 I said, staring up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re the worst, Sy,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI knew, moment you got on the ladder before me, that you were going to say something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you didn\\u2019t stop me,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve heard rumors you like the attention.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cScurrilous lies,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She hopped off the ladder, and her face was bright pink.\\xa0 She started to kick my shin, and then stopped, seeing how bloody and ragged it was.\\xa0 She settled for hitting me in the shoulder instead.</p>\\n<p>I glanced up, decided the solo operators were too slow to be useful, and grabbed Lillian\\u2019s hand, tugging her behind me.</p>\\n<p>By the time Lillian and I caught up with the other Lambs, Mary was limp, and Helen was banging on the door.\\xa0 I rushed to Mary\\u2019s side.</p>\\n<p>Gordon signaled.\\xa0 <em>Trick</em>.</p>\\n<p>I tapped Mary\\u2019s shoulder, then signaled, <em>me</em>.</p>\\n<p>She rose from her sitting position, and I let myself fall into Gordon\\u2019s arms like a swooning maiden, just in time for the door to open.</p>\\n<p>Helen was already mid-act.\\xa0 Her voice was a sob as much as it was words.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease, help, please!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man stood in the doorway, looking between us in confusion.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease!\\u201d Helen sobbed.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s hurt!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t move him,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave to,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t that bad of an actor either.\\xa0 \\u201cIt might come back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could see the indecision on the man\\u2019s face.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Mary dragged me.\\xa0 I was already scraped and bleeding from my earlier fall, and I made a better victim.\\xa0 Mary <em>did</em> have the benefit of being the same gender as the man\\u2019s daughter, but it was too hard a sell.</p>\\n<p>I glanced back to see that the Engineer was at the bottom of the ladder, Petey only halfway down.\\xa0 The man hadn\\u2019t noticed, even with the lights illuminating the street.</p>\\n<p>The moment Lillian was inside and the door closed, Mary drew a knife, pressing the tip to the man\\u2019s gut, without actually penetrating cloth and skin.</p>\\n<p>I could see the shock and fear on his face, and I knew he wasn\\u2019t one of them.\\xa0 A bystander who\\u2019d thought he was doing the right thing.</p>\\n<p>Eyes wide, he asked, \\u201cWhat are you-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary pressed a finger to her lips.</p>\\n<p>I rose to my feet, taking the knife from Mary, taking up her position of holding the man at knifepoint.\\xa0 I signaled to the others.\\xa0 <em>Ghost.\\xa0 Alive.</em></p>\\n<p>I got nods in response.\\xa0 Mary, Gordon, Hubris, and Helen fanned out through the house, hand signals flying.</p>\\n<p>Mary passed through a door to the left, then exited a moment later, without a sound, following a few paces behind Helen.\\xa0 Helen paused long enough to get a response from Mary, then the two girls headed down the hallway.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Hubris went through a door to the right.\\xa0 I heard gunshots, and a short bark followed by growling.</p>\\n<p>A man with a dog latched onto his elbow staggered into the hallway.\\xa0 He looked in the opposite direction, further down the hall, then looked at us, alarm and confusion on his face.</p>\\n<p>An ordinary soldier, if I had to guess, or someone who was taking the drugs, remarkably young.</p>\\n<p>Then again, war often involved the young.\\xa0 It would be too tidy and polite if the only price for war was the lives of old men.</p>\\n<p>Gordon re-entered the hallway, holding a rifle with a bayonet blade on it.\\xa0 Not one of the exorcists, sadly.</p>\\n<p>Hubris let go of the arm, then went for a knee, wrenching and twisting.\\xa0 Stronger than even the average fighting dog, he was able to topple the larger man.</p>\\n<p>Almost casually, Gordon thrust the blade of the bayonet at the area where shoulder joined neck.\\xa0 A twist and a sharp motion carved out the front of the man\\u2019s throat.\\xa0 Blood sprayed.</p>\\n<p>A bloodstained Gordon took in the surroundings, then tossed his rifle at Lillian, an underhand lob that left the stained blade pointed skyward through the entire trip.</p>\\n<p>His hands free, he signaled, <em>two</em>, then disappeared back into the room he\\u2019d just left.\\xa0 He emerged with another rifle.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t look back our way as he headed after Mary and Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d the man I was holding at knifepoint asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease tell me there\\u2019s a rule about opening your door when the bells are ringing?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere is, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou broke the rule,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNow you\\u2019ve got blood on your nice rug here, and a dead body in your living room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I heard gunshots upstairs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy daughter-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMight die,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d Lillian admonished me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe <em>might</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re here, at least, we might be able to stop them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou could phrase it nicer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Nice?\\xa0 </em>You think anything about this here is <em>nice</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think it\\u2019s nice that you wanted to come here to help, at least,\\u201d she conceded.</p>\\n<p>My finger reached over and touched Melancholy\\u2019s ring.\\xa0 I rotated it around my thumb.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Where were Petey and the Engineer?</p>\\n<p>Too much could go wrong tonight, but the worst eventuality was that we\\u2019d hit our stride and then discover at the worst possible moment that we would end up having a problem with our guest members.\\xa0 The possibility kept recurring in my mind.</p>\\n<p>I gestured at Lillian, <em>watch</em>, and indicated the door.</p>\\n<p>She cracked it open, then opened it wider, waving.</p>\\n<p>The Engineer and Petey approached.\\xa0 The man of meat and metal ducked his head to fit into the space.\\xa0 I could hear too many wet sucking noises as he passed within a foot of me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCouldn\\u2019t find you,\\u201d the Engineer said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight, sorry,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>I\\u2019m so used to having everyone paying effective attention to everyone else.</em></p>\\n<p>I took my knife, and handed it to Petey, \\u201cWatch him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Petey nodded once.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUpstairs,\\u201d I told the Engineer, pointing.</p>\\n<p>He took off running.</p>\\n<p>When I took off, Lillian followed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was going to have us come here anyway,\\u201d I said, quiet, \\u201cBefore I learned about the man having the kid, being a probable innocent.\\xa0 Can\\u2019t take moral credit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought so,\\u201d Lillian muttered.\\xa0 \\u201cBut her father at least got to see us as good guys after hearing me say it, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyebrows went up.</p>\\n<p>I mentally awarded Lillian a gold star for that.</p>\\n<p>We reached the top of the stairs.\\xa0 There was something of a standoff.\\xa0 A man stood at the far end of the hallway, back to a door, a gun to the head of a little girl in lace-covered shorts and nightshirt.\\xa0 She was holding back sobs, eyes red.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay put!\\u201d the man was shouting at the Engineer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s our timeline, Sy?\\u201d Gordon asked, quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to move fast.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThought so,\\u201d he spoke under his breath.\\xa0 He turned his head more, acknowledging Lillian\\u2019s presence.</p>\\n<p>I knew what he was thinking.\\xa0 If we pushed ahead, aiming for the element of surprise, then there was something of a chance that Lillian could patch up the damage or at least keep the girl alive.</p>\\n<p>I touched the ring at my thumb again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut don\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat the hell are you brats muttering about!?\\u201d the man shouted at us.\\xa0 His shout made the young hostage wince.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m telling my buddies not to kill you just yet, limpdick!\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>I saw a measure of incredulity and anger cross his face.\\xa0 Emotions were too high for him to bury all of his emotions.</p>\\n<p>Gordon put one hand behind his back.\\xa0 He gestured.\\xa0 <em>Forward.</em></p>\\n<p>Then he indicated off to one side.\\xa0 Not me and Lillian, but the Engineer.</p>\\n<p>I was in a position to push the Engineer\\u2019s rear end.\\xa0 It squelched more like a sodden sponge than anything else.\\xa0 My skin crawled.</p>\\n<p>He glanced down at me with one good eye, and I made a little gesture with my finger, point-point.</p>\\n<p>He took one half-step forward.\\xa0 Gordon stumbled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t move!\\u201d the man with the gun asked.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t you damn well move!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have to ask,\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhen did you stop fighting <em>for</em> the people of this country and start seeing them as leverage?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo head games!\\xa0 No questions!\\xa0 If you try to get clever, I\\u2019m shooting!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you want?\\u201d Helen asked.\\xa0 Her voice was calm, a counterpoint to the man\\u2019s.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat steps do we need to take to take to get you to let her go?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMoving toward me isn\\u2019t one of them.\\xa0 Neither is touching those weapons.\\xa0 Drop \\u2019em.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>One by one, everyone put their weapons down, borrowed rifles clattering on hardwood and against stairs.</p>\\n<p>Something was off, I noticed, as I saw the group bending down and dropping their weapons.</p>\\n<p>Oh.\\xa0 Hubris was gone.\\xa0 The stumble was a distraction.\\xa0 Hubris had used the opportunity to bolt.</p>\\n<p>Gordon had this situation in hand.\\xa0 He had a better view of the situation.\\xa0 He had figured something out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Wait</em>, stop talking,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 There was a pause, quiet but for the sound of bells, the distant rumbles of the Beast, and the sniffles of a girl three or four years younger than I was.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Okay.\\xa0 Go.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p>Without a noise, Hubris leaped.\\xa0 Teeth seized the man\\u2019s weapon hand, carrying it to one side, well clear of the young girl\\u2019s head.\\xa0 A moment later, he was fighting, wrestling, wrenching, clamping deep into the man\\u2019s hand, making him double over in pain and from Hubris\\u2019 sheer weight.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEngineer?\\u201d Gordon asked, stepping back out of the way, extending a hand in invitation.</p>\\n<p>The Engineer marched down the hall.\\xa0 The man who\\u2019d taken the little girl hostage saw him coming, but his movements were hampered by the tugs and biting.</p>\\n<p>The Engineer\\u2019s fist struck his head, compressed it against the doorframe\\xa0 and cracked it like a melon.\\xa0 Hubris bounded back to Gordon.\\xa0 The girl screamed.</p>\\n<p>Helen extended her arms for a hug, and the girl threw herself at Helen like a drowning person might reach for a rope.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo more,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey were up here,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI heard them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>In close confines</em>.\\xa0 <em>Ghosts.</em></p>\\n<p>The Engineer stepped away from the man\\u2019s corpse, stepping into another room.\\xa0 I saw only a glimpse as he bodily threw a piece of furniture across the room.</p>\\n<p><em>Rooting them out of hiding places.</em></p>\\n<p>My mind was in top gear as I took in the layout, trying to figure out the paths available to them.\\xa0 Four rooms, two on either side of the hallway, with a small closet or bathroom at the end.</p>\\n<p>Engineer in the further-left room.\\xa0 Helen halfway down the hall.\\xa0 They weren\\u2019t about to try to squeeze past Lillian, me, and Mary.</p>\\n<p>Hubris had ducked into the left room, crossed to the room the Engineer was in now, the further room, and re-entered the hallway.\\xa0 There was no doorway allowing passage between the two rooms to the right in that same way.</p>\\n<p>Where were they hiding, and how would they try to escape?</p>\\n<p>I reached out and took the rifle from Lillian.\\xa0 \\u201cGordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He turned to look at me.</p>\\n<p>I gestured.\\xa0 Gordon obeyed, stepping into the same room the Engineer was in, Hubris following.</p>\\n<p>I tightened my grip.\\xa0 Mary had a throwing knife.</p>\\n<p>Furniture crashed against the wall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot one!\\u201d Gordon called out.</p>\\n<p>In that same moment, a Ghost appeared from the room just to our left.\\xa0 Fast, silent, I was <em>expecting</em> her and I was still caught off guard.</p>\\n<p>Rather than try to aim and shoot, I stepped forward, swiping.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t a serious cut, no force behind it, not fast enough a swing.\\xa0 But the Ghost stepped aside to avoid it.</p>\\n<p>She had to get by Helen to reach the available window to the right.\\xa0 That limited her path.</p>\\n<p>I aimed and pulled the trigger.\\xa0 The little girl in Helen\\u2019s arms yelped at the sound.\\xa0 The shot was a miss, the Ghost didn\\u2019t even bother to dodge.</p>\\n<p>Mary raised a hand, firing a pistol, and the Ghost <em>did</em> dodge that shot.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t get any further.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d delayed too much, and Helen had fingers latched into the side of the Ghost\\u2019s tunic.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep her alive,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cM\\u2019kay,\\u201d Helen replied.</p>\\n<p>Fabric tore, the Ghost fought to get back and pull free, striking at Helen\\u2019s face, but it was too little too late.\\xa0 Helen didn\\u2019t react to being struck, reached out and wrapped one hand and wrist around the Ghost\\u2019s thigh.</p>\\n<p>Helen collapsed against the Ghost as if she\\u2019d been <em>pulled</em> into position.\\xa0 The Ghost\\u2019s silent struggles got it nowhere.\\xa0 Helen crawled up to a better perch, hugging the Ghost\\u2019s back, pinning its arms against its sides.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou.\\xa0 Little girl,\\u201d I said, to the young girl.</p>\\n<p>She was wide eyed, barely registering.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo downstairs to your daddy now,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t listen.</p>\\n<p><em>Why were ordinary people so frustrating?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t you want to see your dad?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome here,\\u201d Lillian said, voice gentle.\\xa0 \\u201cCome on, take my hand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The girl reached out, hesitant.\\xa0 Lillian took her hand firmly, and Mary and I stepped to opposite ends of the hallway as Lillian led her down the stairs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey wait in the living room,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cSend Petey up, maybe.\\xa0 But come back, we might need you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>The remainder of our group approached Helen.\\xa0 I had a view through the one doorway to the room the Engineer had overturned.\\xa0 A dresser was lying on its side with two bare legs sticking out from under it.\\xa0 It might have been comical in a different context.</p>\\n<p>The Engineer was stronger than the Ghost was fast, apparently.\\xa0 I wondered if Gordon had helped.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, we got your captive,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou said you\\u2019d explain later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou okay there, Helen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s pleasant, being like this,\\u201d Helen said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cLike I\\u2019m <em>home</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood.\\xa0 Alright.\\xa0 Well, this is a bit of a shot in the dark, but we know what Fray\\u2019s going to be doing, if she isn\\u2019t doing it already.\\xa0 She\\u2019s making a run for it.\\xa0 Everything she\\u2019s been doing up until now has been about consolidating the factions.\\xa0 Presumably.\\xa0 I\\u2019m guessing it\\u2019s going to take a short time to get everything communicated and make sure that the perimeter groups have been pulled in.\\xa0 Too many valuable people at the edges, I imagine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI imagine,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBig problem is the Ghosts.\\xa0 They\\u2019re too effective as scouts.\\xa0 Make her group too slippery.\\xa0 What I\\u2019m hoping is that we can get this one to make a distress cry.\\xa0\\xa0 Maybe, possibly, we can create an <em>illusion</em> of dangerous numbers or a standing army.\\xa0 Fray tries to make a run for it, and a Ghost passes on a message that there\\u2019s something <em>bad</em> in her way.\\xa0 Make her second guess.\\xa0 We turn her tools against her, take away that security.\\xa0 With the weight of a new coalition on her shoulders, maybe that\\u2019s reason to make her balk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave to move her, get ahead of Fray,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEngineer is strong, can carry her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Engineer nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s another problem,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t tell me that.\\xa0 Coming from you-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTheir language doesn\\u2019t work like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart fell.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s more nuanced, and I\\u2019m not sure if I know enough about <em>how</em> to nuance,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Damn.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is why you should share your plans <em>before, </em>not after,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was sort of out of breath, and I wasn\\u2019t sure what the enemy group would look like.\\xa0 If there weren\\u2019t ghosts, the plan was going to change.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeing out of breath isn\\u2019t an excuse.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been <em>telling</em> you to exercise more,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you <em>can</em> let us help come up with plans, sharing what you have.\\xa0 This is definitely not the first or the fifth or the tenth time we\\u2019ve told you this,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I looked around for an ally to help back me up as the pair ganged up on me, and felt only the conspicuous empty space to my right.</p>\\n<p>From the sound of it, Lillian and Petey were making their way upstairs.\\xa0 Small consolation.\\xa0 Lillian was as sure as anyone to get up my butt about what I was doing wrong.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy\\u2019s plan might actually work, though,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p><em>My savior!</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I wanted to let him stew.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou pimpledick.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did too,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou missed the hand signal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPimpleboob.\\xa0 What\\u2019s the new plan?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon didn\\u2019t answer, looking smug as he scratched the top of Hubris\\u2019 head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTime\\u2019s a wasting.\\xa0 Didn\\u2019t you hear me earlier?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI heard,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t elaborate.</p>\\n<p>I could have throttled him, if I wasn\\u2019t sure he would win that struggle and make me look bad in the process.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s Petey,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can use Petey.\\xa0 They\\u2019re not saying because it doesn\\u2019t matter.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re just about my favorite, Helen,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cBuy me a treat later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRemind me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.</p>\\n<p>Petey made her way up the stairs.\\xa0 She looked like she\\u2019d been lightly boiled, she was so red and sweaty.\\xa0 Lillian was right behind her, hair still mussed up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan you take the Ghost?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Petey scowled.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d really rather not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s mission critical,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s like sleeping on a bed of swords,\\u201d Petey said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMission critical, <em>time</em> critical,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe did say we\\u2019d help you out,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe got you what you need to do the most damage.\\xa0 Right here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Petey stared down at the Ghost.\\xa0 I heard a sigh.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen I\\u2019m moving, don\\u2019t interfere.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t \\u2018help\\u2019 me,\\u201d Petey said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause it\\u2019s irritating,\\u201d Petey said.</p>\\n<p>She dropped clumsily to the ground, sitting in an almost-cross-legged position, attention on the Ghost.</p>\\n<p>I leaned against the doorframe, saw Lillian, and then noticed her hair.\\xa0 I reached over to the side of her head and swept my hand through the bit of hair that was sticking up.\\xa0 Lillian started using her fingers to comb it.</p>\\n<p>There were wet, sucking sounds as Petey worked, her body rocking back and forth a little.\\xa0 Gordon stepped behind her to keep her from falling backward.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou all knew what Petey was, huh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust about,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re all the worst,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFilling each other in is important.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to remember you said that,\\u201d he told me.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m going to use it against you so many times.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I rolled my eyes.</p>\\n<p>Petey wasn\\u2019t quick.\\xa0 I saw that Lillian was struggling to work out the messy bit of her hair, stepped closer, and began fixing it myself, picking out bits of grit that hair had rolled itself around.</p>\\n<p>I was preoccupied enough I didn\\u2019t see Petey right away.</p>\\n<p>A fetus, crawling across the hardwood, skin almost translucent, with far too many veins spiderwebbing across the surface.\\xa0 It had been grafted with additional parts, I noted, insect legs that gave it more ability to move in the outside world.\\xa0 All the same, it was no larger than my two fists put side by side.</p>\\n<p>I remembered what the others had said.\\xa0 That Petey was about our age.</p>\\n<p><em>A twelve-year old fetus?</em></p>\\n<p>As Petey made it halfway, I could see his \\u2018tail\\u2019.\\xa0 The spinal column extended back, and was attached to a bag, half-filled with fluid.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrain, in a more malleable, bare-bones package,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIncludes some life support.\\xa0 Tiny body isn\\u2019t big enough to sustain a working, functional brain.\\xa0 Life support keeps him alive until the host body adapts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d almost think that was neat as anything I\\u2019ve heard this week,\\u201d I said, \\u201cBut he\\u2019s so goddamn <em>slow</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh,\\u201d Helen admonished me.\\xa0 \\u201cHe might be able to hear you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope he can!\\u201d I said, raising my voice.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s irritating to be picked up and carried over?\\xa0 It\\u2019s irritating to <em>wait</em>!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Petey stopped mid-crawl, turning <em>very</em> slowly until he was facing my general direction.\\xa0 Delaying more, on purpose.</p>\\n<p>I took a step forward, and raised a foot, threatening to step on him.\\xa0 Lillian grabbed me and pulled me back, before smacking me in the back of the head.</p>\\n<p>Petey resumed crawling, moving hand, foot, and spidery-limb one after the other as he approached the Ghost.\\xa0 He disappeared beneath the shroud of her skirt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI feel a bit queasy,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI might wait downstairs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>This </em>is what breaks you?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cHow much blood and gore and monstrous stuff have you even seen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Ghosts are dumb,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re like animals, with only enough cognition to play at being people, if they have a script.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not sure that makes it any better,\\u201d Lillian said, backing down the stairs.\\xa0 \\u201cOr if it does, it\\u2019s not better enough.\\xa0 You can call me a crybaby all you want, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My mouth opened, then shut.\\xa0 I\\u2019d given lots of thought to the dynamics between Lambs, and to the fact that one Lamb was now gone.\\xa0 Jamie had been my counterpoint, someone I could rely on when my own abilities lacked.\\xa0 In that odd way, he\\u2019d been a support, someone who had my back.\\xa0 He challenged me at the right times and backed me at the right times.</p>\\n<p>I was missing that, just a little bit, a fact that was highlighted by the recent conversation and teasing.\\xa0 There wasn\\u2019t a need to push quite so hard here.</p>\\n<p>I fiddled with the ring at my thumb.\\xa0 \\u201cNah.\\xa0 You\\u2019re good, Lil.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She went back downstairs.\\xa0 The rest of us were left to watch and wait.</p>\\n<p>Petey\\u2019s host jerked.\\xa0 Helen restrained the movements.</p>\\n<p>Then the Ghost reached out one hand, giving Helen\\u2019s hip two light taps.</p>\\n<p>Helen released Petey.</p>\\n<p>Petey\\u2019s movements were awkward, clumsy, and I thought she might fall as he rose to her feet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood to go?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh-\\u201d he started, but his voice was strangled.\\xa0 He paused.\\xa0 \\u201cHm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ghosts couldn\\u2019t speak.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood enough,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/tooth-and-nail-7-2/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>I stirred in response to a knock on my door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNn,\\u201d I managed.</p>\\n<p>I heard the door open, and pulled the covers down from over my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Mrs. Earles said, \\u201cBreakfast.\\xa0 Lillian\\u2019s here, too, so don\\u2019t think you can skip eating this morning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIsn\\u2019t she up and at \\u2019em early in the day.\\xa0 <em>Obligations?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think so, yes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sat up, rubbing at my eyes, then ran my fingers through my hair.\\xa0 It was long, it was shaggy, and I had the worst bed-hair of anyone I knew.\\xa0 I had no illusions about my ability to keep the hair tamed.</p>\\n<p>Mrs. Earles cleared her throat.</p>\\n<p>I looked up, looked at her, and saw her pointed look, just behind me.</p>\\n<p>I twisted around, and saw Mary lying there, head on a second pillow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi, Mrs. Earles,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Behind her, some of the other children had already woken up.\\xa0 I saw Rick step into view, glance at the scene, and smirk.\\xa0 Mrs. Earles saw and shooed him off.</p>\\n<p>I reached under Mary\\u2019s pillow, she smacked my arm, and I withdrew it.</p>\\n<p><em>Fine,</em> I thought.\\xa0 <em>But that\\u2019s going to be a thing</em>.</p>\\n<p>Mrs. Earles positioned herself so that she filled the space between the door and the frame, with little chance of someone peeking or seeing past.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s my habit to avoid asking questions,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat said, given the situation, given that Sy is twelve at most, and you\\u2019re thirteen-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think of myself as a small fourteen,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mrs. Earles gave me a withering look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to ask,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cReally.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mrs. Earles took that in, then nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cI won\\u2019t, then.\\xa0 I was looking for you, Mary, I was worried you\\u2019d gone out earlier than usual to practice your throwing.\\xa0 It\\u2019s good that you\\u2019re here if Lillian needs you.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t take too long getting ready.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 I nodded.</p>\\n<p>The door shut, the latch clicking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like how she takes you at your word,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut when <em>I</em> say something, oh, no.\\xa0 I could tell her the sky is blue and she\\u2019d double-check.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe sky isn\\u2019t usually blue in Radham.\\xa0 It\\u2019s gray at best.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know what I mean.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary swung her feet out from under the covers, standing up from bed, stretching.\\xa0 I hurried to pat down the covers so there were no gaps for the cool air to leak through.</p>\\n<p>I looked past her to Jamie\\u2019s bed.\\xa0 A large notebook sat on the bed, the weight of it messing up what had been a perfectly made, entirely neat bed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI missed my morning exercises,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m so used to the way the sun comes into my room in the morning.\\xa0 Moment it slips over the top of the window and hits my eyes, I\\u2019m out of bed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat sounds like the worst thing ever,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy would you wake up early on purpose?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like it.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a good start to the day, keeps me sharp.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re sharp enough,\\u201d I said, reaching under her pillow for the knife she kept there, holding it up for demonstration.</p>\\n<p>Mary smiled.\\xa0 She reached over, touching my chin to turn my head away.\\xa0 I could still sort of see her in my peripheral vision.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian does it too.\\xa0 The lunatic,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf it wasn\\u2019t for Helen, I\\u2019d think all girls were screwed up somehow.\\xa0 She appreciates a good night\\u2019s sleep.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary was pulling off her night clothes.\\xa0 I fixed my eyes on the ceiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe sleeps with her eyes open sometimes, you know?\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve done stakeouts with her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not the only weird sleep thing.\\xa0 The first night I slept here, she climbed into bed with me.\\xa0 Curled up beside me like a cat, no covers, no pillow, fell straight asleep.\\xa0 One-time thing.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s about affection, or about dominance, or-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInsecurity,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInsecurity.\\xa0 More rational than emotional.\\xa0 \\u2018Keep your enemies closer\\u2019 is a very good tactic when you\\u2019re a Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHa,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not joking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, I know you\\u2019re not joking, but that\\u2019s clever.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomeone should probably mention it to Ibott, but then he\\u2019d want to keep Helen over in his labs so he can observe and train her sleep and blah to that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBlah,\\u201d Mary agreed.\\xa0 She stepped closer to the bed, dressed enough to be decent.\\xa0 I reluctantly sat up, taking a second to rearrange the covers before I took the offered wires and knives.\\xa0 I set to arranging them, with only minimal help from her, while she brushed her hair.</p>\\n<p>A minute passed like that as I set everything up.\\xa0 Mary made only small readjustments.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGotta ask, Sy,\\u201d Mary said, as I wrapped up.\\xa0 She walked over to the rest of her clothes, folded neatly on Jamie\\u2019s chair, pulling on a skirt over her hose-covered legs, \\u201cWhy is this <em>now?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmf,\\u201d I said, letting myself topple over, head hitting pillow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s been nine months.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy the change?\\xa0 Why now?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a topic best saved for a group discussion,\\u201d I said, looking over at Jamie\\u2019s bed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can recall at least three times where you\\u2019ve said something like that, and then you didn\\u2019t bring it up again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan you?\\xa0 My memory isn\\u2019t that good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She gave me a look, finishing buttoning a blouse over her camisole.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d she said, pulling on a sweater.\\xa0 She bounced on the spot, making skirt and hair move and sweater settle into place, then turned to me, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have a mirror, so I have to ask you for the verdict.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery pretty,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood answer,\\u201d she said, seeming satisfied.\\xa0 She smoothed out a wrinkle.\\xa0 \\u201cI should go wake up Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHere, you\\u2019ll need this,\\u201d she said, tossing the brush at me.\\xa0 I let it fall against the covers.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you\\u2019re not out of bed by the time I come back down the hall with her, I\\u2019m going to have her wake you up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I groaned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could give her suggestions on what to do to you,\\u201d she said, as she opened the door, peeking out.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the most humiliating hold?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be out of bed, don\\u2019t worry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr maybe I\\u2019ll get her to chew on you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be out of bed!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd dressed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd dressed!\\xa0 Go away!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary smiled and closed the door behind her.</p>\\n<p>I climbed out of bed, stretching.\\xa0 I shivered a little at the cold, then pulled some clothes out of my dresser.\\xa0 Some shirts were Jamie\\u2019s.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t grown nearly as much as I\\u2019d have liked over nine months, but it was enough to need a different set of clothes, and Jamie had been a bit taller than I was.</p>\\n<p>Button-up shirt, pants, suspenders, jacket.\\xa0 I used Mary\\u2019s brush to try and fix my hair, gave up, and pulled a boy\\u2019s cap over it.\\xa0 I emerged just in time to run into Mary and a dressed-and-combed Helen.\\xa0 Helen had her head on Mary\\u2019s shoulder.\\xa0 As she saw me, Mary gave Helen a light push.\\xa0 Helen staggered my way like a bad stitched.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAhh,\\u201d I said, monotone, a mock cry as Helen draped herself over my back, arms over my shoulders.\\xa0 She swiped my cap off the top fo my head, then lightly bit my scalp.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cArr,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou overheard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told her,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmf, arr,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She adjusted position, mock-biting the top of my head a few more times.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t bite too deep.\\xa0 Sy-meat is poisonous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s totally not true,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t know it\\u2019s not true,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know my <em>blood</em> is poisonous, chemicals floating in it.\\xa0 Stands to reason the rest of me is a <em>little</em> poisonous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen stopped biting me, resting her chin on top of my head instead.\\xa0 \\u201cYou smell like Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably, but could you not mention that in front of others?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cM\\u2019kay,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 Then she made a snoring sound.</p>\\n<p>More than half-asleep.</p>\\n<p>We made our way down the stairs.\\xa0 Helen synchronized her steps with mine, so she wouldn\\u2019t come down a step a half-second after I did and end up driving the hard point of her chin into my skull.</p>\\n<p>As we rounded the corner, making our way down the last leg of the stairs, she pulled away, straightening.\\xa0 She transferred the hat back from her head to mine.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood morning, Helen!\\u201d Eliza, Fran and Iris called out in sync.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood morning!\\u201d Helen said, bright, cheery, without a hint of sleepiness.</p>\\n<p>I rolled my eyes.\\xa0 I rounded the dining table to collect my plate of breakfast, putting a hand on Lillian\\u2019s head to rock it left and right until she knocked my hand away in annoyance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said, looking up from his plate.\\xa0 \\u201cSit here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave him a suspicious look, then gave a more suspicious look to the rugrat sitting beside him.\\xa0 Albert.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause Al here keeps feeding Hubris.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I bent down to peek under the table, at the mutt, then stepped over the bench, interjecting myself between the kid and the beast.</p>\\n<p>Mary and Helen found their seats as well.\\xa0 With Lillian present for this morning\\u2019s breakfast, we naturally filled the empty spot on the bench.</p>\\n<p><em>Just let this meal go by without incident</em>, I thought, staring down at the plate, methodically shoveling food into my mouth.\\xa0 Sausage &amp; mashed potato with onion and boiled vegetables of some sort I\\u2019d never seen before.\\xa0 <em>Don\\u2019t let this be a bad day</em>.</p>\\n<p>With last of us served, Mrs. Earles headed off to start getting the little ones ready.\\xa0 I saw her leave, and I saw <em>Rick</em> watch her leave.</p>\\n<p>I sighed a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo, Sy,\\u201d Rick said.</p>\\n<p>Smug bastard.\\xa0 Smug, round face, smug hair, smug fat ass.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRick, no,\\u201d Gordon said. \\u201cWhatever it is, no.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been on my case for the last year, practically,\\u201d Rick said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNine months,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy, don\\u2019t respond.\\xa0 Rick, shut the hell up, or I will beat you,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie\\u2019s in the hospital, fine, but you keep making me out to be the bad guy, and I\\u2019ve done and said nothing wrong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven if we agree that\\u2019s the case-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is, unless you can tell me what I\\u2019ve said that\\u2019s so awfully bad,\\u201d Rick said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Even if we agree that\\u2019s the case,</em>\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cYou and Sy don\\u2019t get along.\\xa0 Sy\\u2019s missing his best friend-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I clutched my utensils tighter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-and the very best thing you can do is to ignore him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s fair that-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Ignore him</em>,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The little kids who hadn\\u2019t finished eating were staring, silent.</p>\\n<p>Talking very slowly, as if he was spelling things out to a small child, Rick said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s fair that I live in this house and there are people who also live here who I\\u2019m forbidden to talk to or talk <em>about, </em>through no fault of mine.\\xa0 I feel like I and others are kept in the dark sometimes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLife isn\\u2019t fair,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 There were a hundred different things I wanted to tack on to the end of that sentence.\\xa0 There were statements about why Rick hadn\\u2019t been adopted yet that might have made the smaller children cry, and mentions of Jamie that might have made the smaller children cry.\\xa0 I figured it was better to leave things unsaid than to make Mrs. Earles mad at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s well and good, but I want to know what the rules of the house are-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon rose from his seat.\\xa0 He stood there, hands on the table, staring Rick down.</p>\\n<p>Anyone else might have backed down, but Rick only smiled, playing at blithe ignorance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you need to question the rules of the house, ask Mrs. Earles,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Rick said.\\xa0 \\u201cAlright.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what bug crawled up your rear end to make you this strange this morning-\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEw,\\u201d Frances said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-But nothing\\u2019s changed.\\xa0 Leave Sy alone.\\xa0 Leave the subject of Jamie alone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, alright,\\u201d Rick said, throwing his hands up in surrender.</p>\\n<p>The meal continued.\\xa0 I was making more progress than usual, just focusing on eating, eyes on the food.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre we traveling?\\u201d Mary asked, conversationally.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLooks like,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cSchool project.\\xa0 We\\u2019re going to be gone for at least a week.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich train?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s the train with the tea cart you like,\\u201d Lillian assured Helen.</p>\\n<p>Helen smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeen a while since we traveled,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been busy enough,\\u201d Gordon said, as he settled back into his seat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut it\\u2019s been very low-key,\\u201d Mary observed.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they\\u2019re sending you out to get us, that means early train\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich means we\\u2019re rushing, but not so much we\\u2019re having to skip breakfast.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd we\\u2019re probably meeting someone?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s hope,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d Rick said.\\xa0 I gripped my utensils tighter again.\\xa0 I could sense Gordon tensing beside me.\\xa0 Hubris, under the table, was reacting to Gordon\\u2019s body language.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of rude to talk in code, with everyone else at the table.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCode?\\u201d Frances asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s no code,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you mind your own business?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you try carrying on a conversation that includes everyone else at the table?\\u201d Rick asked.\\xa0 I had the impression he was actually irritated enough to show it, for once.\\xa0 \\u201cLike, say, Mary, why weren\\u2019t you in your own bed last night?\\xa0 Do you have anything to tell us?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sighed.\\xa0 I could see the look of confusion on Lillian\\u2019s face.\\xa0 Mary was shaking her head.\\xa0 She signaled something at Gordon I didn\\u2019t catch.\\xa0 Unbeknownst to Rick, Gordon shifted position in his seat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you and Sy a thing now?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The bench, complete with me and the other three people on it, scooted backward, as Gordon pushed it back from the table.\\xa0 I reached for and grabbed my bowl, holding it back out of the way as Gordon traveled around the length of the table to a wide-eyed Rick.</p>\\n<p>Rick was only half out of his seat when Gordon hauled him up and over, throwing him down against the ground.\\xa0 He let Rick get halfway to his feet, then threw the boy into the wall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMrs. Earles!\\u201d Eliza screamed, shrill.</p>\\n<p>Rick was bigger, Gordon was stronger.\\xa0 Every time it looked like Rick was going to get his bearings, Gordon shoved him, or drove him back into the ground with the sole of one foot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you do that again, I\\u2019m going to hit you back!\\u201d Rick called out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStep outside,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon shoved Rick again.\\xa0 Rick\\u2019s head cracked against the wall.\\xa0 I saw some of the girls wince.\\xa0 Helen was among them, but I knew it was for show.</p>\\n<p>Rick raised his hand, starting to throw a punch, and Hubris closed the distance, biting his sleeve, stopping him short.\\xa0 Gordon punched Rick in the collarbone, driving him down to the ground, then grabbed him, sliding him out and through the back door.</p>\\n<p>There were three stone stairs Rick had to roll down to reach the backyard, I knew, though I didn\\u2019t have an angle to see it happen.</p>\\n<p>Shame.</p>\\n<p>I continued eating, polishing off my breakfast.\\xa0 Mrs. Earles came down the stairs, took in the situation, and then stepped outside.</p>\\n<p>I met Lillian\\u2019s eyes, measuring the confusion and the hurt, and shook my head.</p>\\n<p>She gestured under the guise of fixing her hair, <em>lie?</em></p>\\n<p>I nodded a little.</p>\\n<p>I could see her relax a little at that.\\xa0 She had the best vantage point to see the fight, from the end of the other bench.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI guess I need my luggage?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBe right back,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I took my dishes to the sink, rinsed them, and put them on the drying rack.\\xa0 I glanced at the trio of Mrs. Earles, Gordon, and a very sorry looking Rick before taking the stairs two at a time to go upstairs.</p>\\n<p>A set of luggage was always packed, ready to go at a moment\\u2019s notice.\\xa0 Still, I undid the clasps and opened it up, revealing a collection of clothes weighed down by two notebooks.\\xa0 If someone unpacked the clothes, they\\u2019d find the pistol and ammunition, vials of poison, and various small supplies and tools.</p>\\n<p>I walked over to Jamie\\u2019s bed, picked up the notebook there, and put it inside the luggage case, before closing it up again.</p>\\n<p>Heavy, but I didn\\u2019t mind.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNext best thing to having you along with, huh?\\u201d I asked the empty side of the room.</p>\\n<p>I ran my hands down Jamie\\u2019s shirt, making sure I hadn\\u2019t been splashed with anything when Gordon pushed away from the table, or that little Albert hadn\\u2019t dripped on me.\\xa0 I ran my hands through my hair once more, found a tangle, and pulled through it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNext best is pretty fricking lousy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I closed the door behind me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The train car rolled back into motion.\\xa0 People were mostly heading <em>into</em> the city, and those leaving were mostly made up of soldiers and stitched.\\xa0 Seven of the eight train cars were occupied with military forces, the eighth was made up of people.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We\\u2019d been placed in a military car, but even then, we\\u2019d kept conversation to milder things.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When the single squad of soldiers entered and found places to sit on the other end of the car, I said, \\u201cI think we\\u2019re good to have a <em>proper</em> discussion.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe Duke told Hayle the specifics of this job, and Hayle told me to tell you,\\u201d Lillian explained.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cLook who\\u2019s moving up in the world, lil\\u2019 miss Lillian, doing the briefing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian kicked at me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat are we after?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat we know is that some major players have disappeared from cities where they had bases of operations.\\xa0 Leadership for the firebrands and the spears, doctors working for either side, some experiments and projects they were keeping an eye on, most picked up and moved.\\xa0 Something about the timing of it, it raised eyebrows?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">From the way she phrased that last statement, I figured she wasn\\u2019t sure about her recall.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re doing fine,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt makes sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian returned the praise with a smile that had little confidence.\\xa0 Or was it because it was Mary?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBoth groups up and leaving at the same time.\\xa0 They\\u2019re communicating,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey are,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhich is strange because the ideologies have been diverging.\\xa0 There\\u2019s even been skirmishes between the two groups, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cRight,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He had a minor scuff mark on his nose, but it was his only wound from what had been a pretty thorough thrashing of Rick.\\xa0 I suspected it was from an unexpected swing of the arm as Rick flailed around, rather than anything intentional on Rick\\u2019s part.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Hubris was in the train car with us, draped over the seat next to Gordon, head in Gordon\\u2019s lap.\\xa0 The animal was a fighting breed, square-headed, eyes obscured by bushy brows.\\xa0 Even with the coarse, rust-colored fur that covered him, Hubris\\u2019 raw strength was apparent at a glance.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSkirmishes between two groups, now sudden cooperation.\\xa0 The higher ups are <em>pretty</em> sure that someone\\u2019s stepping in.\\xa0 There\\u2019s some speculation that Cynthia is healed and ready to coordinate,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cBut, well\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe know she\\u2019s been active on and off,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWorking for the spears, focused on the Crown.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCould be a deception,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCould,\\u201d I admitted.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMost of the people who\\u2019ve been paying attention agree it\\u2019s Fray,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe have spies paying attention to the trains and roads, and we\\u2019re pretty clear about the <em>city</em> they\\u2019ve gone to, but we don\\u2019t know where.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cA diplomatic meeting,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cAll of our enemies in one place?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat\\u2019s the expectation,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf the Academy brings too much force to bear in advance, we might scare them off.\\xa0 If they move blind, they risk missing the window of opportunity when they can\\u2019t find the targets.\\xa0 We\\u2019re part of a limited scouting force, working with a few others.\\xa0 Dog and Catcher will be there, but it\\u2019ll mostly be groups from other Academies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey spent the initial momentum,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey needed victories to carry that momentum forward, and they didn\\u2019t have enough of those.\\xa0 Losing Cynthia for as long as they did, they took the only option they had, splitting up, narrowing focus, trying to reinvent themselves based on area and personalities, in order to revive things some.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cFocus on anti-Crown sentiment in anti-Crown areas, anti-Academy sentiment in areas where people chafe most with the Academies,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBut that\\u2019s a hard fire to keep stoked without fresh fuel.\\xa0 It\\u2019s been a couple of months and people are tired of fighting,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe anger is there, but it\\u2019s not fresh, hot anger.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWar peters out, things mostly settle until the next big excuse, the next war, the next revolution, whatever,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBoth sides know it, banding together is the only way to stay strong enough to stay in the fight, but ideologies have diverged too much, they\\u2019ve been competing with one another, they need someone very strong or very clever to unite the groups.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe person who started the war in the first place,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot that they know that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary leaned forward.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re not stupid.\\xa0 They\\u2019re going to be covering their asses seven ways from Sunday.\\xa0 Bodyguards, protection, counter-assassins\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cI guess they\\u2019ve decided we\\u2019re ready.\\xa0 No more soft-lobs to the Lambs.\\xa0 We tackle this one man down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAbout that,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I brought my head back until it rested against the window.\\xa0 \\u201cI jinxed it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry, Sy,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAshton?\\u201d\\xa0 I left the other half of the question unasked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 There was a long, painful pause, then she said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s been in classes with-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said, cutting her off.</p>\\n<p>Silence lingered among the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said, a little more brightly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou knew, didn\\u2019t you?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThis morning, when we were talking, you said there was something to discuss later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I spread my arms.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been peeking at files now and again.\\xa0 Keeping tabs.\\xa0 It doesn\\u2019t matter.\\xa0 I knew it was coming.\\xa0 They\\u2019re buffering our numbers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>And I\\u2019m having trouble dealing, in little ways, while that weighs on me.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow long until he shows?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf not tomorrow, then the day after,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe finish before then,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf he shows, he shows.\\xa0 But we\\u2019ll have this wrapped up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be disruptive, okay?\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNewbie joining the group?\\xa0 Because he <em>will</em> be new.\\xa0 There\\u2019s adjustment, any time we add someone.\\xa0 There\\u2019s emotional stuff to deal with, I admit it, I\\u2019m going to have to get a handle on it, and I\\u2019m probably going to suck at it.\\xa0 I know the rest of you will too, to varying degrees.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked between each of the Lambs in turn.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been upfront about how I\\u2019m doing and how I\\u2019m coping, so you aren\\u2019t surprised.\\xa0 What I\\u2019m saying there, it\\u2019s part of it.\\xa0 You know I\\u2019m right.\\xa0 Given what we\\u2019re up against, I don\\u2019t want any wrenches in the works to make it even harder, for you guys, for me, for our plans, for coordination.\\xa0 We do this clean, we do it in top form, and we do it fast.\\xa0 If he shows, he finds the job done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know you can\\u2019t run away from this forever,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we succeed, we might scatter them to the wind, and we\\u2019re going to get a half-dozen missions one after the other, chasing after the most dangerous and cunning of the survivors, cleaning up.\\xa0 If we fail and Fray comes out ahead, then we\\u2019re going to be asked to deal with whatever messes she concocts.\\xa0 There won\\u2019t be downtime like we\\u2019ve had.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLikely one or the other, Sy.\\xa0 If they think we\\u2019re ready to get back into the game, we\\u2019re going to have to be ready.\\xa0 You\\u2019re going to have to deal with the adjustments without breaking stride.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t talking about Ashton.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust making sure you know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He reached over to give me a pat on the shoulder.</p>\\n<p>The train slowed.\\xa0 My eyebrows went up, and I twisted around a hundred and eighty degrees to look out the window.</p>\\n<p>I turned, asking Jamie, \\u201cDoes the map-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I finished turning, pausing as I looked at the pale white curtain beside the window, opposite me.\\xa0 It had looked different out of the corner of my eye.</p>\\n<p><em>Forgot</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re there already?\\u201d I asked, barely missing a beat.</p>\\n<p>Nobody commented, except for Gordon to say, \\u201cWe were on the outskirts of town.\\xa0 We\\u2019re heading into the city proper.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I managed a smile.\\xa0 \\u201cGood debrief, Lil.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 Then she kicked me, hard.\\xa0 \\u201cBut don\\u2019t call me Lil.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smirked.</p>\\n<p>The train slowed to a halt.\\xa0 The soldiers in the car with us waited patiently as we collected our luggage.</p>\\n<p>We made our way out onto the platform, doing what we could to work through the crowd.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t even need to be said, but if <em>we</em> could keep an eye on the train stations, <em>they</em> could as well.</p>\\n<p>Our quiet, careful movements were interrupted as we collectively came to a halt.\\xa0 The soldiers in front of us had, too, so it wasn\\u2019t too damning.</p>\\n<p>Heads craned, and we stared.</p>\\n<p>The city sprawled, a proper city, with several skyscrapers, trees growing freely, and other design touches.\\xa0 One building looked like half of it had been peeled away to reveal a great stone giant, flensed of flesh but not muscle or organ.\\xa0 An anatomical figure crossed with architecture.</p>\\n<p>A proper Academy city, as Radham was.</p>\\n<p>Except for the fact that the largest set of structures sitting atop the highest hill in the city were on fire.\\xa0 I was guessing from the look of it that it would be a lack of fuel rather than anything else that saw it go out.\\xa0 It looked pretty damn thorough.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t suppose that\\u2019s our rendezvous point?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh,\\u201d I said, brightly.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s inconvenient.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/27/tooth-and-nail-7-4/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>We deposited our bags at the side of one gate, getting the attention of the soldiers there, asking them to look after the luggage.</p>\\n<p>While Lillian got her things ready, I quickly grabbed the three books from my bag and put them into a backpack, pulling it on.\\xa0 Heavy, but not so much it would weigh me down or impact my performance.</p>\\n<p>Wasn\\u2019t willing to leave Jamie\\u2019s books behind.\\xa0 No way, no how.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI get to try my new ears,\\u201d Helen was telling the woman with the apron.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNew ears?\\u201d Gordon asked, turning around.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy maker gave them to me, after I said I almost couldn\\u2019t hear the Ghosts.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know if I hear better, but I hear <em>more</em>, except it\\u2019s not like that.\\xa0 The range is different?\\xa0 Oh, but we have to explain who the Ghosts are!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe ones with spines inside them,\\u201d I said, trying to provide a bit of sanity in the midst of Helen\\u2019s ramblings.\\xa0 \\u201cEcholocation.\\xa0 Perfect sensory awareness in an area.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve run into them,\\u201d the woman with the apron said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe were hired to find and eliminate cells a few months ago.\\xa0 They keep cropping back up, but I think we\\u2019re keeping it more or less under control.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I adjusted the straps on my backpack, ignoring the looks from the others.\\xa0 They still weren\\u2019t asking or saying anything about it.</p>\\n<p>We set off through the gates.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI got new ears, and Professor Ibott is changing some of my joints around, because he wants to make sure I develop right as I grow up, without anything getting too rigid, so my shoulders and hips feel a little funny right now, and he\\u2019s talking about shaving bones and putting in bone spurs, and, um, what else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a lot of changes,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause I\\u2019m starting puberty!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I felt a bit of a chill.\\xa0 Just to the side of me, Gordon muttered something along the lines of, \\u201cOh hell.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI actually started half a year ago, but Ibott feels like I\\u2019m ready now, and because I won\\u2019t change unless he makes me change, and I could look really weird without the right attention, he\\u2019s been plotting out what I need and what works and things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>The</em> Ibott?\\u201d the woman with the apron asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep!\\xa0 And he\\u2019s going to make me more dangerous and he\\u2019s going to make me gorgeous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou <em>are</em> gorgeous, dum-dum,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 She smiled at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOut of the mouth of babes,\\u201d the Wry Man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI envy you your ability to say what comes to mind.\\xa0 It isn\\u2019t so easy when you\\u2019re a hideous old man.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI dunno, I think I\\u2019ll still say stuff like that when I\\u2019m grown up,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>If I grow up</em>.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen is gorgeous.\\xa0 She was put together with an artist\\u2019s hand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen nodded, then smiled, \\u201cUh huh, but I\\u2019m supposed to be gorgeous enough in two or three years to lure in the sort of man of weaker morals.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a different kind of gorgeous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA touch disturbing,\\u201d the Wry Man commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen\\u2019s not usually this talkative, just so you know,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like new people.\\xa0 I get excited about new people, and I\\u2019m excited about getting improved!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe disturbing part of it is typical for when she does get going, though,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPooh to you both.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI envy you,\\u201d the woman with the apron said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt sounds nice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re Petey, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve heard about you.\\xa0 How\\u2019s your body doing today?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m so-so, thank you for asking,\\u201d the woman in the apron said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m good to fight if I have to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe might have to,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s apparently enough of them in town that we\\u2019re going to run into <em>someone.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr something,\\u201d I added.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be ready,\\u201d Petey said, smacking one fist into the flat of the other hand.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure but I suspected <em>I</em> could have been more menacing than she\\u2019d been in that moment.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t like the layout,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere isn\\u2019t much cover, there aren\\u2019t many good vantage points, and everywhere we go, people are watching us from those tiny windows.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s after curfew,\\u201d the Wry Man said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe fire got a lot of people\\u2019s attention.\\xa0 They may be keeping an eye out for clues about what\\u2019s happening.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t like not having escape routes,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She looked up, \\u201cCan we get up to the rooftops and use them to navigate?\\xa0 I\\u2019d feel like we had more freedom.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can.\\xa0 There aren\\u2019t many options to get up onto the rooftops, and the ones that do exist are watched,\\u201d the Wry Man said.\\xa0 \\u201cGoing up carelessly can get you shot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not very athletic,\\u201d Petey said, \\u201cBut we can if we have to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I narrowed my eyes a little, trying to figure Petey out.</p>\\n<p>She smiled at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnd of this road,\\u201d the Wry Man said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s a tower.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The winding path and the buildings that blocked the view made it hard to tell just how far the \\u2018end of this road\\u2019 was.\\xa0 As far as I could tell, the road curved to the right fifty feet in front of us.\\xa0 As we made our way forward, I could see around the corner, revealing a gentle left turn, again taking the road somewhere I couldn\\u2019t see.</p>\\n<p>It was claustrophobic, even with the open sky above us and the open paths behind and in front of us.\\xa0 The sky wasn\\u2019t a place we could travel, and there was no telling what exactly was around the next bend.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI kind of agree with what Mary was saying,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis place <em>sucks.\\xa0 </em>I\\u2019m going to get so lost.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can remember the paths and get a sense of the layout,\\u201d the Wry Man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe <em>you</em> can, but my memory is bad.\\xa0 The way it\\u2019s wired.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen I can see it being a problem,\\u201d the Wry Man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStick with us,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI should have a sense of Brechwell\\u2019s layout, though it\\u2019s going to take me a little while.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s memory was strong, but it didn\\u2019t compare to Jamie\\u2019s.\\xa0 We\\u2019d been put together with a certain idea in mind, and one of us was gone now.\\xa0 There was a lack.</p>\\n<p>I could improvise to fill some of that lack.\\xa0 Gordon could shore it up with his limited ability.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t feel like enough.</p>\\n<p>It wouldn\\u2019t have felt like enough if <em>all of us</em> had Jamie\\u2019s memory capacity.</p>\\n<p>We rounded the bend, and Helen tilted her head.\\xa0 \\u201cShh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hubris\\u2019 ears had perked up as well.</p>\\n<p>I heard nothing, but the girl and the dog were paying rapt attention.</p>\\n<p>In the distance, well behind us, a structure collapsed, weakened too much by the fire.\\xa0 Helen turned and gave the blazing Brechwell Academy an annoyed look, as if it was somehow the fault of the buildings.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGhosts,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDirection?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She pointed.</p>\\n<p>We moved more briskly now.\\xa0 I would have liked to say we were quiet, but Petey\\u2019s boots were heavy on the road.\\xa0 Helen pulled a little bit ahead, paused, then pointed again.</p>\\n<p>Twice, we changed routes.\\xa0 Paths met, intersected, and branched, and we chased an enemy that never seemed to appear.\\xa0 Hubris\\u2019 nose was working overtime, as he snuffled at the ground.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hear Dog too,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s up there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was pointing at rooftops, further down the street.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll go up,\\u201d the Wry Man said.</p>\\n<p>The streets wound like snakes in the midst of death throes, lined on either side by narrow two-and-three story houses that bled into one another, most houses set with one directly to the left, right, and behind.\\xa0 I could see tree-tops where there were wider gaps between houses left some space.\\xa0 Secluded patches of green, each one locked off by the triangle or square of houses laid out around them.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t imagine kids running around in those parks.\\xa0 It made me think of prisons.</p>\\n<p>But each time a street ended, there was a tower.\\xa0 The towers were military emplacements, sturdy, thick, and taller than any of the buildings around.\\xa0 The front gate was locked, but a ladder led up the side.</p>\\n<p>The Wry Man went first.\\xa0 He made it up a short distance, only two of us below him, when a spotlight targeted him, sliding down to take the rest of us in.\\xa0 I squinted against the white glare, almost started to adjust, and then it flickered, as electric things tended to do.\\xa0 I blinked the spots out of my eyes, and hoped they weren\\u2019t training a rifle on us.</p>\\n<p>The Wry Man had raised a hand, as if waving, and was poised, holding position.</p>\\n<p>The light went off, then on, then off again.</p>\\n<p>He resumed climbing.</p>\\n<p><em>Brechwell brooks no nonsense,</em> I thought.\\xa0 The claustrophobic feeling was getting worse.</p>\\n<p>The light fixed on us as we stepped off the ladder and onto rooftop.\\xa0 The Wry Man gestured, pointing downward, and the light disappeared.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cParanoid,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe location makes Brechwell a prime target,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cMilitary base staffed with students who have their careers riding on this, eager to show their worth.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My footing on the rooftop was tentative, as I tried to judge how slick the shingles were, and how much traction I had on the sloped surface.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI dunno,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI tend to default to assume that people get lazy.\\xa0 We gravitate toward shortcuts.\\xa0 Stick a bunch of people in military academies, they\\u2019re going to be good as gold while they\\u2019re being watched, but stick them in a watchtower, without oversight?\\xa0 I can\\u2019t believe they wouldn\\u2019t goof off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t believe in discipline?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cDetermination?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI believe in it, but I think it\\u2019s an anomaly more than the rule.\\xa0 You only get quality if you set people against each other.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey get bonus marks for ratting each other out,\\u201d the Wry Man said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd they do get tested with regular drills during peacetime.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I spread my hands.\\xa0 \\u201cThere you go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The remainder of the group made their way up.\\xa0 Helen had Hubris under one arm, and was climbing the ladder one-handed.\\xa0 She handed off Hubris to Gordon, then stepped up alongside the rest of us.\\xa0 Petey followed, huffing, with Lillian last.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a solo operator?\\u201d I asked Petey.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI am, yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd what you said before, you\\u2019ve cleared out an entire cell of Ghosts by yourself?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t be rude.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have,\\u201d Petey said, in the same moment I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m not being rude.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBe nice,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He kept a hand on Hubris\\u2019 side, but the dog wasn\\u2019t having trouble walking on the shingles.\\xa0 It was a sheer three or four story drop to the road on either side, and there was little to stop any of us if we were to start sliding.</p>\\n<p>Petey lurched, and it took two of us to catch her.</p>\\n<p>I asked, \\u201cOkay, so is it hidden weapons, or some plague or\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNeither.\\xa0 Well, I\\u2019m sort of a hidden weapon, myself,\\u201d she said, in that strange voice of hers.\\xa0 \\u201cUndercover.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood cover,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mary jabbed me.</p>\\n<p>From our vantage point, I could see the expanse of the city, including the maze-like distribution of streets and houses, with bridges and gates here and there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can go that way,\\u201d Gordon said, pointing.\\xa0 The rooftops on one side of the street extended over a bridge to cross to the other.\\xa0 \\u201cWe could make good distance before we have to go down and back up again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUgh,\\u201d Petey said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we\\u2019re quick, we can cut them off,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd we won\\u2019t have to go up and down,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen let\\u2019s hurry!\\u201d Petey said, now enthusiastic.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo by two,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHold hands.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That got me some weird looks.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrust me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mary extended a hand to Gordon, who took it.\\xa0 The two of them took the lead, taking off.</p>\\n<p>Without wasting a second, I grabbed Lillian\\u2019s wrist.\\xa0 She looked a little startled, staring at me with wet hair clinging to the sides of her face and edge of her chin, but she clasped her hand around my wrist in turn.\\xa0 I would have and could have explained my rationale, but time counted.</p>\\n<p>Our combination left an odd pairing.\\xa0 With a member missing, we had one odd member out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWry, can you go with Petey?\\xa0 Helen isn\\u2019t about to slip.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wry nodded.</p>\\n<p>That said, I tugged on Lillian\\u2019s wrist, and pulled her along behind me.</p>\\n<p>Walking on a peaked roof with its subtle slope, it was hard to run across the peak, with each foot angling out in opposite directions.\\xa0 It led to an awkward, bow-legged run, one with a higher chance of stumbling, not a lower one.</p>\\n<p>Holding hands, we were each able to angle our bodies slightly to one side, more or less placing our feet flat.\\xa0 With my weight counterbalanced by Lillian\\u2019s, I didn\\u2019t need to worry so much about sliding.\\xa0 If something happened, she and I together had a better chance of avoiding a fall than one of us alone.</p>\\n<p>Her hand was so warm, with the weather so chilling.\\xa0 Her breath fogged slightly as she huffed out breaths, working to keep up with me.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Mary made it look so easy.\\xa0 Their weights weren\\u2019t matched by half, Gordon was growing in a way I wasn\\u2019t, but they were both athletic, and both knew exactly what they were doing.\\xa0 Hubris ran just behind them, enjoying the fact that he had four paws for extra traction.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t glance back at Helen, Petey and the Wry Man.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHere!\\u201d Helen called out.</p>\\n<p>We stopped.</p>\\n<p>She was pointing, tracing the path the Ghosts were traveling.</p>\\n<p>They were moving at the base of the houses we were running on, letting the eaves and the edges of the rooftops block our view.</p>\\n<p>Gordon pointed to a path, I signaled agreement.</p>\\n<p>The path available to us was shaped like an \\u2018H\\u2019, with a covered bridge joining rooftops on this side of the street with rooftops on the other.</p>\\n<p>We traveled along the middle bar, and as we did, the Ghosts came into view.\\xa0 They realized we were getting ahead of them and stopped for a moment to communicate before reversing direction.\\xa0 We adjusted our course, and they stopped once again.</p>\\n<p>I imagined the claustrophobia I\\u2019d experienced before, only it was imposed on our enemy this time.\\xa0 We had the high ground, we could easily spy them, and the fact that we weren\\u2019t confined to winding, twisting streets meant we could easily stay ahead of them.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure we could actually confront them, if it came down to it, because we still had to get from the rooftops to the ground, but if they carried on like this, we could track them wherever they decided to take shelter, or at least flag down the next group of soldiers to travel down the road.</p>\\n<p><em>What are you going to do now?</em></p>\\n<p>I was surprised at how much venom there was in my thoughts.\\xa0 Not quite anger, but a part of me wanted to see them take a bullet.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure if it had anything to do with the fact that they were <em>children.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re cornered.\\xa0 In a sense,\\u201d Gordon remarked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere do we take this from here?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 She looked at the Wry Man.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat did you do, when you were cleaning up other camps?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man used his thumb to pull back the corner of his jacket.\\xa0 Small vials sat side by side, ringing his belt.\\xa0 Each one was corked.\\xa0 \\u201cI worked with the locals, but I had some chemical help.\\xa0 Not much good here.\\xa0 Nothing I can drink that\\u2019s about to let me hop right down there and kill or capture either of them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cPush someone into a corner, strip away their defenses, and you\\u2019ll see their true selves.\\xa0 Them?\\xa0 They\\u2019re survivors at their core.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll do what it takes to live, and I\\u2019m thinking that means they\\u2019re going to run like little rabbits, all the way home.\\xa0 All we have to do is keep up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUgh,\\u201d Petey said.\\xa0 \\u201cI hate exercise.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned at Petey, and was about to ask for more particulars on just how she was a weapon, when Helen\\u2019s hands went to her ears.\\xa0 Hubris shook his head, and it wasn\\u2019t because he\\u2019d gotten wet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t hear you,\\u201d Helen replied.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve got my hands-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon gestured, firm, quick movements.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re screaming.\\xa0 Sounds different.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at the pair, who hadn\\u2019t budged.\\xa0 Their mouths were closed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho has a whistle to call Dog?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cBut it\\u2019s in my bag.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGet it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re calling for help,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re not going to run home.\\xa0 They\\u2019re bringing \\u2018home\\u2019 here.\\xa0 We should let them go.\\xa0 Everything that\\u2019s helping us keep them cornered is working against us if they mount an attack.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Multiple paths of travel, the exposure, the vantage point</em>.</p>\\n<p>Hubris turned, facing the opposite direction, and made a growling sound.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore Ghosts,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>But as the figures stepped out of one building, a cluster of people, I saw a man in their midst.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t a Percy.</p>\\n<p>Something about the way they talked, walking briskly along the winding road that would take them to the Ghosts, it was too social, too verbal.\\xa0 Their clothes were too\\u2026 individual, if I had to say.\\xa0 Three women and a man.\\xa0 One woman and the man had messy brown hair, in dire need of a wash.\\xa0 The other two women were wearing modified military jackets, with badges and everything else removed.\\xa0 Two carried guns.</p>\\n<p>I instinctively dropped closer to the roof itself.</p>\\n<p>If they were Ghosts, they would have been using the silent Ghost-speak, I was sure.</p>\\n<p>Yet they\\u2019d responded to the cry for help.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gestured.\\xa0 He was taking charge.\\xa0 We were relocating, finding a more defensible point.\\xa0 Getting closer to a watchtower with an active spotlight was vital, here.</p>\\n<p>The trip took us just above the Ghosts, who weren\\u2019t budging and who were presumably screaming.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere, look,\\u201d Mary whispered.</p>\\n<p>We could see further down, along the winding road.\\xa0 A group that wasn\\u2019t the messy-haired not-Ghosts from before was approaching, perhaps twenty individuals strong.</p>\\n<p>One or two Ghosts, but many of the others weren\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>Plague men, yes, but other things.\\xa0 There were the combat-druggers, who\\u2019d altered in shape and form, who had veins sticking out, and who walked a little separate from the rest of the group.\\xa0 Gone feral, made more dangerous, but at a cost of humanity, unpredictable enough that their own allies avoided them.</p>\\n<p>I could identify leaders by the attention people gave to them.</p>\\n<p>A giant of a man, with plague man alterations, but something told me that if he hadn\\u2019t had the plague man effect, he still would have been something of a monster.\\xa0 He rippled with muscle, wearing only a long coat, and tubes fed into his neck and chest.\\xa0 His hair was long, and he walked in a way that suggested he expected nothing to get in his way.</p>\\n<p>His weapon was mechanical, long and toothed.</p>\\n<p><em>Weaponized birthing saw</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>There were others.\\xa0 Someone who wore a lab coat, with a custom warbeast at his side, and a woman with long hair, fur at the edge of her hood, and draping clothing to the ground.</p>\\n<p>The woman reminded me of Helen.</p>\\n<p><em>Special projects.\\xa0 Scrapped ones, ones that turned coat, and worse.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho are they?\\u201d I whispered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe man is one of the Firebrand\\u2019s lieutenants, special project of Orickton\\u2019s Academy,\\u201d the Wry Man said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe killed his doctor and was locked up.\\xa0 The Firebrands released him.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know the others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe either,\\u201d Petey said.</p>\\n<p>I bit my tongue, thought for a second, and then said, \\u201cSafe to assume the other two are just as dangerous?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be a high bar to meet,\\u201d the Wry Man said.</p>\\n<p>In the distance, I could see Dog and Catcher appear on a rooftop.\\xa0 Catcher raised both hands, then moved them.</p>\\n<p>Gordon started to gesture back, then paused.\\xa0 \\u201cWe retreat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe retreat,\\u201d the Wry Man said, without asking for input.</p>\\n<p>I bit my tongue harder.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gestured to Catcher, who gestured back before disappearing.</p>\\n<p>Then we were gone, putting as much distance between ourselves and the small army as we could.</p>\\n<p>I knew, instinctually, that it was too dangerous.\\xa0 I knew we were outclassed, and there was so little we could have done.\\xa0 Dog and Catcher would have some input, we could connect dots in the meantime, figure out a plan of action, rally the local forces, even.</p>\\n<p>Yet a part of me told me that Jamie would have known who they were.\\xa0 Jamie would have known strengths and weaknesses or what the projects were.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d still be retreating, but I\\u2019d feel better about what came next.</p>\\n<p>We needed a win, and we needed it soon, if only to prove we weren\\u2019t diminished.\\xa0 This was a weakness that would infect the group, influence me, with all of my vulnerability to being swayed one way or the other.</p>\\n<p>Lillian squeezed my wrist, and I realized I was still holding hers.</p>\\n<p>I squeezed hers back.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/24/tooth-and-nail-7-3/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>We rode on the back of a wagon, bumping and jostling as much as the twelve or so crates that were stacked back there with our luggage.\\xa0 The crates had straps keeping them in place, which I envied.\\xa0 My hands were already cramping up, and we weren\\u2019t even halfway to our destination.</p>\\n<p>On either side of the wagon, soldiers were standing with the toes of their boots wedged between two rails, holding onto straps.\\xa0 Smaller warbeasts walked alongside, more like jungle cats in proportion and fluidity of movement, and squadrons of stitched marched doubletime in front of and behind us.</p>\\n<p>It was dusk, but the city was well lit \\u2013 the neighborhood-scale bonfire notwithstanding.\\xa0 Brechwell was an interesting city in terms of layout.\\xa0 Radham had developed an Academy first, the city following naturally, with the Crown and Academy both taking a periodic hand to the development of that city in stages, as needs developed.\\xa0 It was loose, a design I\\u2019d often likened to a living body, every part having a purpose, or to a tree, pruned now and again, parts cut away or used for resources as needed, be it the tree-like growths that supported structures, entire neighborhoods, or even sweeping districts of the city.</p>\\n<p>Those parts of Radham were sloppy, though, the result of a long series of successful accidents, the mistakes done away with.\\xa0 Brechwell was the opposite, in a way.\\xa0 It had been a military base first, and the Academy had been plopped down on top of it at a later point, the Academy adapting to the needs of the city and the area.</p>\\n<p>The streets were winding, just wide enough for two carts to pass side by side, very occasionally twisting to pass other under streets, through short tunnels that had portcullis gates at either end.\\xa0 Buildings were made up predominantly of stone, with only aesthetic touches of vines, ivy, or branches, a stark contrast to Radham.\\xa0 The roads were cobblestone, neatly fit together, and segued neatly into the base of each row of buildings, leaving me feeling as if we were traveling along the lowest point of a series of deep, wide trenches.</p>\\n<p>Every surface was soaked wet by the cold rain that poured down from above.\\xa0 They looked alive, they looked <em>cold</em>, and if I unfocused my eyes, I had the vague impression that this city was reptilian.\\xa0 The stones akin to scales, slick with moisture.\\xa0 Only half of the windows were lit, and they were so small I doubted <em>I</em> could have crawled through them, high off the ground, and often round or narrow.\\xa0 I imagined the eyes of serpents, narrowed, catching the light.</p>\\n<p>Soldiers at either end of the wagon were eyeing us.\\xa0 We\\u2019d approached superior officers with badges in hand, and they\\u2019d agreed to escort us up.\\xa0 The foot soldiers hadn\\u2019t been filled in, and were wondering at the odd addition to their ranks.</p>\\n<p>We ceased going uphill, settling onto more level ground.\\xa0 I stopped feeling like I was going to bounce off the back of the wagon with every bump, and shifted my weight around, reaching back to hold on to a strap with one hand.\\xa0 My other hand reached out for Hubris\\u2019 furry head.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t react in the slightest.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, for his part, reached out to give Hubris a brief rub.\\xa0 The dog turned his head to better position it for Gordon\\u2019s scratches.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to be an honorary member of the group, you\\u2019d better learn to play nice with others, mutt,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe you just suck at giving scratches,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr he might like you better if you called him by his name.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe you smell like a butt, but you don\\u2019t hear me bringing it up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He rolled his eyes.</p>\\n<p>We came to a stop in the midst of a checkpoint, and waited as a squad of soldiers checked over the wagon.</p>\\n<p>Lillian and Mary were talking, with Helen sitting nearby, listening more than participating.\\xa0 Rather than listen in on the secret lives of girls, I turned my attention to the front of the wagon.</p>\\n<p>The officers in charge of the group were riding up front, leaning forward as they exchanged words with the group at the checkpoint.\\xa0 I could only pick out segments of the conversation.</p>\\n<p><em>\\u201c</em>Same as last night\\u2026\\xa0 four of them, led by someone different\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow many nights?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>\\u201c</em>Last night\\u2026\\u201d something something \\u201c\\u2026the night before.\\xa0 Different types of attack.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026time?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSame time.\\xa0 The freaks from out-of-town\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man at the front of the wagon cut the checkpoint officer off right there.\\xa0 I saw him turn his head to look our way.</p>\\n<p>I raised my hand, giving a short wave.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThem?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFrom Radham.\\xa0 They\\u2019re-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lambs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 The Lambs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The checkpoint guard lowered his voice, but I could still make it out.\\xa0 \\u201cShit, I thought they\\u2019d be uglier.\\xa0 Shriveled?\\xa0 Or like small stitched?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNope.\\xa0 Apparently they look like ordinary children.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I watched as the search of the wagon progressed to the back.\\xa0 I raised my arms, feet still dangling over the end, and patiently underwent the pat-down.\\xa0 Mary faced a little more trouble.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have weapons,\\u201d Mary said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t want you to be surprised-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHands on your head,\\u201d the soldier told her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not listening to me,\\u201d Mary said, not listening.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you pat me down and you aren\\u2019t careful, you\\u2019re going to get cut.\\xa0 You-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen grabbed Mary\\u2019s wrists, lifting her hands up, before firmly pressing them down on top of Mary\\u2019s head.</p>\\n<p>The guard pat her down, his expression changing as he stopped mid-pat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m telling you-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked from the scene to the commanding officers, who were still embroiled in a discussion.\\xa0 Interesting that he hadn\\u2019t called for his superior officer\\u2019s attention.\\xa0 What was the relationship like, there?</p>\\n<p><em>Let\\u2019s see if this works</em>.</p>\\n<p>I leaned closer to the other side of the wagon, where the girls were.\\xa0 \\u201cSir?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cQuiet,\\u201d he told me, automatic, sounding tense.\\xa0 Grumpy fellow.</p>\\n<p>I pulled out my badge.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re the Lambs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw his expression change.\\xa0 Momentary confusion, then he pulled the particulars from memory.\\xa0 The uniforms who were at either side of the wagon reacted, murmuring quietly among themselves.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 He squinted at the badge.\\xa0 He indicated the superior officers, \\u201cThey know about this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re discussing us right now,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He let go of Mary, gesturing that she could put her arms down.\\xa0 He looked at us, giving us a concerned look.</p>\\n<p>The man in uniform who\\u2019d been patting me down commented, \\u201cI thought you\\u2019d look more like dolls or something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour boss just said something like that,\\u201d I commented.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat stories are they telling about us, anyway?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe slaughter in Whitney?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 \\u201cGroup passed through to get information on prisoners of war, brought back stories.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah, that was a night.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd some man in Iverness?\\xa0 Every other bone in his body broken?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t remember that one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lonely Man,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh!\\xa0 Yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was me,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMight\\u2019ve been better if we didn\\u2019t actually broadcast who we were and that we\\u2019re here,\\u201d Gordon commented, under his breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey know we\\u2019re here,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they don\\u2019t know already, then they\\u2019re so incompetent we don\\u2019t need to worry in the first place.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t do that thing where you get in a mood and start taking chances,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not.\\xa0 I\\u2019m being realistic.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm, yeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 Hubris nudged his arm, and he gave the dog a scratch.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s with the fire?\\u201d I asked one of the soldiers.\\xa0 \\u201cThird attack in as many nights?\\xa0 Same time of day?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cExcept this one is bad.\\xa0 Everything they could set fire to, they did.\\xa0 Mostly stone there, but they got indoors, and floorboards are floorboards.\\xa0 The library is the part that\\u2019s going to hurt most.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh no!\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI really wanted to see the library.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was overrated,\\u201d one of the soldiers said.\\xa0 By his badge, he was one of the ones who looked after the stitched who were lined up against the walls of the tunnel.\\xa0 He was young, fresh faced enough I doubted he could grow facial hair if he wanted, and kept straight, neatly-parted black hair under his military cap.\\xa0 \\u201cProfessor Tobermory talked it up quite a bit, but it\\u2019s small, more about decoration, hunting trophies on the wall.\\xa0 I think anyone who had anything nice to say about it had a lot of drink pushed at them by Tobermory.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was that bad?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t know,\\u201d the man replied.\\xa0 \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t impressed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPhooey,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a student?\\u201d the young man asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought you were a Lamb.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBoth.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded, taking that in.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat year?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThird, but my schedule is bumpy.\\xa0 I spend a lot of time out of school.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThird is impressive.\\xa0 Why the interest in the library?\\xa0 Are you working on a project?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m starting to think about it.\\xa0 I have to do a project next year, I don\\u2019t have a lot of free time, and I keep hearing that the subject of my project opens and closes doors, and that goes double for me, because I don\\u2019t have a lot of time to study.\\xa0 If I pick something, I\\u2019ll have to do research on it on my own, and then the year after-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll want to focus on things you have some grounding in, things you researched.\\xa0 I ran into the same thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnd goal?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere are you hoping you end up?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProfessor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The young man barked out a short laugh.\\xa0 I could see Lillian deflate a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI remember when I was aiming for a black coat,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cGave up on that pretty damn fast.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Lillian said, rather less enthused than she had been a moment before.</p>\\n<p>I paid more attention to the scene.\\xa0 Lillian\\u2019s reaction to the man, her body language, the way she was almost wringing her hands, while sitting up straight.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d thought highly of him, for a very short encounter, an older boy at or nearing the end of his adolescent years, clean-faced, clever, gregarious, and he\\u2019d very casually slapped down her dream.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s hard, even without the politics, the fact you need some luck, you have to innovate, break new ground in a way that turns heads.\\xa0 Take it from someone who took some first steps on that path, it tears you up and grinds you down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, I suppose.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t-\\u201d Lillian started.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir,\\u201d I cut in.\\xa0 In doing, I interrupted Mary\\u2019s conversation with another soldier, and made Hubris\\u2019 head rise.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re forgetting something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d the young man asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s a Lamb.\\xa0 She\\u2019s very good at what she does.\\xa0 She already has discussions with doctors and professors on a regular basis.\\xa0 She\\u2019s at or near the top of her classes, and she\\u2019s doing it while we drag her away from classes and into one bad situation after another and ask her to patch us up after the fact.\\xa0 Becoming a professor is hard, I don\\u2019t blame you for crying uncle, <em>sir</em>-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw him bristle at that.</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cBut she won\\u2019t give up.\\xa0 Not like that.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t see it.\\xa0 Nobody who\\u2019s worked with her sees that happening.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAgreed,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The young man in uniform threw up his hands, \\u201cWasn\\u2019t saying anything of the sort.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, is that so?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t break eye contact, boring into his eyes with mine.\\xa0 \\u201cI must\\u2019ve misunderstood you.\\xa0 I beg your pardon, <em>sir</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d put him on the spot, more than a few eyes were on him, they saw the little dominance game, and they were anticipating his response.\\xa0 He was a nice guy, probably, but one who carried weight on his shoulders, his own past failures coloring his perception of things.\\xa0 He likely believed that becoming professor was a fool\\u2019s journey, his intent had likely been pure in saying something to steer Lillian off that path.\\xa0 It might even have been done with a friendly mindset, in the same way one might counsel a young friend against getting a permanent set of horns grafted onto their forehead at a back-alley doctor\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>But who the fuck needed \\u2018friends\\u2019 who tore them down rather than building them up, good intentions or no?</p>\\n<p>He was frowning at me, not breaking eye contact.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d challenged him.\\xa0 Now he couldn\\u2019t \\u2018win\\u2019 here without a crisp retort or getting indignant.\\xa0 I could play off either.\\xa0 Backing down would be a loss, in a sense.</p>\\n<p>His eye flickered to a point behind me.\\xa0 He smiled, and it was a sly, smug smile, \\u201cNothing of concern.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ah, his superior officer was watching.\\xa0 The slyness and smugness hadn\\u2019t been directed my way.\\xa0 He was a man who didn\\u2019t respect the man in charge.</p>\\n<p>The best thing he\\u2019d get to a draw.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMoving!\\u201d the superior officer in charge of the Wagon called out.</p>\\n<p>Soldiers who had stepped off the rails at the side stepped back on.\\xa0 I reached for and grabbed a strap with a fatigued hand.</p>\\n<p>When I glanced Lillian\\u2019s way, she gave me a small smile, before turning back to Mary to resume their conversation.</p>\\n<p>That conversation was cut short.\\xa0 The officer in charge of the wagon spoke, his voice traveling back to us.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re attacking us on a schedule.\\xa0 Tonight\\u2019s attack was worse than the prior two.\\xa0 Men and women with combat stimulants, some with scarred faces and hands, some as quick and stealthy as anyone they\\u2019ve ever seen, might have been more stimulants.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I glanced at the others, gesturing.</p>\\n<p><em>Don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 Plague men.\\xa0 Ghosts.</em></p>\\n<p>The Plague Men and Ghosts were supposed to be on opposing sides.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAfter the second night, the people in charge recognized it as a distraction.\\xa0 They divided forces tonight, trying to root out whatever it was they\\u2019re trying to distract us from.\\xa0 We didn\\u2019t have enough people in place, that stealthy group slipped past us, did a lot of damage, as you can see.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned my eyes upward, looking past the roofs of nearby buildings to the blazing Academy structure.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExpectation is that they found out when the first superweapons showed up, and that\\u2019s when they started with the distractions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho\\u2019s here, sir?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDog, Catcher, Wry Man, Petey, and the Engineer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome of the weird ones,\\u201d Mary observed under her breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t recognize all of those,\\u201d I commented.\\xa0 \\u201cPetey?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s our age,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cKind of?\\xa0 If you-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The officer at the front cut Gordon off.\\xa0 Possibly intentional, a dominance display.\\xa0 Well, it had been rude to start a conversation when he\\u2019d been midway through talking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll want to talk to the people in charge about where you\\u2019ll be setting up, and about calling for help if you need it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The man nodded without looking back our way, and then fell silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf they\\u2019re reacting this violently to the presence of Academy weapons in Brechwell, there might not be a need to hold back.\\xa0 We could call for help now,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBy the time it arrives, things could be underway.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t want to scare them off or tip our hand,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d rather resolve this or make significant headway before <em>anyone</em> arrives.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re still wanting to rush,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy don\\u2019t we at least talk to the other weapons before we make any decisions?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how touchy they are-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome are touchy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe three we haven\\u2019t met are loners, they work alone, for smaller Academies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen let\\u2019s not offend them.\\xa0 We include them in discussions,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAgreed,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>We passed beneath a quadruple-set of portcullis gates, entering into the most open area of the city yet.\\xa0 The sprawl of the local Academy and plenty of open fields for military drills.</p>\\n<p><em>Promising weapons from other Academies are trained alongside their handlers to work alongside squads and armies, here.\\xa0 Academy students with great minds for strategy and military cadets with a good mind for learning the particulars of Academy science are brought here to learn to become officers.</em></p>\\n<p>Or were, with emphasis on the past tense.</p>\\n<p>The fire was bad.\\xa0 Buildings that should have weathered the blaze were sagging.\\xa0 Stitched brought canisters of water, and Academy soldiers connected hoses and manually pumped levers to force it out.\\xa0 They might as well have been throwing thimblefuls of water on a campfire.</p>\\n<p>Yet they kept at it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>The man at the front twisted around.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been here before?\\xa0 You\\u2019re familiar with the area?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have and I am, why?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMost Academies have a last-ditch superweapon.\\xa0 Are you familiar with Brechwell\\u2019s?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Brechwell Beast.\\xa0 Last report I heard said it was awake but sedated, ready to go with a few minutes of notice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon whistled a little under his breath.</p>\\n<p>But I didn\\u2019t care about the Beast, here.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been more interested in his prior answer, his familiarity with the area.</p>\\n<p>I was getting a sense of how things worked here.\\xa0 People new to the area would adopt that particular way of doing things, picking up on both the good and bad habits.</p>\\n<p>Thing was, I was seeing a lot of bad behaviors.\\xa0 The way the soldiers had reacted to the superior officers, hesitating before bringing something to their attention, the fact that the officer hadn\\u2019t filled his men in on who we were, it spoke to a general lack of communication between tiers.</p>\\n<p>There was a flaw here, one I suspected our enemy was smart enough to exploit.\\xa0 There were the guys on the bottom, and there were the people on top, and the ties between the two didn\\u2019t feel particularly strong.</p>\\n<p>Some damn idiotic things could happen when that was the case.\\xa0 Like good soldiers and good water being wasted on a task, because the people at the top were insisting the fires be put out, and didn\\u2019t care that it was an impossible task.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir?\\xa0 One more question.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could tell he was irritated at this point, but he turned and gave me his attention.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m just guessing here, but is the person in charge of Brechwell an utter <em>prat</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon dropped his face to one hand, shaking his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeg pardon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs he a ponce?\\xa0 A dimwit?\\xa0 Does he not know what he\\u2019s doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t dignify that question with an answer, and I\\u2019ll thank you to watch what you ask me in the future,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>He turned around.</p>\\n<p>I turned my attention to the soldiers that stood on either side of the wagon.</p>\\n<p>One or two were smirking a little.</p>\\n<p>I mouthed words.\\xa0 <em>Is he?</em></p>\\n<p>I could make out the movement of their lips in their silent responses, and even if I couldn\\u2019t lipread, I could use guesswork to figure it out.\\xa0 <em>Massive prat</em>.</p>\\n<p>The moment the wagon slowed, I was hopping down, dragging my luggage down after me.\\xa0 It clacked hard against the road top.\\xa0 The others followed suit.\\xa0 Gordon gave a hand to Hubris, the dog using the outstretched arm as a step partway to the ground, then offered a hand to Mary.</p>\\n<p>She beamed at him as she hopped down beside him, her hair and skirt flouncing with the landing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomeone our age, I\\u2019m so excited!\\u201d Helen squealed, as she caught up to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEase up on the pitch a little,\\u201d I said, wincing.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, Hubris and Mary led the way, diverging from the path of the wagon, which was moving toward the fire.\\xa0 I found myself walking between Lillian and Helen.\\xa0 Lillian was quiet.\\xa0 Helen wasn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe could have been a Lamb!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think so,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI almost want to ask you guys to give me the answer,\\u201d I said, \\u201cBut at this point, I\\u2019m happy to see for myself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m glad to have one over on you for once,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo you wouldn\\u2019t tell even if I asked?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled a little, hemmed and hawed, and then said, \\u201cAfter what you said back there, maybe I would.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe, huh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m worried you were trying to get my guard down so you can pull something on me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I snorted.\\xa0 \\u201cUlterior motives?\\xa0 Me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were bothering the captain at the front of the wagon,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p><em>Someone\\u2019s paying attention</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrying to wrap my head around Brechwell,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo tell,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He\\u2019d been listening in, his conversation with Mary trailing off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a military academy.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not a place that makes big advancements.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re in charge of the Academy and you\\u2019re ambitious, and I\\u2019m working under the assumption people <em>are</em>, then Brechwell isn\\u2019t going to really open doors.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a stopping point.\\xa0 A place people come midway through their careers.\\xa0 Have promise?\\xa0 Study here a few years, pick up essentials, move on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPeople in charge are either here for punishment, they\\u2019re ambitious but frustrated, they don\\u2019t realize how bad their situation is because they\\u2019re <em>that</em> dumb, or they\\u2019re willing to try and play a subtler game, where they find pet projects and nurture those projects, and then try to claim credit for the successes that follow.\\xa0 None of those things breed good leadership.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not sensing good leadership here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich is why you asked the question,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I gave her a nod of confirmation.\\xa0 \\u201cFeeling them out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIdentifying the problem is good, but there\\u2019s more to it,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need solutions,\\u201d I agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cWith a gap between the leadership and the people on the ground, maybe we insert ourselves in as middlemen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWorth watching out for.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>I realized why Gordon and Mary were walking in this particular direction.\\xa0 There was a smaller fire burning, and three corpses were draped around the body.\\xa0 Two odd figures were standing by the fire, and I realized that they were our fellow weapons.\\xa0 The people we\\u2019d be working with for this particular mission, at least until help came.</p>\\n<p><em>Dog and Catcher not present, one missing\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>The woman was middle-aged, and she looked frumpy.\\xa0 Her hair was well looked after and her clothes were nice enough, but neither looked like a good match to her body type or particular appearance.\\xa0 She wore a jacket with a pattern on it, left open to show a heavy apron, more like something a blacksmith might wear, only accentuating a protruding belly on an otherwise narrow frame.\\xa0 Her boots were clunkers.\\xa0 Her hair was short, and she didn\\u2019t wear enough makeup to tie it together.\\xa0 A bit of blue eye shadow might have worked.</p>\\n<p>The old man was, I knew at a glance, the Wry Man.\\xa0 His hair was gray, his skin wrinkled in a way that carved deep into his face, and his bushy eyebrows went with a perpetual grin.\\xa0 He was stooped, much of his weight leaning on a cane.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lambs, I take it?\\u201d the Wry Man asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNice to meet you,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The Wry Man didn\\u2019t reply to that.\\xa0 Instead, he lifted his cane, prodding one of the corpses.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLambs, meet our opposition.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned my attention to the bodies.</p>\\n<p>One was a Ghost, I could tell from the damage to her body, the way the fine bones riddled her flesh, criss-crossing within her injuries, as if she\\u2019d been filled with bone-white needles.</p>\\n<p>The other was a man, but not one of the plague men.\\xa0 He lay there, and he looked alive, skin flushed a bruised purple, veins standing out against his skin.\\xa0 His fists were clenched, body contorted, and his mouth yawned open.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t look at his face without imagining him mid-scream.</p>\\n<p>The third corpse wasn\\u2019t human, not at first glance.\\xa0 Augmentations.\\xa0 Hunched, skin textured, eyes wide and bloodshot, its hands were twice the usual size and claw-tipped.\\xa0 The skin wasn\\u2019t uniformly colored, but instead bruised in patches that seemed to accent the deeper parts of the body- the hollow of collarbone and throat, the lines of the jaw, and the eye sockets.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re mixing it up,\\u201d Gordon observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot one of them feels safe,\\u201d the woman said, her voice pitched in a funny way, as if she was putting on a voice for a puppet show.\\xa0 \\u201cThey brought bodyguards, and they\\u2019ve been convinced to send those bodyguards out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian knelt by the body of the man who was covered in veins.\\xa0 She had to dig in fingernails to pry his eyelids apart.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre these two people under the same drug, at different stages?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s what the docs are saying,\\u201d the Wry Man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re modifying them on a core level,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cRewriting them.\\xa0 It\\u2019s incredibly painful, not to mention dangerous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo I hear,\\u201d the Wry Man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould have to be a bacteria, dumping a load of new information into the bodies, rewrite the pattern of their makeup in patches.\\xa0 Looking at that one\\u2026 they\\u2019re under the effect of powerful stimulants while it happens.\\xa0 Do it a few times in a row-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGet monsters,\\u201d I finished.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s what they want, but there\\u2019s a reason we don\\u2019t use this,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt tends to kill people as often as it gives you monsters, when you\\u2019re making changes this drastic.\\xa0 That\\u2019s in Academy labs, under strict supervision.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey aren\\u2019t holding back,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He looked up, \\u201cWhere are the other weapons?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour buddies Dog and Catcher are on the prowl, seeing if they can\\u2019t trace them back to where they came from.\\xa0 The Engineer is with them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>The Engineer?</em></p>\\n<p>I glanced at the woman.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t the Engineer then.\\xa0 By process of elimination-</p>\\n<p>She smiled down at me.\\xa0 I averted my eyes, somehow uncomfortable.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ve attacked at sundown every night.\\xa0 Either hitting us here, or going after civilians,\\u201d the Wry Man said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we\\u2019re going to get them, we need to do it tonight, or we\\u2019re going to have to wait until tomorrow night.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCrumbs,\\u201d I muttered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWilling to leave those bags behind?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>Gordon glanced at me and the others.\\xa0 We nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen let\\u2019s go join the others for the night\\u2019s hunt,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 I saw how crooked his teeth were as he bared them.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can get acquainted on the way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/11/14/tooth-and-nail-7-10/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Armed men led me out of the building, with Warren joining them.\\xa0 We made our way across the more open street, until we were just beyond the point where I\\u2019d been made to kneel, a coat over my head.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs were there, in the shadows, smoke and the rain, the group spaced evenly apart.\\xa0 I saw them before my escorts did.\\xa0 The men started, reaching for guns, and it was Warren who stopped them.</p>\\n<p>Gordon stepped forward.</p>\\n<p>He was hiding it, but I could see the smouldering anger in his eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEverything good?\\u201d his voice didn\\u2019t have a trace of that anger.</p>\\n<p>A nice vague question, conveying teamwork, expectations, while giving nothing away.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was a good guy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s good,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He nodded before turning his back.\\xa0 I followed him back into shadows, leaving the men and Warren behind.</p>\\n<p>Mary, Gordon, Helen, and Hubris knew what was up, and they moved easily from areas of shadow to areas of deeper shadow, or to places where there was more smoke and cover.\\xa0 The art of disappearing, honed over a long time, for the humans.\\xa0 For Hubris, I imagined it was training.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t positive that dog had the <em>brain</em> of a dog.</p>\\n<p>Lillian, though, was just walking away.\\xa0 I could imagine how the onlookers could see her, and I was <em>pretty</em> sure she wasn\\u2019t disappearing properly.</p>\\n<p>I reached out to grab her sleeve, and tugged her into deeper shadows.</p>\\n<p>We made our way to the nearest tower, then climbed to the roof.</p>\\n<p>The Brechwell Beast was just close enough to give some cause for worry, but not so close that I was worried about my footing on the roof.</p>\\n<p>I was one of the last ones up.\\xa0 I knew what to expect when I reached the top.</p>\\n<p>Glares, folded arms, <em>concern</em>.</p>\\n<p>I got out of Lillian\\u2019s way as she got off the ladder, and being mid-step on more precarious footing, I wasn\\u2019t in a position to dodge as she slapped my arm hard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did you get?\\u201d Gordon asked, quiet.\\xa0 The anger hadn\\u2019t really subsided, and he was still talking in that cool, collected way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not going to get on my ass, sock me in the face, or anything like that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAt this point I\\u2019m suspicious you enjoy the reactions,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 The mission.\\xa0 What were you going for, and what did you get?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause if you didn\\u2019t actually have an objective,\\u201d he said, pausing as the Brechwell Beast struck a wall, \\u201cI <em>am</em> going to be upset.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wanted to know what they were doing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cBring the Academy\\u2019s knowledge to the masses.\\xa0 Bring the war to a close with a few final, major events, distracting us from the distribution of very easy to understand texts.\\xa0 Hurts the Academy in terms of the power gap in what they\\u2019re making, in terms of control, in economics, makes for more competition over the resources the Academy wants.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 We have classes on ethics, procedure,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Really?</em>\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes!\\xa0 Of course!\\xa0 So much would go wrong so fast, if you just started handing out these books and basic starter kits like the ones they sell to young Academy students.\\xa0 It would be <em>horrible, </em>Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause my gut instinct was to maybe not fight as hard as we might otherwise fight, when it comes to this.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not sure, but Fray might be willing to negotiate a trade, here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA <em>trade</em>?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA few key players from their side, in exchange for letting this thing happen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFuck,\\u201d Gordon said, under his breath.</p>\\n<p>My eyebrows went up.\\xa0 Harsher language than his usual.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe lost Jamie,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot in the final sense-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Yes</em> in the final sense,\\u201d I said, my voice low.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever.\\xa0 However you look at it.\\xa0 I\\u2019m bringing it up even though we\\u2019ve been dancing around the topic for months because I don\\u2019t want to lose <em>you</em>, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou won\\u2019t.\\xa0 I knew exactly what I was doing.\\xa0 I know how Fray thinks, I know how to dance on this razor\\u2019s edge.\\xa0 I\\u2019m <em>here</em>, aren\\u2019t I?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re here and you\\u2019re talking about entertaining her ideas.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t keep meeting his eyes, so I turned away, only to find myself looking at Lillian.\\xa0 I ran my fingers through my hair, fixing it, as I paced a little.</p>\\n<p>I came face to face with Mary and stopped in my tracks.</p>\\n<p><em>I talked to Percy</em>, I thought.\\xa0 But I couldn\\u2019t say it without it coming across as manipulative.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing, Sy?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>I turned away from Mary to look at him.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been acting different all night.\\xa0 Changing your pattern, increasing the tempo and intensity, making calls and now you\\u2019re working against us like you\\u2019re trying to keep <em>us</em> off guard?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not what I\\u2019m trying to do.\\xa0 But I knew you\\u2019d try to stop me-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor good reason!\\u201d Mary said, startling me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m here!\\u201d\\xa0 I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI walked in, I walked out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWithout the bag?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWithout the bag with Jamie\\u2019s books in it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh.\\xa0 Gosh,\\u201d Lillian said, under her breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re going back tomorrow,\\u201d I said, annoyed.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to walk out then too.\\xa0 With Jamie- \\u2018s books.\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 We walk away with an idea of what Fray is doing, with an idea of how to counter it or steer it in the right directions.\\xa0 Mary gets to look Percy in the eye, we confront Fray, and with her preoccupied like she is, trying to juggle two factions and a half-dozen plans, we\\u2019ll have her at a disadvantage.\\xa0 It will be the one and only time, maybe, that we ever have that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at each of the Lambs.\\xa0 I even looked at Gordon\\u2019s dang dog, in hopes of seeing a glimmer of understanding.</p>\\n<p>Gordon approached me.\\xa0 I could see the anger in his eyes, the frustration.\\xa0 I steeled myself.</p>\\n<p><em>Pretty much expected this since I\\u2019d realized I could walk inside those doors down there.</em></p>\\n<p>But Gordon didn\\u2019t hit me.</p>\\n<p>When his arms wrapped around me, I wondered if he was intending to simply toss me over the edge of the roof.\\xa0 The size difference, the strength difference, my chronic low weight, I was willing to bet he could.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you <em>doing,</em> Sy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary stepped closer, putting a hand on Gordon\\u2019s back, her expression unreadable.\\xa0 Lillian hung back, both hands on her satchel with the medical equipment inside.\\xa0 Helen was perched on the peak of the roof, slightly above us, staring, more old Helen than new Helen, just for now.</p>\\n<p>Seeing them, I was choked up in a way that made me feel like I was in the midst of drowning.\\xa0 I wanted to get out of the hug, to have space, to have a chance to explain, and it didn\\u2019t feel like they were giving it to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m trying to say it right.\\xa0 The thing with distributing the books, it\\u2019s the second phase of a greater plan.\\xa0 She\\u2019s got another plan.\\xa0 I think, and maybe Lillian can say if I\\u2019m on the right track or not\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I reached out for help.\\xa0 Lillian didn\\u2019t give any indication she was going to play ball.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026the work that comes out of the books.\\xa0 Could it have a signature?\\xa0 Give everyone the tools to make stitched, to create life, to create the right drugs, grow Warbeasts, I don\\u2019t even know, but in a way that sets them apart from the Academy.\\xa0 Then, when she makes her next move, it\\u2019ll be <em>easier</em> to frame the Academy for it, like she did with the sterilization and the chemical leash, because that precedent exists.\\xa0 She can establish a narrative, at a time when the Academy has less credibility, when it\\u2019s damned itself by trying and failing to control the spread of this information.\\xa0 That the Academy is worse than it is.\\xa0 The next war comes around, the rebellion is better armed, the Academy is hurting.\\xa0 Step four drives a wedge into the cracks that become apparent.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not saying this is it, but it\\u2019s- don\\u2019t you see the scale we\\u2019re operating at, here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>His tone suggested he wasn\\u2019t listening to me at all.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet go of me!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I fought my way free of his arms. \\xa0 I backed away a few paces. \\xa0 \\u201cListen to me!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hear you,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe all do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m <em>right</em>.\\xa0 This is what I do, this is what I\\u2019m <em>for</em>.\\xa0 I can figure a way forward, find what we need to do to exploit and derail her plan, and this war will be over, no more mice will have to get thrown into vats to make ghosts, people won\\u2019t end up conscripted by the Crown and find themselves facing down a cousin of theirs in a gunfight!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut that\\u2019s not what we\\u2019re talking about.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s the mission!\\xa0 It\\u2019s what we\\u2019re <em>made</em> to do.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been explaining for something like three or four minutes and we\\u2019re not talking about it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 We\\u2019re not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause I seem to recall the last time we met Fray, <em>you</em> were thinking about defecting,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou were <em>close,</em> too.\\xa0 If a single snowflake had fallen on your back, it might have been the push you needed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The words hung in the air.</p>\\n<p>Gordon didn\\u2019t flinch.\\xa0 The reaction wasn\\u2019t even all that profound with the other Lambs.\\xa0 A turn of one or two heads, looking at our tallest, strongest member.\\xa0 Curious looks, but it was almost as if they were wondering what his reaction was, more than they were wondering if it was true.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not even talking about going that far,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI hear you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen what\\u2019s the problem!?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe problem,\\u201d he said, and his voice was quiet, \\u201cIs that I\\u2019m worried you\\u2019re falling apart even more than I am, and I have <em>seams</em>, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m here,\\u201d I said, my voice low.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been in top form tonight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been in <em>a</em> form, Sy,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m just not sure it\\u2019s yours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could have hit him, if I didn\\u2019t know it would be futile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you <em>want,</em> Gordon?\\xa0 You\\u2019re getting on my case, you\\u2019re making me play this dang-blasted guessing game, like I\\u2019m supposed to unravel a riddle that isn\\u2019t even a riddle.\\xa0 Tell me what you want me to say or do, and I\\u2019ll say or do it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust tell me, Sy.\\xa0 What are you <em>doing</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrying to do the mission?\\xa0 Trying to figure out how to beat a woman that\\u2019s smarter and on better footing than I am?\\xa0 Apparently without the help of my <em>team?\\u201d</em></p>\\n<p>There was no response.\\xa0 Mary kept one hand at Gordon\\u2019s arm, barely inches separating them.\\xa0 His dog stood on the other side of him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cForget the mission.\\xa0 You want me to bare my emotions?\\xa0 I\\u2019m trying to figure out how things work with the group being a different shape, one man down, one dog up, and two more members on the way.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been worrying ever since the <em>last</em> time we saw Fray that the group might splinter.\\xa0 Thanks to <em>you</em>, by the way.\\xa0 You did start that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that the answer you\\u2019re looking for?\\xa0 I\\u2019m trying to hold things together, that\\u2019s all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think we\\u2019ll both know the answer when you give it.\\xa0 But that doesn\\u2019t seem like you\\u2019re answering the question.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I might have screamed in his face, if I didn\\u2019t think it would cause problems.</p>\\n<p>The Brechwell Beast was tearing at another set of houses a short distance away.\\xa0 Widening the gap made by some of Fray\\u2019s explosions, it looked like.</p>\\n<p>I wondered if any people were dying in the process.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I snapped my head around.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen you went down there, were you running <em>to</em>, or were you running away?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t do this, Mary.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t throw cryptic questions at me and expect answers I don\\u2019t have.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause the rush, the recklessness, the fact you\\u2019re so adamant about wanting to get this done before the new member arrives\\u2026 before <em>Jamie</em> arrives-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not Jamie,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-it seems like you\\u2019re running away.\\xa0 And now you\\u2019re talking about working with Fray?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot working <em>with</em>, just not working <em>against</em> as hard as we might.\\xa0 Everything we\\u2019ve done to this point, what has it been <em>for</em>?\\xa0 Does Fray <em>really</em> hurt the future of the Lambs and the betterment of mankind?\\xa0 Are we really going to sit here and pretend we <em>like</em> the Academy, the Duke is an all-around stand up guy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think you\\u2019re evading.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI evade.\\xa0 You might as well accuse Helen of acting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon spoke up, \\u201cI just want a satisfactory answer to the question.\\xa0 You, <em>someone</em>, just convince me that you\\u2019re not losing it, and I\\u2019m open to further discussion, whatever you guys want to do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat am I <em>doing?</em>\\u201d I asked him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I threw my arms up, and I started walking away.</p>\\n<p>My body felt oddly light, and it wasn\\u2019t because of the exercise or the fact we hadn\\u2019t really eaten since early evening on the train.\\xa0 The bag of books wasn\\u2019t on my back anymore, and the absence made me feel weird, eerily disconnected from the ground at my feet.</p>\\n<p><em>Jamie</em> wasn\\u2019t at my back.</p>\\n<p>The others were following me, I knew.\\xa0 I could have bolted.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary would have caught me.</p>\\n<p>I ran my fingers through my hair again, then jammed them into pockets that had only just started to dry out while we were indoors.\\xa0 Late in the evening, late spring, soaked through, I felt cold to the bone.</p>\\n<p>I wheeled around.\\xa0 The others stopped in their tracks, but for Lillian.</p>\\n<p>I waited patiently as she made her way across to me, carefully striding so one foot was on each side of the gently peaked roof.\\xa0 She pulled off her coat and extended it to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a <em>girl</em>,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s unisex, Sy.\\xa0 Nobody\\u2019s going to poke fun.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My finger touched the ring at my thumb.\\xa0 \\u201cI meant you\\u2019re a girl, so it wouldn\\u2019t be right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll live, Sy.\\xa0 Just hold my hand so I don\\u2019t fall off this roof, okay?\\xa0 And so I know you won\\u2019t run off?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I was too tired to fight.\\xa0 The last few minutes of conversation had sapped all the fight from me, and I wasn\\u2019t sure I had it in me to even try for flight, either.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were going to say something,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen you stopped there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\xa0 Forgot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat were you going to say?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat if I don\\u2019t have an answer for you, Gordon?\\xa0 What if there\\u2019s no magic answer that makes sense of what I\\u2019m doing in a way that satisfies you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cWell?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know, Sy.\\xa0 We adapt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>We adapt</em>.\\xa0 He said it in a way that made it sound like we were talking about his body failing on him.\\xa0 A inevitable, growing disability.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGimpy boy and his dog and Sylvester end up on the bench, while the new Lambs look after the next few missions?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd then someone else ends up benched, a new Lamb comes out of the Academy and replaces <em>them</em>, and so it goes, until we\\u2019re all reminiscing about the old days?\\xa0 Doing the same tests we did back in day one, testing our cognitive ability as it slips away or our bodies fail?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI remember those days,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe days we first met, the tests.\\xa0 I hated those things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI found ways to make it interesting,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know.\\xa0 You did.\\xa0 I realized what you were doing after a bit, and then tried to mess you up, or throw a wrench into the works.\\xa0 Then you made it harder to figure out what sort of games you were playing while we were playing other games, and so it went.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that what you\\u2019re afraid of?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cBeing benched?\\xa0 Being replaced?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s\\u2026 not at all it, no offense.\\xa0 That\\u2019s the human condition.\\xa0 Parent replaced by child, except we won\\u2019t ever be parents, so this is a different sort of legacy.\\xa0 The only thing I\\u2019m afraid of is losing <em>you.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at the other Lambs.\\xa0 \\u201cAny of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Brechwell Beast roared, not so far away.\\xa0 I watched and listened for a second.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSucks,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian squeezed my hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlways thought it would be you guys falling to pieces and I\\u2019d be putting my brilliant mind to task with figuring you out and how to handle it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cGoes to show how good I am, if Gordon\\u2019s right and there\\u2019s some riddle to my behavior I can\\u2019t answer.\\xa0 Can\\u2019t even understand myself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I\\u2019m wrong,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cIf there\\u2019s no complicated riddle to unravel, then that\\u2019s worse.\\xa0 Because you can\\u2019t keep going like this.\\xa0 You can only dance on a razor\\u2019s edge for so long.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cComplicated?\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s complicated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>All heads turned to Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh, clarify?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot complicated,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s very simple, I think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, clarify about what \\u2018it\\u2019 is,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy is <em>acting</em>,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s playing at being Jamie, and he\\u2019s doing a really bad job of it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou might be getting confused,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe longer hair, carrying his books around, it\\u2019s not an <em>act</em>, it\\u2019s a homage.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 A way of keeping him around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s an <em>act</em>,\\u201d Helen said, firm.\\xa0 \\u201cA bad act, because you don\\u2019t have the right tools.\\xa0 You said you didn\\u2019t want to see the Lambs die.\\xa0 The only thing any of us can do is hold someone in our hearts.\\xa0 There\\u2019s an emptiness when they go, and we fill in that emptiness with memories.\\xa0 Or drink, or work, or violence, sometimes, but mostly with memories.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoetic,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhere did you hear that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been studying!\\xa0 Ibott says it\\u2019s useful for when I\\u2019m older and I have to lure in men,\\u201d Helen said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cBut it\\u2019s true!\\xa0 Sy is filling his heart with memories and he has a crummy memory.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a little more complicated than that,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes!\\xa0 It is!\\u201d\\xa0 Helen drew closer.\\xa0 \\u201cSylvester is trying to fill the empty space in the <em>group\\u2019s </em>heart, too.\\xa0 He\\u2019s doing what he was made to do.\\xa0 He\\u2019s trying to cover for the things that Jamie used to do.\\xa0 The map, drawn on his shirt, that\\u2019s Sy being Sy to give us something that Jamie would have known like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Snap of her fingers for punctuation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd walking into Fray\\u2019s meeting?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie would have known who the people are and he would have had ideas about what they were doing.\\xa0 He could have drawn connections.\\xa0 But Sy knows that if he just walks in and introduces himself, <em>he</em> will get an idea of who people are and what they\\u2019re doing.\\xa0 He can draw connections.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The others turned their eyes to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt sounds awkward because it <em>is</em>,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie is probably the worst one of us to try and make up stopgap cover-ups for.\\xa0 What Sy is trying to do, all the other stuff, like letting the Brechwell Beast out, he\\u2019s trying to get control.\\xa0 Because he\\u2019s insecure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian squeezed my hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cControl through chaos?\\u201d Gordon asked, still staring at me.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah, that sounds right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not about insecurity, thank you very much,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about how to cover the gap that Jamie left.\\xa0 How to keep things working smoothly, so the group stays effective.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re doing it,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cIn a weird way, but you\\u2019re doing it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>More than I realized?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe first part, anyway,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I sighed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJam- the replacement might be coming tomorrow,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis thing with Fray, is it you wanting that control?\\xa0 Impact the world, even secondhand, let them know \\u2018we\\u2019re still here\\u2019, \\u2018we still matter\\u2019?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Even without Jamie?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019ll have to happen before he shows,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we decide to do it.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll need to discuss this <em>thoroughly</em>.\\xa0 Come to a consensus.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen we-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn the morning, Sy,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe come up with a game plan in the morning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We turned and started moving as a group.\\xa0 There were soldiers and weapons gathering on some rooftops nearby.\\xa0 They were surrounding the perimeter of Fray\\u2019s building.\\xa0 Some of them had equipment to hook them to the rooftops, with long guns that were screwed into the roofs.</p>\\n<p>Dog and Catcher were waiting not too far away, with a Wry Man who was slightly hunched over.\\xa0 The Wry Man was flushed, veins sticking out of his face, and jerked in reaction to the movement of me withdrawing a hand from a clammy pocket.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStatus?\\u201d Catcher asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo update,\\u201d I said, leaving out any mention of my visit with Fray.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re not budging.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re talking about mounting an attack.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head, \\u201cNo.\\xa0 She\\u2019s got a maneuver she\\u2019s going to pull.\\xa0 Moment we try, half our soldiers turn on the other half.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think she plans to leave at all.\\xa0 Her soldiers in the towers are going to subtly guide the Beast away from her for the meantime, and they\\u2019ll be part of the uprising if and when she makes a move.\\xa0 When the dust clears, she\\u2019s the one in charge of Brechwell.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow sure are you?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMostly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded.\\xa0 He stared off into the distance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t attack, then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBad idea,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do we do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait.\\xa0 Bide our time.\\xa0 Gives more opportunities for the soldiers in towers to make mistakes.\\xa0 In daylight, the Beast won\\u2019t be guided by any lights from the towers.\\xa0 With a lucky roll of the dice, he might head in that direction.\\xa0 Without that lucky roll, the Lambs will make a move.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Catcher nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look tired,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cGo sleep.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been at this for longer than we have, you were here when we arrived,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is what we do.\\xa0 We\\u2019re watchdogs,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou rest so you can do what <em>you</em> do.\\xa0 Tomorrow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>\\u2619</b></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I was pacing in the bedroom when the door cracked open.\\xa0 I stopped in my tracks.</p>\\n<p

bed.\\xa0 She shoved me down onto it.\\xa0 \\u201cStay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cStaying,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd don\\u2019t look,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI didn\\u2019t want to come here in a nightgown with all of the soldiers standing guard between here and the other building.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s my room,\\u201d I said, pointedly turning my head to look at her.\\xa0 \\u201cWho are you to make rules about looking or not looking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She didn\\u2019t have a reply to that, but her face flushed pink.\\xa0 She began unbuttoning her top.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When things reached the point where I might have seen something, I simply muttered, \\u201cWhatever,\\u201d and looked away.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t a competition,\\u201d she told me.\\xa0 \\u201cShe encouraged me to come.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSure, in the interest of playing fair,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat\\u2019s not- stop that!\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cFine,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMary sleeps nude most of the time she sleeps over, you know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian froze.\\xa0 I could see in my peripheral vision, and turned my head slowly to look her way.\\xa0 She was holding the nightgown up in a way that protected her modesty, yet to pull it on.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>If it\\u2019s not a competition on any level, that shouldn\\u2019t matter</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>But it is, so you\\u2019re considering your options</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cJust kidding,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re the worst.\\xa0 You really are.\\xa0 Look away.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I did.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian finished pulling the nightgown on.\\xa0 I climbed under covers and scooted over.\\xa0 She climbed in next to me.\\xa0 Where Mary had found a natural configuration beside me, often with her back pressed to me, Lillian curled into me.\\xa0 She positioned herself lower down, head on my shoulder and chest, arm reaching across my torso, one leg draped over my legs.\\xa0 The fabric of the nightgown at her knees got in the way, so she hiked it up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It took her a few seconds to find the exact right position.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary always wear scratchier stuff,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLace and stuff.\\xa0 This is softer.\\xa0 It\\u2019s nice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I plucked at the hem of her nightgown.\\xa0 She swatted it out of my hand and slapped my chest.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGo to sleep,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I lay there, staring at the ceiling.\\xa0 After a few minutes, she raised her head to look at me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat were you even doing?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNormally I\\u2019d be reading,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cbut I don\\u2019t have the books.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She nodded, head rubbing against me.\\xa0 Her breath was warm against my chest.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t it get boring?\\xa0 Reading the books over and over again?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNever.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She nodded again.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI miss him too,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe got along.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe was a good guy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p

didn\\u2019t say anything more.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It took me far too long to realize that there was a damp feeling against my chest, little movements.\\xa0 I shifted position, lifting my head up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Crying.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Pulling my shoulder out from under her, I changed position, so I was facing her.\\xa0 I wiped tears from her cheeks.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCrybaby.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She hit me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCome on,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I pulled her head against my chest, and she burrowed close, clinging tighter.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I stroked her hair, over and over, rhythmically, but I was the one who was lulled into sleep.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Alongside the nights I\\u2019d had Mary stay over, it was the fifth night of sleep I\\u2019d had in two weeks.</p>\\n<p>\\xa0<a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/tooth-and-nail-7-9/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs this a joke?\\u201d Cynthia asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 Her eyes were fixed to mine.\\xa0 \\u201cWarren, would you do us a favor and bring Sylvester a chair?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren approached with a chair.\\xa0 He extended an open palm at the end of the table closer to Percy and Mauer.\\xa0 I shook my head, indicating the middle of the long table, facing Fray, my back to the audience.</p>\\n<p>Part of it was that I didn\\u2019t feel comfortable sitting on one side or the other, for much the reason Fray couldn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Part of it was that I suspected a few of them might casually kill me if I got in arm\\u2019s reach.\\xa0 The final part of it was that I wanted the audience there so I was in front of them, facing the same direction, so that anyone who looked at me had to look at them.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia\\u2019s chair screeched as she stood from her end of the table.\\xa0 Two gloved hands pressed against the surface.</p>\\n<p><em>Case in point</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you going somewhere?\\u201d Fray asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think I\\u2019m done here,\\u201d Cynthia said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe only reason I haven\\u2019t left the room yet is that I\\u2019m trying to gauge if I could get away with slitting his throat,\\u201d Cynthia said, raising her eyes from the table to look at Fray.\\xa0 She smiled in a way that made it clear her skin wasn\\u2019t proper skin.\\xa0 The creases were too ill-defined in places, too forced in others.</p>\\n<p><em>It might become more like ordinary skin in time, </em>I mused.</p>\\n<p>It was reassuring to know that there were options like that available, when the fate of my own skin was up in the air.\\xa0 Warren set the chair down and I took my seat.\\xa0 It was a heavy wooden thing, likely grown into the shape of a chair by use of a mold, and I couldn\\u2019t sit in it easily.\\xa0 Either my legs stuck out directly in front of me, or my back wasn\\u2019t touching the back of the chair, even with my backpack, and I risked slouching.\\xa0 I pulled my feet up onto the seat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have an audience,\\u201d Mauer told Cynthia.\\xa0 \\u201cPeople who matter, who have contributed or want to contribute to what we\\u2019re doing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFuck the audience,\\u201d Cynthia said.</p>\\n<p><em>Angry.\\xa0 </em>Cynthia wasn\\u2019t nearly as composed as she had been the last time we\\u2019d crossed paths.</p>\\n<p>Mauer, however, seemed as cool as ice.\\xa0 He still had the reddish-bronze hair, the weary look in an otherwise young face, blemished only by a sharp nose, but he wore a long sleeved shirt that looked a little worn and faded, suggesting he\\u2019d spent a lot of time outdoors, and he had a long military coat draped over his shoulders, a fair share of it covering his bad hand.\\xa0 The hand was moving at his knee, fidgeting, and I imagined it was a tell, impossible to fully hide.\\xa0 Too much pain and emotion together put it in perpetual motion.</p>\\n<p>Percy sat beside him.\\xa0 I\\u2019d almost forgotten what he looked like, and might have forgotten entirely if it hadn\\u2019t been for the fact that I\\u2019d recently reread some of Jamie\\u2019s writings.\\xa0 He was taller than Mauer, and almost the opposite of Mauer in condition.\\xa0 Where the reverend\\u2019s physical condition was almost identical to what it had been, his clothes more worn, Percy\\u2019s clothes were finer than the ones I\\u2019d seen him in before.\\xa0 I could imagine an aristocrat wearing his outfit, but for the long coat that was so reminiscent of a doctor\\u2019s without quite being one.\\xa0 He still favored a style of clothes that accented his narrow frame.\\xa0 <em>Physically</em>, however, his graying hair was longer, he had a mustache now, and his beard needed a touch of a trim.\\xa0 The lines of his face were deeper, and deepened further by anxiety.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo explain where Cynthia is coming from, so our audience doesn\\u2019t believe she or any of the rest of us crazed,\\u201d Mauer said, injecting a small barb into the phrase, \\u201cthe little boy sitting here at the table is not a real child, nor is he human.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour facts are wrong,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m human.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA <em>modified</em> human,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cCalling you precocious would be understating things.\\xa0 The Lambs have come up during discussions on other nights, as some here might recall.\\xa0 This is one of them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Is this how it\\u2019s going to be?\\xa0 Even you\\u2019re going to gang up on me?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cHmph,\\u201d one burly man on Cynthia\\u2019s end of the table grunted.\\xa0 He sized me up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA monster in the Crown\\u2019s employ,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 His voice was carrying to the rest of the room.\\xa0 That hadn\\u2019t changed.\\xa0 \\u201cCynthia\\u2019s reaction isn\\u2019t an unfair one, dramatic as it is.\\xa0 He has a body count, and if I understand it, Cynthia was one of his victims.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlmost,\\u201d Cynthia said.\\xa0 \\u201cVery nearly.\\u201d\\xa0 She had a knife drawn.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t pointed at me, but the end of the knife tapped now and again against the table.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou killed my children,\\u201d Percy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Wasn\\u2019t worth arguing the particulars.\\xa0 \\u201cThat was more the Lambs as a whole than me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA plague of spiders and a spree of murders in Whitney, the systematic execution of independent doctors and researchers, enforcing the will of the Academy and the Crown,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p>His voice was so rich, the nuance on every word perfectly chosen.\\xa0 I broke into a smile despite myself, glad that the audience\\xa0 behind us couldn\\u2019t see my face.\\xa0 \\u201cI seem to recall you putting a gun to the head of a little girl.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>I</em> recall that she was no more a human than you are,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p><em>Point.\\xa0 </em>Couldn\\u2019t argue that one.\\xa0 She <em>wasn\\u2019t</em> more human than I was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m human,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI haven\\u2019t taken any drugs that Genevieve Fray here hasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 I know you want to hammer in the \\u2018inhuman monster\\u2019 idea, and you\\u2019re going to keep saying it over and over until people start believing it, but people are <em>here</em>, they\\u2019re listening, they\\u2019re making choices.\\xa0 They\\u2019re smarter than you\\u2019re pretending they are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs this your plan?\\u201d Cynthia asked, \\u201cInvite yourself to the meeting and subvert us from within with wordplay?\\xa0 Address the audience and turn them against us?\\xa0 Genevieve, you invited him here for this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Before Fray could answer, Percy spoke, \\u201cYou freed Avis with inside help.\\xa0 This wouldn\\u2019t be the help?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I managed to keep my expression flat.</p>\\n<p>Fray shook her head.\\xa0 \\u201cI would be happy if it were, but no.\\xa0 And I think <em>Sylvester</em> should answer Cynthia\\u2019s question.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>As I opened my mouth to respond, she quickly added, \\u201cKeeping in mind that he is what he is, and every statement should be taken with a grain of salt.\\xa0 \\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Et tu, sister?\\xa0 </em>I had to appreciate the word choice of \\u2018what\\u2019 I was versus \\u2018who\\u2019 I was.\\xa0 A subtle choice that I was sure Mauer had noticed and appreciated.</p>\\n<p>I was in an awkward position, because I\\u2019d had so many accusations thrown at me.\\xa0\\xa0 It was an effective tactic in argument, throwing a dozen half-true statements at someone in short order.\\xa0 To answer every last one would have taken five times as long as it took to make the accusation, and left me with no time to argue my point.\\xa0 Even if I did argue against the worst offenders, I couldn\\u2019t change the fact that the first argument in my audience\\u2019s ears was that I was a monster.</p>\\n<p>Worse, my memory wasn\\u2019t quite at the point where I could pick out specific points to argue.</p>\\n<p>And I knew it was Mauer\\u2019s doing.\\xa0 An attack on me, surer than anything Cynthia was doing.\\xa0 He was the more dangerous one, even if she had a knife and the desire to use it.</p>\\n<p>Better to take a different tack.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought you needed a, ah, you\\u2019ll have to remind me here, Mauer,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I snapped my fingers.\\xa0 \\u201cSomething something advocate?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDevil\\u2019s advocate,\\u201d Mauer said.\\xa0 \\u201cPromoter of the Faith.\\xa0 One who argues against.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Cynthia stood straighter.\\xa0 Her knife seized firmly in one hand, an impressive length just shy of being a proper <em>sword</em>, she stalked the length of the table.</p>\\n<p><em>Might have to revise my opinion on how dangerous the woman with the knife is.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia,\\u201d Mauer said, not rushing his words despite the fact she was seconds from stabbing me.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t be barbaric.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw Fray give a small shake of her head, but she wasn\\u2019t looking at me, Mauer, or Cynthia.\\xa0 It was Warren, questioning if he should intervene.</p>\\n<p>Fray wasn\\u2019t on my side as much as I\\u2019d hoped, if she was really saying <em>no</em>.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia reached out, seizing me by the hair.\\xa0 She pulled my head to one side.\\xa0 As the knife came down, I reached up to block it with one hand.\\xa0 It cut against the part of my wrist that was closest to bone, on one side.\\xa0 I could feel the blade against bone, too sharp and clean a slice to properly <em>rasp</em>.</p>\\n<p>Knives were the worst things to deal with in a fight.\\xa0 Guns were awful, a bullet hurt like the dickens, but thanks to the fact that they were meant to kill stitched, they tended to either miss or kill the target.\\xa0 Knives either killed or hospitalized the target.\\xa0 Short of being as trained as Gordon or Mary, there was no happy ending once the knife really came into play, and not always for them.</p>\\n<p>Worse, I was falling back into old habits.\\xa0 My mind was split three ways, caught between thinking of something to say that would make her hesitate, something that would bring another person to my aid, and how to actually defend myself.</p>\\n<p>She pulled her hand back, then stabbed for my throat.\\xa0 I twisted in my seat, moving as far away from the knife as I could-</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Cynthia,</em>\\u201d Mauer said, more firmly.</p>\\n<p>She stopped.\\xa0 Her knife and I remained where we were, the knife pointed at my throat, me halfway in leaning over the armrest, neck and head pulled away from the blade.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever he is, there are people watching, they will judge what they <em>see</em>, and that will hold more sway than anything we might say to them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Cynthia didn\\u2019t respond, and she didn\\u2019t move.\\xa0 Her eyes didn\\u2019t move off me to look at the rows of people who were sitting in attendance.</p>\\n<p>I reached out slowly, and clasped my hand firmly against the slice on my wrist.\\xa0 Short cut, but the gap opened wide, and the cup of my palm was filling with blood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019ll have scars.\\xa0 Care for the worst wounds, but there will be scars,\\u201d Mauer said, quiet, his voice probably aimed at communicating to the people at the table and <em>maybe</em> the audience members in the front row.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to say it is what we <em>should</em> do, but if you really wanted to kill him, the best way would be to strip him shirtless, make the war wounds clear, to erase some of the doubt from their minds.\\xa0 <em>Communicate</em> to the people there, with eye and ear.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>His voice was almost hypnotic.\\xa0 It nearly made this entire situation worth it, to have access to it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s stalling,\\u201d Cynthia said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSort of, but it doesn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She made a motion with the knife as if she was going to put it through my neck, but didn\\u2019t follow through.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you elaborate, Sylvester?\\u201d Fray suggested, her voice cutting through the tension.</p>\\n<p>I drew in a deep breath, then exhaled slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInstinct tells me to scare you, to drive in wedges, play up how you\\u2019re surrounded, the Brechwell Beast is loose, the help you\\u2019re expecting isn\\u2019t there anymore, and so on.\\xa0 A mix of lies and truth.\\xa0 But the reality is that Ms. Fray picked this location for a reason, she has plans, and there\\u2019s really no point in threatening you because <em>she</em> isn\\u2019t concerned, and she isn\\u2019t concerned for a reason.\\xa0 She has a way out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Eyes moved to Fray.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been assuring everyone that is the case,\\u201d Fray said, \\u201cHaving you say it <em>does</em> help them to believe it, I hope.\\xa0 Thank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cThat way out comes with a caveat.\\xa0 I\\u2019m imagining that she\\u2019s holding onto it, a deal-sealer, a clincher.\\xa0 When the time is right, she aims to tell you that yes, there is a way out, there\\u2019s a way to tie this together, and there\\u2019s a greater plan.\\xa0 <em>But</em>, let\\u2019s not forget the caveat, the two groups need to work together, or at least swear off working <em>against</em> each other.\\xa0 This will only truly work with a concerted effort.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re close enough,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve already told them what form our escape takes.\\xa0 The plays after the fact, I haven\\u2019t shared those.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hate that phrasing,\\u201d Cynthia said.\\xa0 She still had the knife pointed at me.\\xa0 \\u201cThe \\u2018plays\\u2019.\\xa0 As if this is a game.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt could be because you never experienced childhood,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia stared daggers at him.</p>\\n<p><em>Because she\\u2019s an experiment?</em></p>\\n<p><em>No.\\xa0 Because of her background.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould you rather \\u2018maneuvers\\u2019?\\u201d Fray asked, gently.\\xa0 \\u201cSome time ago, your group asked me to join, and I refused.\\xa0 Now I\\u2019m here, as per your request, and I\\u2019m trying to give you what you asked for.\\xa0 The war isn\\u2019t sustainable, we can\\u2019t maintain conflict indefinitely and still muster what we need to change things the next time it counts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was looking at each other person around the table as she talked.\\xa0 As she reached the end with Mauer, she turned her attention briefly to me.</p>\\n<p>I felt a chill.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t a chill of surprise or horror, because neither was the case.\\xa0 I\\u2019d understood this was the case before I\\u2019d even sat down.\\xa0 It was a dopamine rush, the same flood of momentary pleasure and shivers that came with listening to really good music.</p>\\n<p><em>Where we are now, she planned it in some form.\\xa0 She may have even started the war to bring things to this point</em>.</p>\\n<p>This table, with its interesting people, the danger, the strategy, it was where I belonged.</p>\\n<p>I spoke, because I wasn\\u2019t sure I\\u2019d get a chance again if I didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen I said I was here to play Promoter of the Faith, it wasn\\u2019t that I\\u2019m arguing in favor of the Academy.\\xa0 I\\u2019m genuinely curious what Fray is doing here, and I want the opportunity to hear it, knowing what I know\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I met Fray\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 She arched an eyebrow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026Coming from the background that I do,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I\\u2019m advocating for anyone, it\\u2019s the rest of you.\\xa0 I\\u2019m joining my voice to yours, questioning what she\\u2019s doing from a more objective standpoint.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou weren\\u2019t invited,\\u201d Cynthia said.</p>\\n<p>I was caught for a moment, stuck between trying to interpret her statement.\\xa0 Was it that she was saying I wasn\\u2019t asked to argue on their behalf, or was she realizing Fray hadn\\u2019t invited me here?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re my adversary, Sylvester?\\u201d Fray asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, not at all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I leaned back a little, resting my hands on a damp pants leg.\\xa0 One hand was still clasped hard to the knife wound.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m wondering whether, if what you\\u2019re offering and doing is good enough, you\\u2019re still open to having the Lambs join you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a hush, a bit of stillness.\\xa0 The audience behind me was making more noise, people making sense of the conversation, talking among themselves.</p>\\n<p>Mauer\\u2019s expression was hard to read, but his hand was fidgeting more than it had been.\\xa0 Percy was quiet, still, he\\u2019d barely spoken up, and I could see him analyzing me.\\xa0 His eye traveled to different points of the room.\\xa0 He\\u2019d been undercover for a long time, acting as a teacher while working to subvert the city through its youth, but I could almost read his mind as he looked to see if there was a physical sign of a trap.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia\\u2019s reaction was interesting, as the point of the knife dropped just a fraction.\\xa0 I let myself relax more.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere are the other Lambs in this?\\u201d Percy asked, quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey don\\u2019t know I\\u2019m here.\\xa0 But if you can convince me, then I can probably convince them.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s okay, by the way, Percy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The name was like a slap to his face.\\xa0 Had he known she was ours?\\xa0 They had so much information about us, but was he somehow in the dark?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s one of the Lambs.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve taken good care of her.\\xa0 If you asked her to come with you\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know what her answer would be.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The lines in his face hinted at emotion he was trying not to show.\\xa0 He clasped his hands together in front of him, forming a ball that bobbed up and down twice before he spoke again, \\u201cHow many lies did you tell her?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA few,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He nodded, seeming to take the statement in stride.\\xa0 \\u201cI as well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, taking that in.</p>\\n<p>I hadn\\u2019t forgotten the mice, sacrificed to make the Ghosts.\\xa0 My finger touched Melancholy\\u2019s ring, and rotated it around my thumb.</p>\\n<p>I was forced to stop as I realized I wasn\\u2019t keeping enough pressure on the bleeding wound.</p>\\n<p>Avis surprised me by speaking, \\u201cYou were such a staunch defender of the Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Fray and I spoke at the same time.</p>\\n<p>She indicated that I should speak.\\xa0 I did, saying only, \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t for the Academy.\\xa0 I was for the Lambs.\\xa0 The problem is and was that they are hard to separate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat was my interpretation of it,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI made the invitation over a year ago, and you refused me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>One of the men I didn\\u2019t know spoke, \\u201cWhat provoked this change of heart?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA Lamb died,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>I hesitated, then nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I raised my eyebrows.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re being more clever about who finds out about what.\\xa0 No, Sylvester, I admit I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs he dead, or\\u2026?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>He\\u2019s</em> dead,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Saying it aloud was hard.\\xa0 If I\\u2019d been anywhere else, anywhere at all, it might have been easier to handle.\\xa0 I could have done something, moved, turned to someone, and found a small bit of respite.</p>\\n<p>But looking one way and seeing enemies, and looking the other, seeing more, unable to really do more than squeeze my wounded wrist even harder, it was the first time in months I\\u2019d wanted to cry.</p>\\n<p>I smiled instead.\\xa0 It had done me okay so far.</p>\\n<p>Fray was nodding.\\xa0 She started to stand, and the stitched girl helped in pulling the chair away.\\xa0 Cynthia lowered the knife and stepped away from the chair to take a seat at one end of the table.</p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019s from a rough background, and while Mauer fidgeted and Percy drew quiet, she reacted with anger.\\xa0 A rat that bites when backed into a corner.</em></p>\\n<p>Looking at her companions, and at the members of the audience sitting closer to her side of the room, I suspected she was a rat with connections.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not promising defection,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhatever happens, whatever I say, you\\u2019ll want to go back to the Lambs to discuss the matter.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be ideal,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaking this all a matter of nice sounding words, tempting us with added help and the information you\\u2019d be able to provide,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLess information, without the one with the memory,\\u201d Cynthia observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrue,\\u201d Mauer said.</p>\\n<p>The two sides were agreeing, now.\\xa0 Cynthia at one end, and Mauer at the other.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wish I\\u2019d known you were doing this,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI would have tailored my plan to suit the situation, and provide a tempting reason for the Lambs to defect.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry to disappoint.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not at all disappointed, Sylvester,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Fray stood hands on the backs of the chairs to either side of her, and she had the attention of the room.\\xa0 \\u201cFor the past three days, I\\u2019ve been arguing for an end to the war.\\xa0 Not now, but soon.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve pointed out locations where key individuals can go, places they can work without being found, while still maintaining a reasonable standard of living.\\xa0 Believe me, I know how important that is.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been on the run for a year and a half.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her finger tapped on the back of the chair to her right for a second.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m proposing we take the war in a different direction.\\xa0 We leave them <em>hurting</em>, while helping everyone.\\xa0 Give them an enemy they can\\u2019t effectively fight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She reached back.\\xa0 Avis pulled something from a bag and handed it to Fray.</p>\\n<p>I almost flinched, seeing what she held.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t tailored to what I\\u2019d just been talking about?\\xa0 Bullshit.</p>\\n<p>It was a book.\\xa0 Thick, large, and heavy, with a nondescript cover.\\xa0 It made a sound as it was dropped onto the table.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t leave us in suspense,\\u201d the burly man spoke.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy\\u2019s knowledge, distilled.\\xa0 This particular volume isn\\u2019t complete, nor comprehensive, nor is it well suited for doing research.\\xa0 But it\\u2019s a starting point.\\xa0 The tools and guides necessary to walk someone through some basic experiments.\\xa0 There are other books, more complete ones for anyone who wants to advance their knowledge, and I have plans for yet more, simpler texts in simpler fields.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGiving the power to the people?\\u201d Mauer asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGiving the <em>Academy\\u2019s</em> power to the people,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 She indicated Cynthia, \\u201cGodwin\\u2019s enclave had the books, but not the means to mass produce, and the knowledge was of limited use \\u2013 they had to find doctors and ex-students to use it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was indicating Percy now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe give everyone the ability to learn, we take away the exclusive access to Academy knowledge, and our individual groups, working together, can incentivize use of the knowledge.\\xa0 Novice doctors and students will come crawling from the woodwork with their experiments, farmers will be able to create their own help instead of buying it, and everyone else will compete with the Academy for the same resources.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were murmurs in the crowd now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot a genie that can easily be put back in the bottle, is it Genevieve?\\u201d Mauer asked, with a note of humor.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did think you\\u2019d like this,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe production?\\u201d one of the men at the table asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlready set up.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll reserve further comment for when we don\\u2019t have listening ears,\\u201d Fray said, indicating me.\\xa0 \\u201cWith a coordinated effort, they won\\u2019t be able to restrict the spread of the texts <em>and</em> deal with our final forays and efforts.\\xa0 We play all of the cards we\\u2019ve been holding in reserve, and by the time the dust clears, the world will be different.\\xa0 Humanity gets a fighting chance against the monolithic Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The words and voices blended in together.</p>\\n<p>I was disappointed.</p>\\n<p>Was it change?\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 Undeniably.\\xa0 The knowledge wouldn\\u2019t be used by everyone.\\xa0 But <em>enough</em> people would pick it up.\\xa0 Back alley practices and independent experimenters would crop up.\\xa0 People like the snake charmer.\\xa0 Monsters would appear.</p>\\n<p>There would be good and bad in equal measure, and the Academy <em>would</em> hurt.\\xa0 It would be forced into a situation where it either had to take more control than it should, or lose control overall.</p>\\n<p>I suspected the former.\\xa0 I suspected it would backfire, that raids and searches for books would ensure that the fires of hatred against the Academy continued to burn.\\xa0 That the next war would be even more brutal, with the people on the ground having many more tools at their disposal.</p>\\n<p>She played the long game.\\xa0 Always the long game.</p>\\n<p>Was it a stride toward what I hoped for?\\xa0 No.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t believe that it was.\\xa0 Fray knew it wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 She\\u2019d said as much when she talked about how she\\u2019d have tailored it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Fray said, quieter.</p>\\n<p>The voice snapped me out of a train of thought.\\xa0 I realized that the groups on either side of me were talking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs it what you expected?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn a way,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I\\u2019d expected this <em>scene</em>, the groups talking, the note of hope.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019d come to me when I first asked, Jamie would be alive, wouldn\\u2019t he?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told you how things would play out.\\xa0 That a Lamb would die and you\\u2019d reconsider.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t know yet.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cYou hoped for a better brain, one that could pave the way to greater things.\\xa0 Did you hope it was Jamie?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hoped it was <em>me</em>,\\u201d I said, quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cBut Jamie was a close second.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The conversations around us continued.\\xa0 Discussion, strategy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI need to talk to them about things you can\\u2019t hear,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m going to let you go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Letting me go.\\xa0 I\\u2019d expected to be taken prisoner, maybe even tortured in an edge case, but torture was something I could deal with, and had dealt with in the past.\\xa0 I waited for elaboration.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn the condition that you leave <em>that</em> behind<em>,\\u201d </em>she said.</p>\\n<p>She was pointing.</p>\\n<p>I turned to look, and felt the tug against one shoulder before I realized.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s no other way.\\xa0 I can convince them, but you need to convince <em>me</em> first.\\xa0 I figured out what was in that oddly shaped bag you refused to take off and place at your feet.\\xa0 I remember the last time I met the Lambs.\\xa0 I remember Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I touched the strap of the backpack.\\xa0 The books were inside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I\\u2019d rather be taken prisoner?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen they\\u2019ll kill you,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 The word seemed to get attention, because one or two conversations stopped.\\xa0 \\u201cI know them better than you do, and they\\u2019ll kill you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Almost thirty seconds passed before I slipped my shoulders free of the straps.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t read them.\\xa0 If you do-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cNone of us will.\\xa0 Hand them to me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I placed the bag on the table.</p>\\n<p>It was hard, seeing Fray take it, lifting it free of the table and handing it to the stitched girl.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNobody gets to take that bag, or touch or read the books inside except him,\\u201d Fray told the stitched girl.\\xa0 \\u201cNot even me.\\xa0 He gets it back when he comes tomorrow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart was pounding harder than it had all night.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re <em>staying?</em>\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo long as we don\\u2019t venture outside, the Beast poses little risk to us,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have one night to decide.\\xa0 Go and sleep on it if you must.\\xa0 Next time you come, come with the rest of the Lambs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart felt cold in my chest as I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t suppose I have much of a choice, do I?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/lips-sealed-3-9/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>\\u201cDepending on who was part of our trio here, I\\u2019d adjust my strategy,\\u201d I voiced my thoughts aloud.\\xa0 \\u201cIf it were Gordon and Mary, I\\u2019d talk to them about battle plans, where we could get weapons, stuff we could improvise.\\xa0 I\\u2019d turn my own talents toward finding and putting together something that would buy the two of them an opportunity.\\xa0 If it was Lillian that was part of the group, either of them, and me, I\\u2019d have Lillian use her knowledge of science stuff to do the finding, and I\\u2019d be a distraction, while Gordon could be point man.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>The hallway was dark.\\xa0 The bugs were everywhere, but they weren\\u2019t landing on us, as far as I could tell.\\xa0 We also lacked any strange guests.\\xa0 The wall-crawlers hadn\\u2019t followed us up this far.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd with us?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re intimately familiar with the Bowels, Jamie remembers the past interviews we\\u2019ve done?\\u201d\\xa0 I made it a question, directed at Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI remember what I was told about.\\xa0 I sat in on half the interviews we\\u2019ve done, I glanced over some of the files for the other half.\\xa0 Seventy five percent?\\xa0 Give or take?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow many labs is that, that you\\u2019re aware of?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo hundred and two.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow many labs are you <em>unfamiliar</em> with?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNinety eight.\\xa0 Two were unoccupied.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re armed with knowledge.\\xa0 The trick is to find out how to use that knowledge.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>She\\u2019s</em> armed with knowledge, too,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe knows more than I do about this place.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think we can beat her that way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut let\\u2019s keep our eyes open for opportunity.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t suppose there\\u2019s anything we could access or cut that would let us shut down an area without actually being in that area?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen shook her head.\\xa0 \\u201cThings were built like they were built in case of invasion.\\xa0 If the enemy or enemy agents came in and tried to get at some of the labs to obtain tools to use against the Academy, those within could drop the ceiling and seal things off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat about the mechanisms upstairs, then?\\xa0 They have to be able to raise the stone blocks after.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTeams of stitched at a wheel, and a switchboard,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cNeed the right configuration on the board for a given tunnel, or it locks up when you order the stitched to turn the wheel, and only certain individuals can order the stitched.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne way to stop Sub Rosa for good would be to follow her into one of the hallways, get to one of the panels where she reworked the security, and undo that work.\\xa0 Seal ourselves in with her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s an option,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDepending on how Gorger is doing, we could do that, sacrifice one of <em>us</em> to remove her from play, then let Gorger clean up the bugs and the wall-crawlers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d he said, more forcefully.\\xa0 \\u201cDo I need to list reasons, Sy?\\xa0 I know you\\u2019d want to be the one to sacrifice yourself for us, and I\\u2019m not willing to let you do that.\\xa0 If one of us dies, we grow weaker as a group.\\xa0 Whatever comes tomorrow, or next week, next month, next <em>year</em>\\u2026 we need <em>everyone</em>.\\xa0 I expect that every single one of us is preparing on some level for what you\\u2019ve talked about.\\xa0 The expiration dates.\\xa0 <em>You</em> most of all, Sly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019ve been <em>preparing</em>,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I\\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s what I meant,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cJust like with any problem, when things start going south, we\\u2019ll each approach it from our individual angles, we\\u2019ll support each other\\u2019s strengths and shore up each other\\u2019s weaknesses.\\xa0 But everyone, <em>anyone</em> that we lose, that weakens us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI can see that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not losing anyone,\\u201d Jamie said, and his voice was tight.\\xa0 \\u201cNot if there\\u2019s a chance of saving them.\\xa0 You\\u2019re not sacrificing yourself for the sake of the rest of us.\\xa0 Especially when it\\u2019s not guaranteed to work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>His voice cracked a little, and I didn\\u2019t think it was puberty.</p>\\n<p>For once, I didn\\u2019t have a ready reply.\\xa0 The emotion he was exhibiting, it made it hard to say something, when I wouldn\\u2019t be able to match it or acknowledge it.</p>\\n<p>It was Helen who leaned close and gave Jamie a peck on the cheek, leaving behind a kiss mark of the powder Lillian had used mixed with the chemicals we\\u2019d covered ourselves in.\\xa0 A pale version of the mark lipstick might leave.\\xa0 I saw the tightness disappear from his shoulders in response to that simple gesture.\\xa0 The tension was broken, and I was free to comment and speak.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat about manipulating some sap into doing it for us?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGod, Sy, <em>really</em>?\\u201d he asked, incredulous.</p>\\n<p>But I was already cracking a grin.\\xa0 I saw Jamie shake his head, but he allowed himself a smile.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d lightened things up a little.\\xa0 That paved the way for more serious discussion.\\xa0 Jamie was more sensitive than the rest of us.\\xa0 He had the least blood on his hands, next to Lillian.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been holding that in for a while,\\u201d I said, no longer poking fun at him.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat you said before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust a little while,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s been worse for the past bit.\\xa0 Past hour, I guess.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeeing you almost die?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve almost died loads of times,\\u201d I said, cavalier.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not the first time you\\u2019ve said that,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh.\\xa0 Because it\\u2019s true.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not the first time you\\u2019ve said it, and yet you said it <em>differently </em>here,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI just thought back to all the other times, your expression, your body language, your <em>tone-</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGeez!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said it in a different way because you feel different about it.\\xa0 This time was different, it was <em>closer</em>.\\xa0 You know it, I know it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I chewed on that for a bit, as we headed to the stairs again.\\xa0 When we reached the staircase itself, I stopped.\\xa0 We needed to decide where to go and what to do, but with Jamie feeling emotional and the current topic of conversation, I doubted I could get him to let things lie.</p>\\n<p>No, that was a fib.\\xa0 I could get him to let things be, but no matter how gently I did it, I would be dropping a conversation that was critically important to Jamie.\\xa0 I would be acting evasive, and that would hurt him, given the situation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I admitted.\\xa0 \\u201cI came closer than ever.\\xa0 For a second or two, I knew there was nothing I could do, and I was okay with it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI experience that moment sometimes,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen I\\u2019m strangling someone to death, I see it in their eyes, I hear it in the noises they\\u2019re making, when they stop <em>straining</em> for breath.\\xa0 I feel it in how they fight and twitch and struggle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t ever want to experience that moment again,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I looked at Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201cBelieve me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI believe you,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I could have changed the topic, hurried us along, but\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOur friends are unconscious, and I nearly died.\\xa0 Is that why you\\u2019re wound so tight right now?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie made a face, raising a hand to fix his goggles.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t look like he was planning on responding.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told you my inner thoughts,\\u201d I prodded him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 For a second, I wasn\\u2019t sure if he was admitting that he was wound tight, or if there was more to it.\\xa0 There was more to it, apparently, because he said, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t recognize Sub Rosa.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI recognize <em>everyone</em>, Sy.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve walked by that picture that Gladys mentioned\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He trailed off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie?\\u201d I asked, and I felt genuinely worried.\\xa0 It was a weird place to stop talking, and he wasn\\u2019t immune to the stings.\\xa0 Not that <em>I</em> was, but still.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSixteen times,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve walked by it sixteen times.\\xa0 I looked Sub Rosa directly in the eyes, several times.\\xa0 The connection didn\\u2019t happen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, putting a hand on his shoulder.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure what to say.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI haven\\u2019t talked about it before, because Gordon really doesn\\u2019t like it being brought up, but I do know how I probably expire.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m supposed to remember things, Sy.\\xa0 And now we\\u2019re down here, and I know I\\u2019m supposed to be thinking things through, sorting through all the maps and details about the labs, all the paperwork I glipmsed, to piece together a plan or find a way out, but all I can think about is\\u2026 I\\u2019m supposed to remember things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My hand on his shoulder became a hug.\\xa0 He was clutching his book, so he didn\\u2019t return it, his knuckles jabbing at my chest as I squeezed him as tight as he could bear.</p>\\n<p>When I pulled away, I saw that Helen was stroking his hair, patting him like a dog.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing we can do about that right now,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to figure out a plan of attack,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 Helen nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere are you at, in terms of thinking through the options with the labs you\\u2019ve seen or read about?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going over it a second time, more in depth,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not finding much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe paperwork, about Sub Rosa?\\xa0 Do any people the creator has worked with work down here?\\xa0 On similar projects, even?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie shook his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFast response.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI already considered it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamn,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat leaves us three options.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat options?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOption one is that we knock on doors.\\xa0 Visit all the labs you don\\u2019t remember reading about, hope there\\u2019s a weapon, tool, or threat there that we can use.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShot in the dark,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cOption <em>two</em> is that we turn to you, Helen.\\xa0 If this place was prepared for wartime, it\\u2019s not inconceivable that there could be secret tunnels, defenses, or stockpiles that might help in the event that the Bowels were attacked.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot inconceivable,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut if those things existed, Sub Rosa would know about them.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 That was a spooky thing to consider.\\xa0 Sub Rosa with access to weapons and secret tunnels.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s option three?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOption three depends on you being a little less clever than you are,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Less</em> clever?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t going to go over well with the Academy,\\u201d Jamie commented.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cProbably not,\\u201d I agreed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s not even guaranteed to work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d I agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cNo guarantees.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I took the stairs two at a time.\\xa0 Helen followed.\\xa0 Jamie was a bit slower, relying on the railing to keep himself steady as he tried to match the pace.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A pack of wall-crawlers surrounded us, many on the walls, and we kept making our way up, helping to put more of them behind us.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s a shame we didn\\u2019t have paint,\\u201d Helen commented.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cPaint?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBright colors.\\xa0 Most things know that you don\\u2019t eat the bright colored animals.\\xa0 Bees, poisonous frogs, caterpillars\\u2026\\xa0 We could have helped ourselves out by painting our skin.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t help with stealth, and we might need to be sneaky,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMight,\\u201d Helen agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cBut those things hurt.\\xa0 I\\u2019d rather get caught and deal with that than have ten of <em>them </em>grab me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Ugh.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">They dropped down around us, reaching out to grab the railings, and to grab <em>us</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It stung like a hundred bee stings, and I stumbled, falling onto the stairs I\\u2019d been ascending.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But it stung the creature, too.\\xa0 The tendrils didn\\u2019t cover much of my arm at all before they retracted, the creature pulling away, backing off, snorting and honking violently, like some bastard offspring of a goose, pig, and cow.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I screamed at it, a sound not nearly as good as Helen\\u2019s hiss earlier, but I wanted to drive the point home, bully these things.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The others were receiving the same reaction.\\xa0 The creatures that had attacked them retreated, making an unearthly series of violent noises.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen lunged out, grabbing the one that had attacked her.\\xa0 It struggled, tendrils automatically going out, then pulling back just as fast.\\xa0 She heaved it toward the gap in the railing.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Tendrils surrounded the railing.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen kicked out, catching it in the stomach with her foot.\\xa0 Its feet flailed, but it was just small enough it couldn\\u2019t find purchase.\\xa0 It held on by the tendrils alone.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen screamed in its face, then pressed the back of her hand to the stem of the tendrils.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The creature made more noise, squealing, squawking, kicking harder.\\xa0 Tendrils went out, touched her leg, and retreated.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When the pain became too much, it retracted the tendrils that were holding the railing.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Without hands or feet to grab with, it dropped down the length of the shaft.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">All of the creatures near us backed away a fraction.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen turned her attention to a smaller one, probably looking to make another example, driving the point home.\\xa0 But my focus was on the largest of them, the tension in its arms, and the way that it had retreated less than the others.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It wasn\\u2019t courage alone.\\xa0 This one was the leader of the pack.\\xa0 Or if it hadn\\u2019t been, it had been promoted with the demise of the one Helen had sent to the bottom floor.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHelen,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYes, Sy?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 Her hands were out to her side, painted fingernails spread out.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThree o\\u2019clock.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">No sooner were the words out of my mouth, than she reached out and grabbed the big one.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It fought harder than its predecessor had, legs catching the railing, hands flailing, striking out with both hands, neither one getting any particular surface area with the reflexive reaction to the chemicals.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen ducked down, grabbed its ankles, and hauled it down.\\xa0 The tendrils resisted, holding on firmly.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I lunged forward, and slammed my left hand down on the tendrils, probably doing more damage to my hand than to the tendrils.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Still, the tendrils retracted, and Helen had her opportunity.\\xa0 She hauled down on the leg, almost tearing the creature off, but it grabbed on with both hands, and snapped at her face.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She didn\\u2019t brook such nonsense.\\xa0 She caught the thing around the neck, then twisted it back and around.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Once she had her grip on the necessary parts, it was essentially over.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The creature was pulled against the railing, genitalia sticking straight out, something resembling the inside of a conch shell, though it protruded.\\xa0 Hermaphroditic.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It struggled.\\xa0 Helen screamed at it, and briefly tightened her grip, twisting it further, then relaxed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She held it like that.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I\\u2019d expected her to kill it.\\xa0 But she wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 While she had the biggest of the group, the rest were holding back, waiting and watching.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She let it try struggling a few more times.\\xa0 Each time, she screamed at it and twisted its limbs a little more.\\xa0 On the third time, she bit it on the ribs, then hauled it off and away, heaving it over to the exterior wall to our left.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It started to scramble away.\\xa0 She made a start toward it, screaming once, and it froze.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It looked at me, and she screamed at it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was all hunched over now, tendrils spread out about as far as it seemed they could go.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen bent low, one hand going automatically to her skirt, pressing it down, the polite way of avoiding flashing people when bending down, the other hand going around the creature\\u2019s throat.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It started to react, and it got another sharp screaming sound from Helen.\\xa0 It stopped, all limbs touching ground, simply accepting having its throat held.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She had it firmly in her grip, and it was nothing to do with her muscles or hands.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She pointed, then shoved it down the stairs.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t tumble, but it did move.\\xa0 The remainder of the pack moved in the same direction, and one got too close to Helen.\\xa0 She made a lunging motion at it, screaming, and it scrambled over to the wall to get away, over, and to the remainder of its pack.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We started back up the stairs.\\xa0 The wall-crawlers went in the other direction, <em>down</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI thought you were going to keep him for a pet,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m not allowed pets,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI meant more in the sense that you\\u2019d take over the pack, then we\\u2019d have a few soldiers to use against Sub Rosa.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWouldn\\u2019t work,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cToo slow, getting from here to there while trying to keep them in line.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThen why not toss him?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey\\u2019re social.\\xa0 They communicate, I think.\\xa0 It might help, having them communicating to the others, telling them we\\u2019re dangerous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHm,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDon\\u2019t you think so?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cInteresting that you\\u2019re thinking along those lines, though,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She gave me a smile and a curtsey at that.\\xa0 \\u201cTo be interesting is the highest of compliments when coming from you, sir Sylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I smiled back.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m bleeding,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou are too, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I felt the back of my neck, where I\\u2019d been touched, and my fingers came away crimson.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHere,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She handed me the jar of powder Lillian had been using.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Rather than use the dabbing sponge, I reached in, grabbed some, and slapped it on the general area where it was sore, before handing it to Jamie.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Onward, upward.</p>\\n<p>Third floor.</p>\\n<p>We made our way through, my eyes following the number of each lab.</p>\\n<p><em>Twenty-two</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>We reached the lab, and I pounded on the door.\\xa0 It swung lightly ajar at that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf this turns out badly, I\\u2019m going to be silently judging you,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhile we die, anyway.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNoted,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I ventured into the lab, and scanned the surroundings.\\xa0 A small size, as labs went, ten paces by ten paces in size.</p>\\n<p>The counter on one end of the room featured a glass tube, capped with metal at both ends, the two caps held together by a locking mechanism.\\xa0 Crimson fluid swirled within.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGas.\\xa0 One more weapon for the Academy created weapons of war to use on the enemies of the Crown,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt won\\u2019t stop her.\\xa0 It might distract or weaken her, but that\\u2019s only going to buy us a chance,\\u201d Jamie told me.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd, I feel the need to stress this, we\\u2019re not immune.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I agreed.\\xa0 I looked at the fluid.\\xa0 \\u201cI get that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie had been searching through every memory of paperwork and every interview he\\u2019d participated in, to figure out what we might be able to use against Sub Rosa.\\xa0 Things that might hurt her or set her back.</p>\\n<p>But he was too clever a boy.\\xa0 He searched through his head, but he did it with rules.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t allow himself to consider weapons that were as likely or <em>more</em> likely to hurt us than to hurt Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>This was one such weapon, the size of two paint cans, stacked one on top of the other.</p>\\n<p>While Jamie and I talked, Helen was going through cabinets.\\xa0 I joined her in doing the same.</p>\\n<p>We found two more canisters, much like the first, but the fluids inside were crystal clear.</p>\\n<p>I looked to Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWater,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>My face fell.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut we can use it,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cHow?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a dispersal system.\\xa0 We\\u2019re filling the air with a thick gas, diluted with water vapor.\\xa0 We use <em>these</em>, we dilute it further, but we make the cloud bigger.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Decreasing the chance we miss</em>.</p>\\n<p>The mental pictures were becoming clear in my mind\\u2019s eye.\\xa0 This wouldn\\u2019t kill her, it wouldn\\u2019t even hurt her that badly.</p>\\n<p>If it touched us, if we screwed up, then it would hurt us badly, if it didn\\u2019t kill us outright.</p>\\n<p>My struggles with Sub Rosa thus far had been because she\\u2019d been implacable, unstoppable.</p>\\n<p>Now I had the means to push and pull.\\xa0 I had the strings with which I could move Sub Rosa, for the briefest time.</p>\\n<p>But what play to enact with the puppet, for the greatest effect?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you thinking?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat exactly does this stuff do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFlesh eating virus,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReally?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEssentially.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at the red tube with a newfound respect.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t drop it,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou could.\\xa0 In fact, I think I\\u2019ll take it, just to be sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t drop it!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet me have it.\\xa0 You can hold my book.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 I wanna be the one to unleash the flesh-eating plague!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll hand it over when it\\u2019s time, but I don\\u2019t want you unleashing it on <em>us</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot intentionally, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBoys,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>Our heads turned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m taking it,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m physically incapable of dropping it by accident.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d I started.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCarry the other ones, please,\\u201d she told us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut\\u2026\\u201d I said, trailing off.\\xa0 She met my puppy dog eyes with that infuriating, cute little smile of hers.</p>\\n<p>I walked to the cabinet with the canisters of water, then grabbed the first.</p>\\n<p>I was sweaty, and I had the powder on my hand, which hurt traction rather than helping it.\\xa0 The glass case tipped over and <em>clunked</em> hard against the floor.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShut up,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t say anything,\\u201d Jamie said, in the smuggest of tones.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt didn\\u2019t break, anyway.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShut up,\\u201d I told him, again, before grabbing the thing and heaving it up and off the ground.</p>\\n<p>Jamie considered a moment, then left his book behind, taking the thing in both hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have the means of moving Sub Rosa the way we need her to move,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe could bring her up.\\xa0 With the right tools, we might even be able to send her down.\\xa0 We can make her stand still\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have the means of stopping her, when it comes down to it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Therein lay the rub.</p>\\n<p>A person was only technically dead when their heart stopped, but even that definition was vague, because the Academy had kept people alive without hearts in their chests, using machines to pump.</p>\\n<p>Heart and brain.\\xa0 When one or both ceased to function, Sub Rosa stopped.</p>\\n<p>We lacked the tools to destroy either.\\xa0 There might be guns here and there, but that relied on luck.\\xa0 Severing the brainstem, or striking the heart, through the armor-like layer of the cocoon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIdeas, Sy?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt depends on things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s amazingly vague,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m feeling inspired by some of the villains from the dime store novels,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to think big.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow mad do you think Gordon would be if I used Shipman as bait?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe likes her,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think he fully grasps it,\\u201d Jamie commented, \\u201cBut yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m asking,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019d probably forgive you, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut he\\u2019d be mad,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>And what we\\u2019re not saying is that time is limited.\\xa0 Do I really want months or years of time with Gordon to be eaten up with him upset at me?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s something Sub Rosa wants,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 But we can work around it.\\xa0 We should drop these off and scout.\\xa0 See where she is and what she\\u2019s doing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were nods from the two.</p>\\n<p>This felt doable.\\xa0 The lack of a means to deliver a sure killing blow was a big hole in the plan, but one that could be worked around.</p>\\n<p>The possibilities that unfolded in my mind were good ones, <em>fun</em> ones.</p>\\n<p>Ones that people would remember.</p>\\n<p>We carried the glass canisters halfway down, to the fifth floor, and we left them at the exit of the hallway, just by the stairs.</p>\\n<p>Slowly, we crept down, past the swarm of bugs who refused to land on us, past the black wall crawlers, who snorted and honked, while refusing to draw near.\\xa0 Warning sounds, I presumed, passed from one group to the next.</p>\\n<p>Social creatures.</p>\\n<p>Past the sixth floor.\\xa0 A whole section of railing and stairway was broken.\\xa0 From the fight between Sub Rosa and Gorger.</p>\\n<p>From the bodies in the hallway, though, I could assume that Gorger hadn\\u2019t gone into the hallway.\\xa0 If he had, he would have scraped them against the floor.</p>\\n<p>Down another floor.\\xa0 Seventh.\\xa0 The way was locked, the door broken, but not broken away.\\xa0 Gorger hadn\\u2019t gone there either, and I doubted he would have left Sub Rosa to her own devices.</p>\\n<p>Down to the eighth floor.</p>\\n<p>Bottom floor.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was there.\\xa0 People in lab coats were working to tear away wall panels, while she stood there, a metal spike extended in their general direction.\\xa0 Another cluster of people in lab coats was gathered against the wall, huddled together.\\xa0 Twenty, thirty, maybe forty.</p>\\n<p>Gorger lay against the opposite wall.\\xa0 He breathed, but he was limp, the fight gone out of him.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d lost to Sub Rosa, who had been his father in a way.\\xa0 Yes, she was female, but she\\u2019d had a fatherlike role in his creation, providing the seed and the means for the man to become the monster, and now she had struck him down.</p>\\n<p>We couldn\\u2019t use the gas like this.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to use Shipman, to draw her up,\\u201d I whispered.</p>\\n<p>There was no response from either of the others.\\xa0 They were studying the scene.</p>\\n<p><em>Are they making a way out?\\xa0 Or is this like something I suggested to Helen?\\xa0 A weapon cache?\\xa0 A tunnel?\\xa0 A last-ditch measure?</em></p>\\n<p>On the broad bottom of the shaft, a doctor happened to look up, and saw us.\\xa0 I could just barely see the whites of her eyes.</p>\\n<p>She gestured.\\xa0 Telling us to run, maybe.</p>\\n<p><em>Rescuing the children</em>.</p>\\n<p>She gestured again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s go,\\u201d I whispered.\\xa0 My legs were already feeling like lead, from so much travel up and down stairs in short time.\\xa0 I had the information I needed to put a plan in action.</p>\\n<p>But my memory wasn\\u2019t good.\\xa0 Just to be safe, I looked back, ready to commit the scene to memory, so I could better move the pieces when it came down to it.</p>\\n<p>It was only that last glance that let me see the subtle events unfold.</p>\\n<p>The gesturing movement, urging us to run, it had been seen by others in the crowd.\\xa0 Many of them looked up at us.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa, watching over the crowd out of the corner of her eye, turned.\\xa0 Not all of the heads were fast to look away or distract.</p>\\n<p>She followed their gaze, and she saw us.</p>\\n<p>It seemed she was still angry.\\xa0 She moved, as fast as she was able, ascending the stairs.</p>\\n<p>Chasing.</p>\\n<p><em>At least we won\\u2019t have a problem baiting her upstairs.</em></p>\\n<p>Problem was, I now had <em>zero</em> minutes to pull off a serious deathtrap I\\u2019d expected to take ten or twenty.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/06/13/lips-sealed-3-10/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>We weren\\u2019t going to get away this time.</p>\\n<p>She was taller, stronger, and as hurt as she was, she kept going without faltering.\\xa0 Her face still had a gaping hole in the side of it where several bullets had hit, filled with what looked like a big blood clot, and she had other injuries she might have sustained doing battle with Gorger, but she wasn\\u2019t staggering anymore.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d expected that, even if we\\u2019d been seen, we could outrun her or match her pace.\\xa0 She was healing, however, or she\\u2019d pulled herself together.\\xa0 She was making good time.\\xa0 Better than we were.</p>\\n<p>I was quick on my feet, and I had a good sense of where my body was and how to move.\\xa0 Jamie and Helen weren\\u2019t runners.\\xa0 Humans had evolved not to outrun prey, but to keep running.\\xa0 Helen wasn\\u2019t human, and as fine a piece of craftsmanship as she was, there were tradeoffs when playing to different strengths.\\xa0 Jamie just wasn\\u2019t quick or coordinated, he stumbled, I caught him, he faltered, and I pulled him onward.</p>\\n<p>She was going to catch us.\\xa0 The next hallway was still a little ways up, the canisters of water vapor and plague more than a little ways up.\\xa0 We wouldn\\u2019t reach it first.</p>\\n<p>Those people who had stared at us and warned us to run had doomed us.</p>\\n<p>I looked back, still running, and I saw Sub Rosa\\u2019s steady advance.\\xa0 She kept one hand on the railing, hauled herself up with arm strength as well as strides.</p>\\n<p>I contemplated throwing myself toward her.\\xa0 Ascending the stairs, there had to be a point where, with a push or a collision with a leaping eleven year old, that she\\u2019d tip over backward.</p>\\n<p>The fact that she was gripping the railing, hauling herself up, gripping it, hauling herself up, a steady pattern, it narrowed that window of opportunity.</p>\\n<p>What were the odds?\\xa0 One in twenty?\\xa0 One in fifty?</p>\\n<p><em>Wait for the right moment, pivot, leap.\\xa0</em> It would barely inconvenience her, maybe break the glass cases attached to the body that she was using for the spike.\\xa0 It would kill me, or she would kill me shortly after, yet the other two would have a chance at getting away.</p>\\n<p>An hour ago, I wouldn\\u2019t have waited to do it.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s speech made me hesitate, want to be absolutely <em>sure </em>there was no other choice.\\xa0 I glanced back, gauging distance, helped Jamie run, then checked again, to see how fast she was gaining on us.</p>\\n<p>In the spaces between where her lips were sealed together, the lips parted, sucking in and huffing out breath.\\xa0 The fluid <em>flew</em> through the tubes that had been implanted in her.</p>\\n<p>I let go of Jamie\\u2019s hand.</p>\\n<p>Jamie seized my wrist a heartbeat later, and this time, <em>he</em> was the one that hauled me up and forward.\\xa0 A second wind, or a surge of desperate strength.</p>\\n<p>I kept going, only because I didn\\u2019t want to slow him down by fighting him or lagging behind.\\xa0 In my heart, I knew it wasn\\u2019t enough, but I couldn\\u2019t simply acknowledge the fact, accept it and carry on with the original plan when he was trying so <em>damn</em> hard.</p>\\n<p>Somewhere along the line, I failed to estimate things right.\\xa0 I misjudged how much time had passed, or Sub Rosa had managed a second wind or burst of speed in the same way Jamie did.</p>\\n<p>Jamie startled, his uniform jacket pulled tight against his chest, and he let go of my wrist.</p>\\n<p>He looked at me, not Sub Rosa, in the moment before she swept him into the wall.\\xa0 A swiping motion, right to left, but it had enough force to break him.\\xa0 Two dozen individual parts of Jamie cracked and percussed against the wall all in one horrible sound, before his body slumped to the stairs at the base of the wall.\\xa0 His book tumbled down the stairs, and it just kept going, end over end, opening, carrying down, then closing itself before sliding down another few steps.</p>\\n<p>I continued another few steps up on momentum alone, tripping and almost falling because I wasn\\u2019t looking where I was going, before reality caught up to me.\\xa0 Sub Rosa had stopped, so I stopped and turned to confront her.</p>\\n<p>Jamie\\u2019s book came to rest, the hard cover bent.</p>\\n<p>Bugs swirled, the wall-crawlers continued their eerie movements along the surfaces around us, but we were still.\\xa0 Sub Rosa was just a step away from being exactly in between me and Jamie.\\xa0 Helen was further up the stairs, but only by a bit.</p>\\n<p>My blood pounded in my ears, my mind raced so much I wasn\\u2019t sure I trusted it, as I tried and failed to see a way forward, something that would help Jamie.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t get by Sub Rosa, bait her downstairs, and keep her busy somehow while sending one of the doctors to help Jamie, assuming he was alive.\\xa0 I wouldn\\u2019t make it.\\xa0 I knew it.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t outrun her, I didn\\u2019t have the tools, and the doctor wouldn\\u2019t risk Sub Rosa\\u2019s wrath by going.\\xa0 She\\u2019d had them cowed, down there.\\xa0 The dead bodies suggested <em>how</em>.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t scream for them to come up and help him, again, because they wouldn\\u2019t go, because they wouldn\\u2019t hear.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t go down and force one to come with me and help Jamie on pain of death, because that would mean Helen had to deal with Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t, I couldn\\u2019t, I <em>couldn\\u2019t.\\xa0 </em>The thoughts dissolved into a haze of <em>couldn\\u2019t</em><em>s </em>and the haze was an angry one, the pounding of blood in my ears and <em>eyes</em> intense enough that I could see my heart beating, my field of vision throbbing.</p>\\n<p>It was the polar opposite of what I\\u2019d experienced in my moment of near death. My thoughts then had gone quiet.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been able to stop <em>thinking</em>.\\xa0 Right now they were anything but quiet.</p>\\n<p>My thought was crystal clear, and it was well modulated, not a scream or an incoherent shout.</p>\\n<p><em>This is what it\\u2019s like to see red, </em>was my thought.\\xa0 Which was odd, because things seemed more blue-green, as if we were underwater.</p>\\n<p>I wished it was more productive.\\xa0 That my surge of emotion and the clarity for my most destructive thoughts could provide a way to <em>end</em> her right this moment.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Helen said, behind me.\\xa0 She sounded so <em>normal</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes?\\u201d I asked, my voice just as everyday as hers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing you can do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa wasn\\u2019t holding onto the railing anymore.\\xa0 If I could knock her down the stairs, so she might fall like Jamie\\u2019s book had\\u2026 no.\\xa0 It wouldn\\u2019t hurt her enough.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Helen said, with more emphasis.</p>\\n<p><em>I want to tear those staples out of her mouth so she can talk, then challenge her, call her out, break the arrogant, insane bitch.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d I admitted, aloud.\\xa0 \\u201cBut Ja-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stopped, cleared my throat so I could speak more clearly, found no word came out, and only managed something on a third try, changing the affect of the word, making it flat, whisper-quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know he doesn\\u2019t want you to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Doesn\\u2019t</em>, not <em>wouldn\\u2019t</em>.\\xa0 I looked at the body, my eyes automatically moving away from the broken form, then made myself look again.\\xa0 I blinked, and my eyes stung with the sweat mingled with the stuff I\\u2019d rubbed on my skin and in my hair to keep the bugs off and make the wall crawlers less inclined to hold on to me.</p>\\n<p>He was breathing.</p>\\n<p>The relief was so profound I found myself grabbing the railing to steady myself.</p>\\n<p>Anger was replaced with fear.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa still had the spike extending from her left hand.\\xa0 She was closer to Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like to talk,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She shook her head slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie doesn\\u2019t want you to take the risk.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Jamie doesn\\u2019t want to die.\\xa0 If we leave him with her</em><em>, he\\u2019ll die.\\xa0 If we leave him without getting him help, he\\u2019ll die.\\xa0 We\\u2019re all supposed to live, aren\\u2019t we?</em></p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t voice the words.\\xa0 I needed to open a dialogue with Sub Rosa, find a chink in the armor, a weak point, or <em>something</em>.</p>\\n<p>Her attention moved to Jamie.\\xa0 Helen\\u2019s fault.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSupervisor,\\u201d I said, my voice firm, authoritative.\\xa0 A desperate stab at evoking something from the days when she\\u2019d had a different sort of power.</p>\\n<p>It worked.\\xa0 Her head turned a degree.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEarlier, not long after we crossed paths, you stroked my hair.\\xa0 The others, the people who remember, they\\u2019ve painted you as a monster, the person you once were and who you are now.\\xa0 They laid the blame at your feet, saying you\\u2019re why the Academy is so strict and results-focused.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could see the tension in her face building with each statement I made.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut a real monster doesn\\u2019t have that gentleness to them,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>My eyes strained to find a sign that I was getting through to her.\\xa0 If there were any changes, I couldn\\u2019t be sure if I was really seeing them or if I <em>wanted</em> to.</p>\\n<p>I was usually so good about these things.</p>\\n<p>Just as I\\u2019d done against Mauer, I fell back on fundamentals.\\xa0 \\u2018Us versus them\\u2019 was an approach that almost always worked, framing an enemy, making myself and the others out to be part of \\u2018us\\u2019.\\xa0 But we\\u2019d betrayed that expectation when Gordon had shot her.</p>\\n<p>Something else, then.</p>\\n<p>Establishing a rapport, humanizing.\\xa0 A good technique for a hostage to use against a hostage taker, it could mean a turnaround in a situation, being released, or it could buy a moment of hesitation.</p>\\n<p>In this case, the humanizing was anything but, because I had to talk about monstrous things.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know what the Academy does,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not like other children.\\xa0 Neither is <em>she</em>, and neither is <em>he, </em>that much should be obvious.\\xa0 Believe me when I say that we know the sort of pain you\\u2019ve experienced.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her hand went up, and it touched the wounded eye and side of her head, where the blood had congealed to a jellylike consistency, the overall structure of her face devastated and mostly caved in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m talking about the other kind of pain.\\xa0 Being slowly and surely twisted for the agenda of others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her body language was all the reply I needed.\\xa0 Her hand was slow to drop away from the hole in her face, as if to say, <em>but this isn\\u2019t forgotten</em>, or <em>you deceived me once</em>.</p>\\n<p>She turned back to Jamie, and I felt a yawning hollowness inside at the realization that I probably couldn\\u2019t stop her, whatever happened next.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou-\\u201d Jamie croaked the word.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa moved the point of the spike toward him.\\xa0 I hated to think what convulsing might do when so many of his bones were probably broken.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have\\u2026 a nephew,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 Each word or pair of words was labored, forced.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t stab him or touch him with the spike.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHis name\\u2026 Edward.\\xa0 Year older\\u2026 than me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was no reaction on Sub Rosa\\u2019s part.\\xa0 Her expression was already warped by the staples and the portion of the cocoon that was draped over and around her head.\\xa0 A bug-eyed stare.</p>\\n<p>Behind us, one of the wall crawlers got a little close.\\xa0 Helen hissed at it, scaring it off.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa didn\\u2019t need to hiss.\\xa0 She was big and scary enough that she apparently didn\\u2019t look like prey to the wall crawlers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2026 not\\u2026\\xa0 Academy.\\xa0 Works\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Each word seemed more painful to get out.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t twitching a muscle as he talked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRuns errands\\u2026 passes on messages\\u2026 for factory owner.\\xa0 His uncle, named Baxter.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The pieces fell into place with that.</p>\\n<p>Baxter was a known name.\\xa0 The family was wealthy, well liked.\\xa0 The job of assisting a factory owner was believable, but paralleled Sub Rosa\\u2019s own experience to a slight degree.\\xa0 She was the <em>supervisor</em>, and it was obviously a core part of her identity.</p>\\n<p>Everything Jamie was doing was calculated using known variables.\\xa0 Probably some I hadn\\u2019t considered or ones I wasn\\u2019t aware of, drawn from Jamie\\u2019s recollection, and some informed by my desperate stab at gaining sympathy or connecting to her better side.</p>\\n<p>I felt Helen touch my shoulder.\\xa0 She\\u2019d drawn closer.</p>\\n<p><em>Everything he\\u2019s doing, including the plodding, speed of his every utterance.</em></p>\\n<p>Buying time.</p>\\n<p>There was no saying how long we had.\\xa0 I feared it might be no time at all, that Sub Rosa\\u2019s anger might outweigh her attachment to family.\\xa0 That, as Helen and I made a run for it, leaving Sub Rosa and Jamie behind, she might give chase, and that one of us might get caught and utterly destroyed in the same way Jamie had.</p>\\n<p>My hand found Helen\\u2019s.\\xa0 As she stumbled, fatigue catching up with her, I caught her with my shoulder in her armpit, bracing her with my entire body, scraping a shin against a stair while the both of us recovered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrave boy,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t talking about me.</p>\\n<p>How long before Jamie ran out of things to say, or worse, said the wrong thing, and tipped Sub Rosa off to the fact that he was lying through his teeth?</p>\\n<p>Or even worse still, how long before he succumbed to his injuries?</p>\\n<p>We had <em>some</em> time, be it a minute or five, but I didn\\u2019t like trusting luck.\\xa0 It was a fickle mistress, whatever that meant.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do we need?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShipman,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne or two adults from the next room, to carry her.\\xa0 The glass cases.\\xa0 I need to get back to the others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll get the adults and Shipman, you do that thing,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat are we doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFishing,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve never gone fishing,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She was breathing hard, but she wasn\\u2019t <em>panting, </em>either.\\xa0 Different means of breathing.\\xa0 \\u201cHarpoon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHook,\\u201d I said, meeting her eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow fun!\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Something to bring up later, if I could figure out how to word it.\\xa0 Yes, this was probably fun for her, and yes, I suspected she was worried for Jamie in her own peculiar way, but the nature and tone of the statement were at odds with the fact that we were in as bad a situation as we\\u2019d ever been.</p>\\n<p><em>Up the stairs, to where the others are.</em></p>\\n<p>My legs felt like lead.\\xa0 I doubted I had another run in me.</p>\\n<p>This would have to be the final confrontation.\\xa0 All or nothing.\\xa0 If we screwed up on any level or if something went too wrong, there would be no more tools left to play.</p>\\n<p>We reached the others.\\xa0 I pulled ahead of Helen, pounding on the door that hid the adults as I passed it.\\xa0 I tried to give it a cadence that would sound less like the knock of an immortal abomination of nature and more like something people could open a door for, but I rushed it a bit in the process.</p>\\n<p>I let myself into the room where Lillian, Gordon, Mary and Gladys Shipman were.\\xa0 Quickly, I stopped by each, checking that they were still warm and breathing.</p>\\n<p>Mary was the last.\\xa0 I helped myself to knives, because knives were useful, and then I reached up her skirt and pulled the loop of wire free.</p>\\n<p><em>The fishing line</em>.</p>\\n<p>I could hear Helen outside, talking to the people in the other room.\\xa0 Two words.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease help.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My attention fell on Gladys.</p>\\n<p><em>The bait.</em></p>\\n<p>I bent down and began winding wire around her ankles.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s hand moved.\\xa0 He barely had his eyes open, but he touched my elbow.</p>\\n<p>I kept winding.</p>\\n<p>His touch became a firm grip, hard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie\\u2019s dying,\\u201d I said, very quiet, my voice as firm as his grip.</p>\\n<p>The hand fell away.\\xa0 His eyes were closed, but there was an expression of deep concern on his face.</p>\\n<p>I was still working on the tie of thin wire when Helen came into the room with three of the male scientists.\\xa0 Gladys\\u2019 partner, the older woman, was at the tail end of the group.</p>\\n<p>She saw what I was doing and pushed past the others.\\xa0 I pushed back, hard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo! Whatever you\\u2019re doing-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m stopping that monster and getting every single one of us out of here alive,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p><em>I\\u2019m going to try</em>, I revised my statement in my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe are,\\u201d Helen said, in a very particular voice that was probably modulated and calculated to win the adults over.\\xa0 Confident without being threatening.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease trust us.\\xa0 Do as we say, and we should all get out of here alive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>I</em> almost believed her, before I remembered that she was basing that statement on her belief in <em>me</em>, and I knew I didn\\u2019t have that much trust in me or my own plan.</p>\\n<p>Helen knelt by me, then leaned close, \\u201cIf you do it like that, the wire\\u2019s going to pull taut and cut her to the bone.\\xa0 She\\u2019ll lose her feet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Maybe the blood will help</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey can give her new feet later.\\xa0 There\\u2019s no time,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Jamie was down there, doing everything he could.\\xa0 He was probably dying, he could die if his concentration or consciousness faltered for a moment and he said the wrong thing, or if Sub Rosa figured out he was lying or tired of him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHere,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She took the wire from my hands.\\xa0 \\u201cIbbot hired a trainer to teach me to tie people up properly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy would tying people up be useful?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou tie people up with\\u2026 <em>you</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cI know.\\xa0 I do.\\xa0 It\\u2019s for the end goal.\\xa0 The me I\\u2019m supposed to end up as, a nice skill to have available.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I thought about it.\\xa0 Helen as the dangerous dame, using her attractiveness and appeal as a weapon to get close.\\xa0 I blinked a few times.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow I\\u2019m even <em>less</em> sure why you\\u2019d need to tie someone up,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t answer, as she tugged at the wire, but she leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek, which only confused me more.</p>\\n<p>She slipped few metal tools into the gap between wire and leg so the sharp edge of the wire would press them against Shipman\\u2019s legs rather than cut into flesh.</p>\\n<p>She did the remainder of the tying up and knotting, probably faster in the end than I\\u2019d have been on my own, and the knot looked strong, the extra ropes hooked into, under and around Shipman\\u2019s shoulders and clothing.</p>\\n<p>I gauged the remaining length of the wire.\\xa0 About twenty feet?</p>\\n<p>It would have to do.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCarry her,\\u201d I said, to the adults.</p>\\n<p>One balked.\\xa0 \\u201cHow old are you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m <em>eleven</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAlmost <em>twelve</em>.\\xa0 And we\\u2019ve killed more monsters than you\\u2019re even aware <em>existed</em>.\\xa0 <em>Carry her</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was anxious for Jamie, and my anxiety was transforming into a crazed anger and impatience.\\xa0 If I had to let Gladys Shipman lose her feet or murder one of these idiots as an example to make this work, then I\\u2019d damn well do it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease,\\u201d Helen offered, as an addition to my order.</p>\\n<p>They picked up Shipman.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGloves?\\u201d I asked, looking around\\xa0 \\u201cThick ones\\u2026 they\\u2019ll need <em>something.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t see anything.\\xa0 Fuck it.</p>\\n<p>We walked as a group, me in the lead, Helen a little behind me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going ahead,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou set up at the fourth floor.\\xa0 Use your lab coats or something to protect your hands.\\xa0 Tie the other end to the rail.\\xa0 Lower her down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>What</em>?\\u201d one of the men asked.\\xa0 He was older.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat are you talking about?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSub Rosa only wants a few things.\\xa0 That girl is one of them.\\xa0 Sub Rosa spent a long time tearing down doors and making her way through the Bowels to reach her,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to give her what she wants.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike <em>hell</em> you will,\\u201d the woman said.\\xa0 Gladys Shipman\\u2019s partner.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot in <em>reality</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut we need to position her right, to set the hook.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s stronger than me,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t think I can hold her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t need to hold her for too long,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She took me at my word so easily.\\xa0 Helen wasn\\u2019t, as far as I was aware, possessed of the capacity for frustration or exploration.\\xa0 She had something she was good at, she knew her niche, and she was profoundly comfortable within that niche.\\xa0 Ibbot had done some things right.</p>\\n<p>In the briefest possible terms, she trusted herself, and she trusted me.</p>\\n<p>I trusted her instincts.\\xa0 There were a few ways this could go, which would require far much explanation to cover in detail without confusing matters, and that same explanation would probably upset the natives.</p>\\n<p>We reached the spiral stairs.\\xa0 I grabbed the railing, holding on, and slipped under, leaning over as far as I was able to look down the circular shaft.\\xa0 Gorger was a pale speck down at the bottom, and Sub Rosa was far from a speck, a considerable distance closer.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d left Jamie behind, and she was coming up.</p>\\n<p>I felt a sickness roiling in my stomach, a feeling that refused to clarify itself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGet in position,\\u201d I said, as I moved to do the same.\\xa0 \\u201cLower her when I whistle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I hurried, though my legs were too tired to properly run.</p>\\n<p>Here we were.\\xa0 It was hard to know what to do, if Sub Rosa was even hostile, but the consequences for assuming she wasn\\u2019t hostile and then being wrong\\u2026 I wasn\\u2019t willing to deal with them.</p>\\n<p>One way or another, this was the final confrontation.</p>\\n<p><em>Thanks for buying us time, Jamie</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>I picked up the canister of plague with ginger care.\\xa0 I felt a thrill of power, simply from holding it.</p>\\n<p>In a confidence game, one of the first things to do was to create a sense of urgency.\\xa0 The second thing to do was to put the other party off balance.\\xa0 Clever men who made their illicit living manipulating others didn\\u2019t tend to do it while keeping their targets clear headed and focused.</p>\\n<p>I sat down, then lay back, and flipped over until I was on my belly, before creeping forward, looking through the supports for the railing and down.</p>\\n<p>When Sub Rosa was directly beneath me, I threw the canister down at an angle, so it would hit the wall just above her.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t break on the initial contact, but it hit the stairs and cracked.</p>\\n<p>The pressurized contents exploded into a cloud far, far larger than I\\u2019d expected.\\xa0 I scrambled to get up and back.</p>\\n<p>I had to hope it wouldn\\u2019t reach Jamie, who was a few floors down.\\xa0 There were the people on the ground floor too, but <em>Jamie</em>.</p>\\n<p>I <em>really</em> hoped none of the wall crawlers appeared.\\xa0 I was vulnerable like this.\\xa0 They couldn\\u2019t kill me, but they could distract at a critical moment.</p>\\n<p>The cloud stopped billowing out.\\xa0 With all her injuries, Sub Rosa probably wouldn\\u2019t like it, though it might not take effect immediately.</p>\\n<p><em>That\\u2019s for hurting him</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>I headed further up the stairs.\\xa0 I grabbed the thing with water inside, then advanced back down a little, watching and waiting.\\xa0 Better to have another canister behind me if I needed to make a run for it.</p>\\n<p>If she went down, I could hopefully disturb her with this.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t know it was harmless, for one thing, and she didn\\u2019t know I only had the three.</p>\\n<p>With luck, I could convince her that the only way to deal with the problem was to come\\xa0 up.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t go down.\\xa0 She emerged from one end of the red-brown cloud, rubbing at her eye, snorting to breathe through her nose.</p>\\n<p>She managed to clear her vision enough to make me out, a full floor above her, and picked up her pace.</p>\\n<p>If she came <em>up</em>, angry and ready to kill, I had an option for that as well.</p>\\n<p>I threw the canister with the compressed water vapor inside, aiming for it to land between us, closer to me than to her.</p>\\n<p>Like the last, it cracked and released its contents, with glass flying everywhere, before a thick mist enveloped that part of the stairwell.</p>\\n<p>I saw Sub Rosa back out of the lower end of the cloud.</p>\\n<p><em>Can\\u2019t charge ahead recklessly, can\\u2019t ignore me.\\xa0 Do what you\\u2019re so good at doing.\\xa0 The steady and implacable advance</em>.</p>\\n<p>I turned and\\xa0 retreated further, to the entrance to the fifth floor hallway, where the last vial was.</p>\\n<p>This was more defensive than offensive.</p>\\n<p>I had to wait for the mist to clear.\\xa0 My heart was beating so hard in my chest I thought I might throw up because of it.</p>\\n<p><em>Come on.\\xa0 Come on</em>.</p>\\n<p>It took time for the mist to clear.\\xa0 I fidgeted, waiting.</p>\\n<p>When it had mostly cleared, Sub Rosa forged ahead, wiping again at her eyes and nose.\\xa0 The edges looked red and inflamed.</p>\\n<p>I whistled, still considering everything I needed to do.\\xa0 If Sub Rosa came for me\\u2026</p>\\n<p>I picked up the last glass container.\\xa0 My just-in-case measure.</p>\\n<p>Dangling from her ankles, Shipman was lowered into view.\\xa0 I saw Sub Rosa crane her neck to look up and see.\\xa0 I noticed how she picked up the pace.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa came up, Shipman was lowered down, and I waited, tense.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s deal,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cWe want to live, you want revenge.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t need to be able to <em>talk</em> to make this deal.\\xa0 It\\u2019s as simple as these things get.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRevenge?\\u201d I heard one of the adults above asking.\\xa0 They\\u2019d heard.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa continued her advance, not stopping.\\xa0 I tightened my grip on the glass canister and backed up a step.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you come after me,\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t get her.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll drop her.\\xa0 She dies, never the wiser.\\xa0 Hardly a revenge against anyone who did this to you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She slowed a touch.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe <em>knew</em>,\\u201d I lied.\\xa0 \\u201cShe was there.\\xa0 She knew what you were.\\xa0 You saw the recognition in her eyes when you saw her on the sixth floor.\\xa0 It would be ridiculous to think she wouldn\\u2019t know, with her uncle working down here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa looked at Shipman, who wasn\\u2019t being lowered anymore.</p>\\n<p>Were the adults too busy fighting and arguing?</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d <em>told</em> them all they had to do was follow orders.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe told me those things about you.\\xa0 She was one of many who\\u2019ve taken your legacy and twisted it into something ugly.\\xa0 Lies, and untruths.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>But Shipman was several feet out of reach, dangling, skirt closer to her ribcage than her knees, and I, unfortunately, was closer.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa drew nearer.</p>\\n<p><em>Damn it.\\xa0</em></p>\\n<p>I raised the glass canister over my head.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa lunged forward, fast and hard enough that she couldn\\u2019t <em>aim</em>, and tapped me in the ribs with the spike.</p>\\n<p>My knees went out from under me as the shock rippled through me.\\xa0 The glass canister slipped from my grip a moment too late, falling in the wrong direction, hitting the stairs above me.</p>\\n<p><em>No</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>No.</em></p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d hoped to use the cloud of mist to beat a retreat, either into the hallway or up the stairs.\\xa0 Let Sub Rosa have only Shipman in reach when the mist cleared.</p>\\n<p>But now I was at her mercy.</p>\\n<p>My breath caught as I tried to bring it into my lungs.\\xa0 When I finally found air, I screamed, \\u201cLower her!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBarely any wire left!\\u201d I heard back.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa stared down at me, her one visible eye clear.\\xa0 A thick rash had already spread over her exposed skin.</p>\\n<p>The look in her eyes was a sad one, which caught me off guard.</p>\\n<p>On the other hand, her fist was clenched, her hand shaking.</p>\\n<p>Not enough mercy in her to spare me, not enough anger in her for her to go straight after Shipman.</p>\\n<p>I stood to be a casualty of the middle ground.</p>\\n<p>Shipman suddenly dropped another three feet.\\xa0 The movement caught Sub Rosa\\u2019s eye.</p>\\n<p>The woman looked away from me, the spike pointed in my general direction.</p>\\n<p>She walked over to the railing, leaning forward and reaching up and out to seize Shipman by the collar.\\xa0 She tugged, hard, and Shipman came free entirely, the wire from the grip or tie or whatever they\\u2019d done up above.</p>\\n<p>Hopefully Helen wasn\\u2019t too busy lowering Shipman to-</p>\\n<p>No.\\xa0 Helen wasn\\u2019t too busy.\\xa0 She appeared, hair and skirt fluttering as she dropped from the stairwell above, seizing Sub Rosa\\u2019s reaching arm and Shipman both.</p>\\n<p>My heart leaped.\\xa0 This hadn\\u2019t <em>quite</em> been the plan.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was strong, but leverage was leverage.\\xa0 Helen had to weigh about seven stone.\\xa0 Gladys maybe eight.\\xa0 Both weights tugged down on Sub Rosa\\u2019s arm as she was reaching over the rail.</p>\\n<p>The top end of her went down, the other end went up and over the railing.</p>\\n<p>I found my faculties, and half-crawled, half-walked over to the ledge, praying that I wasn\\u2019t going to find out that I\\u2019d lost Jamie and Helen in the same day.</p>\\n<p>Staring down, I saw Helen another floor down.</p>\\n<p>If I or another human being had reached out and grabbed the railing after falling nearly thirty feet, I might have lost my fingers or my arm.\\xa0 But Helen was built differently.\\xa0 She hung there, her arm a few feet longer than it should\\u2019ve been, a limp Gladys Shipman dangling from her other hand.</p>\\n<p>At the bottom of the shaft was a dark blot that marked where Sub Rosa had hit ground.\\xa0 The pale blob that was Gorger inched forward, until it reached her, and then consumed its meal.</p>\\n<p>Helen had made it.\\xa0 Shipman too, maybe.\\xa0 Sub Rosa was gone.</p>\\n<p>I wasted no time in heading to Jamie\\u2019s side.</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/05/30/lips-sealed-3-5/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>I tapped the handle of the knife against the side of my leg as I walked, the flat of the blade pressed against my wrist.</p>\\n<p>People were about to die.\\xa0 Depending on how this played out, those people could include <em>us</em>.</p>\\n<p>As experiments, we\\u2019d been subjected to all kinds of testing.\\xa0 Most of the time, the testing was specific to us and our individual situations.\\xa0 Helen had started out doing a lot of tests that involved passing muster among her supposed peers, while I\\u2019d been tasked with studying up new tasks and long, painful sets of memory games.</p>\\n<p>One of the tests, however, was one that involved all of us, probably because Hayle liked it, and because he was interested in how we functioned as a group.\\xa0 Each of us were given a set of choices to make, selfish and kind.\\xa0 He mixed it up, added new rules, and organized us into teams, pitting us against regular students.\\xa0 The dilemma was simple, usually.\\xa0 If both parties were kind, both received a minor benefit.\\xa0 If both were selfish, both were punished.\\xa0 If one was kind and the other selfish, the selfish one was rewarded, the kind one punished.</p>\\n<p>It stuck in my mind because it was, for me, the circumstance of my meeting Gordon and Helen, taking a seat across the table from them, with Hayle introducing us.\\xa0 Curiosity had won out and I\\u2019d gone to find and meet Jamie on my own, which had been a lifesaver in many respects.</p>\\n<p>But that wasn\\u2019t my focus right now.\\xa0 It came down to the <em>game</em>.\\xa0 Sometimes we\\u2019d played and we\\u2019d been allowed to communicate.\\xa0 Sometimes we\\u2019d been silenced and forced to communicate through decisions alone.\\xa0 There was even a point in time where we\\u2019d played with territories and quadrants, and I\\u2019d been the only one silenced, because Hayle was tired of me skewing his results by winning as often as I was.</p>\\n<p>Right this moment, we were playing the game.</p>\\n<p>The convict leader walked beside me, periodically giving me curious looks.\\xa0 He was a sadist of the worst sort, and his innate savagery had been given an almost desperate edge.\\xa0 He ruled by fear.\\xa0 A simple show of strength could inspire that fear and cow others, but he\\u2019d spent some time in prison, he\\u2019d spent some time with his fellow experiments, and at some point he must have realized that others were just as strong as him.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes people found a kind of uneasy peace with that kind of power.\\xa0 If everyone had a gun, cocked and aimed at the next guy, nobody was willing to shoot.\\xa0 That went for prison muscle and voltaic spikes sticking out of people\\u2019s hands.</p>\\n<p>This was a guy who hadn\\u2019t backed down or found that uneasy peace.\\xa0 He\\u2019d learned that when everyone else was hitting as hard as he was, he could still scare people by twisting the knife, maybe being a little crazy or a little scary.</p>\\n<p>No guarantees about particulars, of course, but in terms of drawing up a mental picture of who he was and how he operated, it served.\\xa0 I knew what things I had to watch out for, and foremost among those things was the notion that this was a man who asserted control through fear and pain, and with more than a few ongoing mysteries at present, myself included, he might be feeling a little out of control.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d put myself within arm\\u2019s reach of him.\\xa0 I was walking in step with him.</p>\\n<p>He moved the spike in my direction.\\xa0 I watched it, but didn\\u2019t flinch.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat makes you think I\\u2019m going to let you do anything?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll do it because you want to see what I can do,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I wiped at the blood on my lower face, doing my best to get as much off my face as possible.\\xa0 It hurt, but I didn\\u2019t let the pain show.\\xa0 I left the blood cupped in the palm of my hand.\\xa0 I still had the knife palmed in my other hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat so?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I picked up the pace, moving ahead of the convict leader.\\xa0 <em>And you\\u2019ll do it because you probably feel insecure letting the other three out of your sight.\\xa0 Like I did with Mary.</em></p>\\n<p>I reached the door.\\xa0 It was a large piece of metal work, thick, with a slot halfway down for paperwork.\\xa0 Whatever was inside wasn\\u2019t big enough to escape through the slot.\\xa0 Still, it was very nearly as secure as the doors that separated the sections here.</p>\\n<p>I stopped, paused, and then knocked.\\xa0 <em>Shave and a haircut, two pence.</em></p>\\n<p>No response.\\xa0 Something moved within, rummaging.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t hear words, which meant it was only one person.\\xa0 Probably.</p>\\n<p><em>Probably heard the screaming just down the hall</em>.</p>\\n<p>With two clean fingers, blood still mostly on my palm, I plucked the badge from under my pocket.\\xa0 I passed it through the slot for the papers, and it dropped a short distance before clinking landing in the tray on the far side.</p>\\n<p>The simplest answer was often the best.</p>\\n<p>The door opened a crack.\\xa0 The person on the other side took a second to look <em>down</em> enough to see me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcuse me,\\u201d I said, pushing on the door.\\xa0 They resisted for a moment, then grudgingly let the door open.\\xa0 Which was good.\\xa0 If the convict standing behind me had felt the need to push his way through, I wasn\\u2019t sure I could have stopped his forward momentum.</p>\\n<p>The man who looked down at me was thirty or so, hair cut short, beard longer, trimmed into a point at the chin, his mustache styled.\\xa0 His white coat was pristine.\\xa0 No doubt one of several.</p>\\n<p>He was new to this, no doubt new to this sixth floor lab within the Bowels.</p>\\n<p>His experiment was still in an early stage, within a heated incubator at one side of the room, sealed off behind jail doors and glass panes.</p>\\n<p><em>And here is where the game comes to a head.\\xa0 The others are in other rooms, facing similar situations.\\xa0 Convicts nearby, scientists and scholars in the rooms, and between Sub Rosa\\u2019s vague instructions and the convict leader\\u2019s example, the other thugs are going to want to kill other scientists</em>.</p>\\n<p>The choice between selfish and kind.\\xa0 If I killed the scientist and the others killed the convicts in other rooms, I\\u2019d have a crazy bastard at my back who\\u2019d want to put me down the moment he realized what was going on.\\xa0 If I killed the convict and the others killed scholars, they\\u2019d be at risk.\\xa0 There were so many variables to take into account.\\xa0 How capable were they of doing one thing or the other?</p>\\n<p>The trick with Hayle\\u2019s game, the reason I\\u2019d been able to win so consistently, was that the game was never a standalone thing.\\xa0 There were a hundred or a thousand clues communicated over past iterations of the game, informing the most current game.</p>\\n<p>It was these clues I relied on now.\\xa0 I could trust Gordon and Helen to match pace with me.\\xa0 We\\u2019d faced Hayle\\u2019s test enough times as a group to know how each of us thought.\\xa0 Jamie could remember the results of each game he\\u2019d participated in, and that would inform his decision.\\xa0 I trusted him more than anyone.</p>\\n<p>The real question, the test of our group cohesion, was, well, what choice would Lillian make, and what choice would Mary make?</p>\\n<p>Lillian was kind, a healer more than a killer.\\xa0 Mary was the opposite, though she wasn\\u2019t <em>unkind</em>, exactly.</p>\\n<p>I had to figure out which decision they\\u2019d make, and I had to figure out what decision Gordon, Helen, and Jamie would think those two would make.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to kill you now,\\u201d I told him, giving him a very pointed, obvious wink.\\xa0 With my back to the convict, I kept my hand and the knife in front of me, and scraped up the blood with the blade.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh?\\xa0 What?\\u201d the man asked.\\xa0 Then, in a tone more suited to rebuking a very small child for stealing candy from a store, he told me, \\u201cNo!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can do this the easy way or the hard way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the difference?\\xa0 What are you even talking about?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHard way it is,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Holding the knife upside-down, I punched the butt-end of it into his nether regions.</p>\\n<p>Most available, vulnerable spot, given the difference in height.</p>\\n<p>He made a strangled noise, then fell to the ground.</p>\\n<p>I turned on the spot, flipping the dagger over, and showed the convict leader the knife that was smeared with the blood from my hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCut it at the root,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I gave the convict leader a wide smile.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s going to bleed out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The convict leader didn\\u2019t look impressed.\\xa0 \\u201cThese doctors are good at patching themselves up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood point!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Upbeat, chipper, still channeling Helen.\\xa0 \\u201cHelp me.\\xa0 Stand on his hands?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re giving me <em>orders</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019ll be fun!\\u201d I said, smiling, holding the knife up.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d the man managed to speak.\\xa0 Every syllable was colored with pain.\\xa0 \\u201cOhhh, it hurts so much.\\xa0 Please!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The convict approached. He stepped on the man\\u2019s hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait, no, on his wrists,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The convict leader gave me a dirty look.</p>\\n<p>I waited patiently, keeping the same dead-eyed smile on my face.</p>\\n<p>He shifted his footing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d the man on the floor moaned.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I bent down, closer to his head.\\xa0 I was stopped by the point of the skewer, an inch away from my neck.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLose the knife,\\u201d the convict said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t want you getting close to me like that, after what you did to him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Keeping the knife would have been better.\\xa0 I tossed the knife off to one side, at the desk.\\xa0 It clattered onto the wooden desktop.</p>\\n<p>Disappointing.\\xa0 I\\u2019d hoped it would land point first.\\xa0 Would have been so damn cool, just casually throwing it like that and having it <em>stick</em>.</p>\\n<p>I bent down just behind the convict.\\xa0 I grabbed one of the scholar\\u2019s fingers in both hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease.\\xa0 What\\u2019s going on?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI severed something important between your legs,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cNow\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I bent the finger back until something gave.</p>\\n<p>He screamed, thrashed and howled as much as he was able to without moving his legs all that much.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026I\\u2019m making sure you can\\u2019t fix it,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>The convict leader let out a light chuckle at that, looking down at me over one shoulder.</p>\\n<p>I repeated the process with each finger, faster now.\\xa0 Each one brought fresh screams.</p>\\n<p>My heart was pounding, but it had nothing to do with what was going on in this room.\\xa0 What were the others doing?</p>\\n<p>What was <em>Sub Rosa</em> doing, even?</p>\\n<p>There were so many factors to consider, too many people in play, too many unknowns.</p>\\n<p>Even on my own team, I wasn\\u2019t a hundred percent sure I could predict Lillian or Mary.\\xa0 After today, after I saw the decisions Lillian made on what she\\u2019d admitted was her worst day, I might have a better idea.\\xa0 Mary, I couldn\\u2019t decide on until I\\u2019d seen her on her best day, whether that day was the day she finally had a family or the day Percy came back for her.</p>\\n<p>I broke the last of the fingers, leaving each one curved in the wrong direction, then stood.\\xa0 The convict leader released the man\\u2019s wrists and stepped back to admire my handiwork, while the man writhed belly-down on the floor.</p>\\n<p>I crossed the room to go collect the knife, then sauntered over to the fallen man, hand and knife behind my back.\\xa0 I sliced my own palm, at the base, suppressing a flinch, then worked my thumb into the wound, opening it up.</p>\\n<p>The more blood, the better.</p>\\n<p>The rest was posing and posturing.\\xa0 I was fortunate, in a way, that the convict leader\\u2019s attention was on the back of the door.\\xa0 The mail slot.\\xa0 He had the badge.</p>\\n<p>I knelt between the legs of the man I\\u2019d maimed, and used my bloody hand to grip his bits.</p>\\n<p><em>I look forward to being taller than five feet, so I\\u2019m not limited to going after the balls all the time.</em></p>\\n<p>He yelped in pain, and the convict leader looked my way.</p>\\n<p>When I raised my hand, it was covered in blood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to bleed out, sir,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t do anything to stop it, now, it\\u2019s just a matter of time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t understand,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could have made this a <em>lot</em> worse.\\xa0 I\\u2019m betting <em>he</em> would have put the skewers through you in two different directions and tried to make the points touch.\\xa0 All I did was cut you,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>I gave him a kick in the side for good measure.\\xa0 He grunted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou get me?\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr do I have to show you how mean I can <em>really</em> get?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t understand,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He was panicking a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank me,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cThank me for <em>going easy</em> on you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t-\\xa0 Thank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p>Then I kicked him again for good measure.</p>\\n<p>I walked over to the door.</p>\\n<p>The convict leader looked more wary than ever.\\xa0 Had I pushed things too far?\\xa0 Left him confused enough that he\\u2019d try simplifying his life by removing me from the equation?</p>\\n<p>I had to put myself on his terms more.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid I do good?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 A child looking for a parent\\u2019s praise.</p>\\n<p>His brow knit in a frown.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this?\\u201d\\xa0 He asked me, showing me the badge.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBefore she let you out, she let us out,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cGot that from the guy who was in charge of our experiment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I plucked at my uniform shirt.\\xa0 \\u201cWe got <em>these </em>from some kids who were wandering around.\\xa0 Mine doesn\\u2019t really fit, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d he said, taking it in.</p>\\n<p>Were the pieces falling in place, or was he contemplating how to deal with me?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like you,\\u201d he decided.</p>\\n<p>I grinned, a genuine smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cMore witnesses to remove.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart sank a little.</p>\\n<p>While fine, this situation being something I could work with, each room we cleared out was another chance for things to go wrong.</p>\\n<p>Doubly so when the others were off on other branches of this floor, and we were engaged in our game, our merry dance where coordination was so vital.</p>\\n<p>I slammed the door closed behind me as we returned to the hallway.\\xa0 The man would hurt, his balls might swell, his fingers would take some time to fix, but he would live.</p>\\n<p>I walked with one hand in a pocket, knowing that bloodstains were spreading through white fabric, but I had to staunch the minor flow of blood, and pressing it into my hip was the only available option that wouldn\\u2019t attract too much attention.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBadge,\\u201d I said, reaching up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m wearing a uniform.\\xa0 I can use it better,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I\\u2019m going to hold onto it, I think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Damn him.</p>\\n<p>That was <em>my</em> badge.</p>\\n<p>I contemplated killing him and letting the game be damned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said, smiling, stowing the dark resentment and anger deep inside.</p>\\n<p>We reached the next door.\\xa0 <em>This</em> one lacking a slot for files and mail.\\xa0 We didn\\u2019t get far enough to do anything with it.\\xa0 My head turned as shouts came from the far end of the hallway.</p>\\n<p><em>The others</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>Did we misstep?\\xa0 </em></p>\\n<p><em>Lillian.</em></p>\\n<p>The convict headed that way.\\xa0 I did too, but where he started off walking at a brisk pace, I broke out into a run.</p>\\n<p>If this went sour, then I wanted enough space between him and me.\\xa0 I needed to be able to act, speak, do <em>something.\\xa0 </em>It wouldn\\u2019t do if he could simply assess the situation and then murder me in the next moment.</p>\\n<p>My head was a storm of possibilities and half-formed plans.\\xa0 I swapped the knife over to my right hand, with the cut at the base of my palm, and held it with the blade between the index and middle finger, handle gripped hard against the cut.</p>\\n<p><em>What do we do?</em></p>\\n<p><em>How do we tackle this?</em></p>\\n<p><em>I need more information!</em></p>\\n<p>In the end, it wasn\\u2019t Lillian.</p>\\n<p>Mary was backed up against the wall, chin raised.\\xa0 Baldy-beardy had his spike at the base of her chin, ready to penetrate the part just below the bone.</p>\\n<p>The other convicts were alive.\\xa0 The woman, shaggy-beardy, and the older man.\\xa0 They stood back, keeping the other Lambs from rushing to Mary\\u2019s rescue.</p>\\n<p>Passing the junction in the hallway where Sub Rosa was, I could see that she was <em>still</em> working through the wiring and protections.\\xa0 Whatever was beyond warranted steeper protection.</p>\\n<p>I got closer, and the woman with the spikes at her hand pointed her other spike at me, stopping me from advancing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat the <em>hell</em> are you doing?\\u201d the convict leader asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis little bitch just tried to stab me in the back!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Come on, Mary</em>, I thought.\\xa0 I felt genuinely disappointed.\\xa0 <em>Did you really think I have the ability to surprise and murder the convicts\\u2019 leader in a brawl?\\xa0 What did you think the next step was?\\xa0 Were we going to go with Sub Rosa and expect her not to notice that her pet convicts weren\\u2019t coming with?</em></p>\\n<p>Worst of all, I could see it on her face.\\xa0 That she <em>knew</em> I was disappointed.\\xa0 That she\\u2019d been tested, and she\\u2019d failed.\\xa0 Under the pressure, she\\u2019d defaulted to doing what she\\u2019d been <em>created</em> to do.</p>\\n<p>Mary <em>hated</em> failing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat so,\\u201d the convict leader said.\\xa0 He gave me a <em>look</em>.\\xa0 \\u201cThat so?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFreak of nature is still working on the door,\\u201d the convict leader said.\\xa0 \\u201cKill the little bitch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo it,\\u201d the convict leader said.</p>\\n<p>Baldy-beardy stabbed, but Mary slipped to one side in the same moment, and the spike only touched the side of her neck.\\xa0 She flinched, strength momentarily going out of her as though she were a marionette with the strings severed.\\xa0 As the spike moved to follow her as she tumbled toward the ground, she put her hands out.\\xa0 Something made a sound, a hard object striking the metal, and the spike was knocked aside.\\xa0 Something in her sleeves that didn\\u2019t conduct.</p>\\n<p>She landed on her back, beside the wall.\\xa0 Convicts with Academy augmentations in front and to either side of her.</p>\\n<p>She was quick, trained, and she clearly had something in mind, but even in this situation, there wasn\\u2019t a lot she could do.</p>\\n<p>But there was an advantage to the fact that she was surrounded.\\xa0 There was a pause as each of the three convicts worked to figure out who would deliver the final blow.</p>\\n<p>I saw Gordon tense.\\xa0 He had an avenue for attack here.\\xa0 He met my eyes, and I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s a mad dog,\\u201d I said, in the most casual tone I could manage.</p>\\n<p>The final blow was delayed another moment.</p>\\n<p>I was doing my utmost to avoid rushing my words.\\xa0 If I wanted them to listen, to <em>stop</em> and listen, even, I needed to phrase things carefully.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s the most complete of any of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cComplete?\\xa0 What the hell are you saying?\\u201d the leader asked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy are you even listening to the little fuckspittle?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Sh</em>,\\u201d the leader answered, a short, sharp sound.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cComplete.\\xa0 They wanted to make us all like <em>her</em>.\\xa0 Killers.\\xa0 I think they did too good a job with her.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not her fault.\\xa0 Just have to keep her on a leash,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Fuck</em> leashes,\\u201d the man Mary had tried to kill spat the words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKillers,\\u201d the leader mused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnes you wouldn\\u2019t expect,\\u201d I said, quiet, giving him my best deadpan stare.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd right now, we\\u2019re just killers who want to hurt the Academy.\\xa0 Your buddy there probably did something like get in between Mary and her prey.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d the leader said, but it was a sound that didn\\u2019t come across as particularly convinced.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFrom what I saw of those two,\\u201d the older man said, indicating Gordon and Helen, \\u201cMakes a lot of sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d played along.\\xa0 Chances were good the people they\\u2019d \\u2018killed\\u2019 were alive, like the one I\\u2019d gone after.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d the leader said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLittle girl here didn\\u2019t do much,\\u201d shaggy-beardy said, indicating Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201cWatched while I took a roomful of people to pieces.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBoy,\\u201d Jamie said, staring the man down through his own long hair. \\u201cI\\u2019m a boy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever.\\xa0 You didn\\u2019t come off like some special killer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Damn it,</em> I thought.\\xa0 Not that I was too surprised.\\xa0 Jamie was slow to act when caught off guard.\\xa0 Devising a plan for faking someone\\u2019s murder was hard enough.\\xa0 Doing it off the cuff was harder still.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s not as far along,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s this one too,\\u201d the woman said, looking Lillian\\u2019s way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s even less far along,\\u201d I jumped in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPut ten kinds of needles in people in that room over there,\\u201d the convict woman said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne was foaming at the mouth.\\xa0 It was\\u2026 something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The convict woman wasn\\u2019t so bloodthirsty, it seemed.\\xa0 Angry, yes, but not bloodthirsty.</p>\\n<p>I met Lillian\\u2019s eyes.</p>\\n<p>She looked scared.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t clever or controlled enough to hide that.</p>\\n<p>But she\\u2019d done it.\\xa0 She\\u2019d danced the dance, played the game, and she\\u2019d done it even without the benefit of playing a hundred rounds of Hayle\\u2019s game with the rest of us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou take that girl,\\u201d the leader told me, pointing at Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cYou <em>watch</em> her.\\xa0 If that rabid dog of yours pulls another stunt, I\\u2019m finishing off the <em>both</em> of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He jabbed the spike toward my eye.\\xa0 It took more than willpower to avoid flinching.\\xa0 I had to trick my senses, change my perception of what the spike was, so I wouldn\\u2019t flinch instinctively.</p>\\n<p>Only a gesture.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re letting her live?\\xa0 She tried to put a knife between my ribs!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m fucking letting her live!\\u201d the leader said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re <em>arguing</em> with me?\\xa0 I like this little fuck, I want to see what else he\\u2019s capable of.\\xa0 If this fucking place created him and he wants to get them back, I want to see it happen!\\xa0 Do you <em>really</em> want to say otherwise?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Baldy-beardy scowled, but didn\\u2019t open his mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll hear you out if you want to say something contrary!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Baldy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\xa0 You sure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sure, yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d the leader said.\\xa0 \\u201cSure hope you are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>While they were talking, I walked over to Mary.\\xa0 I gave her my hand.\\xa0 She used it to stand.</p>\\n<p>I could see the hurt in her eyes, the anger that was directed at herself more than anything.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot all the rooms here?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>There were nods.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s a few more that way,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ll get \\u2019em.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The convict leader glanced at me, unhappy with my initiative, but he gave me a nod.</p>\\n<p>I was his buddy now.\\xa0 He liked me, and I doubted he liked any of the other members of his little gang.</p>\\n<p>Letting me do this, giving the go-ahead, it was a way of asserting his authority in an odd way.</p>\\n<p>We left the convicts behind.\\xa0 We passed by the door that Sub Rosa was still working on.\\xa0 She hadn\\u2019t even started prying at it.\\xa0 She was elbow deep in mechanisms at the frame.</p>\\n<p>We headed down the hall in the direction the leader and I had gone.\\xa0 Two rooms.\\xa0 I tried to hold Mary\\u2019s hand, and she pulled away from me.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t dare meet the eyes of the others or try to say something.\\xa0 The convicts were watching.\\xa0 We had one ally among them, the most important one, but I didn\\u2019t want to foster any doubt.</p>\\n<p>Two doors.\\xa0 One without a slot, the other with.</p>\\n<p>I knocked on the one without a slot.\\xa0 I heard a murmur of a response.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJo Anna Kelper,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet us in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was the sound of a lock.\\xa0 The door opened.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>You,</em>\\u201d the woman in the lab coat said.\\xa0 She was older.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour life is in danger,\\u201d Gordon said, flashing the badge.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to fake your death.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She frowned.</p>\\n<p>Lillian held up a syringe.\\xa0 \\u201cTranquilizer.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll also slow your system.\\xa0 Induced hibernation state.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m old, I might not wake up from something like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t do something like this, those guys down the hall will make sure you don\\u2019t wake up at all,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Jo Anna frowned, then nodded.</p>\\n<p>Lillian administered the dose.</p>\\n<p>It was only after the syringe was emptied into Jo Anna\\u2019s arm that Lillian gave another syringe.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis will make her seize up,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot fun, but it\\u2019s ugly to look at, and they\\u2019ll think she\\u2019s dying, even as they don\\u2019t sense much of a heartbeat or breathing.\\xa0 Turn her on her side.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We did.</p>\\n<p>Sure enough, the old woman in the lab coat started having fits a couple of seconds after the dose was administered.</p>\\n<p>We started to vacate the room, and I glanced at Mary, who was standing watch in the hallway, jaw set, an angry look in her eyes.</p>\\n<p>People were so hard to manage.</p>\\n<p>Mary wasn\\u2019t the entirety of the group.\\xa0 I looked at Lillian.</p>\\n<p>My hand found hers.\\xa0 I gave it a squeeze.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t give me that shocked look you give me every time I\\u2019m not mean to you,\\u201d I murmured, my head tilted to be closer to her ear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you up to?\\u201d she hissed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight now, I\\u2019m saying you did a fantastic job,\\u201d I whispered.\\xa0 \\u201cYou came across like a true Lamb.\\xa0 <em>Good work.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t react to that.\\xa0 We made our way out into the hallway, and she tugged her hand from mine.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m waiting for the other shoe to drop.\\xa0 You get your kicks by being all nice-nice and then the moment I let my guard down, you kick me in the shins or something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo kick, no shins,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI meant what I said.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I left her with those words.\\xa0 She stared at me as I went over to Mary.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t holding my hand, so I bumped her shoulder with mine.\\xa0 She gave me an annoyed look.</p>\\n<p>Still, she didn\\u2019t outright murder me when I put an arm around her shoulders.</p>\\n<p>Last door.</p>\\n<p>In the absence of my badge, I plucked the one from Mary\\u2019s uniform jacket pocket and put it in the mail slot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe got company,\\u201d Gordon observed.</p>\\n<p>Damn.\\xa0 It couldn\\u2019t be easy.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was on her way, and the convicts were behind her.</p>\\n<p>The door opened just as Sub Rosa arrived.</p>\\n<p>The man on the other side, skinny with circular glasses, dark circles under his eyes and tufty hair at the top of his head, let his mouth go agape, his eyes widening.</p>\\n<p><em>Recognition.\\xa0 Answers.\\xa0 Yes!</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re-\\u201d he started.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa reached out and grabbed his head.</p>\\n<p>It took her relatively little effort to crush his skull with the one hand.\\xa0 Once the bone gave way, the rest followed fairly quickly after.</p>\\n<p><em>My answers!\\xa0 No!</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoor\\u2019s open,\\u201d my new buddy the leader told me.\\xa0 \\u201cShe apparently wants us with.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa shook the bits of scientist-head off her hands, turned, and started her way toward the door.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t look at Jamie, but I knew that he\\u2019d be staring at me, <em>willing</em> me to remember that the daughter of the man who had created Sub Rosa was on the other side.</p>\\n<p>More importantly, the last easy chance we had to get <em>answers</em> was on the other side.</p>\\n<p>Question was, how did we get the girl out alive?</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/06/02/lips-sealed-3-6/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>Convicts, as it happened, smelled.\\xa0 Problem was, I was now the convict leader\\u2019s new best friend, and he was staying close to me.</p>\\n<p>It had its benefits and drawbacks.\\xa0 For one thing, so long as I kept Mary close, it meant our new benefactor was protecting her.\\xa0 For another, it meant I didn\\u2019t have a great range of movement.\\xa0 He was keeping me close, he was <em>talking</em> to me, and I couldn\\u2019t wander off and try to get ahead of Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>On the plus side, we had a few minutes.\\xa0 The Bowels were built around a cylindrical shaft, a few hundred feet deep, two-dozen feet wide.\\xa0 The hallway here extended in a semicircle around to the far side of the shaft.\\xa0 Extra protection, extra thickness, and more room for someone to pull a lever or seal off the area.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa had to stop to work with another panel in the wall.\\xa0 It gave me a second to think.</p>\\n<p>My new buddy elected to distract me, instead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was a skinny little fuck like you, once,\\u201d he told me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReally?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked, more to be polite than anything else.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBad combination, being tall and scrawny.\\xa0 Tried to eat and even did some farm work when I coulda done something else, just to bulk up.\\xa0 But all the energy went to making me taller.\\xa0 A lot of people learn they can make themselves look better by messing with someone taller than them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGotta hurt them bad enough they don\\u2019t try it again,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cSomething like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa resumed walking, another set of safeguards effectively cut off and removed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that how you wound up in prison?\\xa0 Because you hurt someone?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh?\\xa0 Eh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEh,\\u201d I echoed him, acting disinterested.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas a woman.\\xa0 Around the time I started being able to fight back if someone messed with me, I was working on a factory floor, went out for drinks.\\xa0 Guy picked a fight with me to impress his woman, I won, I took my prize.\\xa0 <em>Spectacular</em> piece of work, and at the start, that was only in the best way\\u2026 but I don\\u2019t suppose you get that sort of thing, young as you are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do.\\xa0 I get it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I realized I sounded a little defensive, then said, \\u201cI spend a lot of time with these girls.\\xa0 They\\u2019re pretty.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, Sy,\\u201d Helen said, brightly, from the tail end of the group.</p>\\n<p>Mary gave me a look I couldn\\u2019t read.</p>\\n<p>He gave me a condescending look, and I mused about possibly sticking him with my knife.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, good for you,\\u201d he said, sounding very unimpressed.\\xa0 \\u201cMy girl was top notch, as girls go.\\xa0 Raised the standard for womenfolk everywhere.\\xa0 But she wanted a bad boy and didn\\u2019t realize it.\\xa0 She\\u2019d yelp at me and growl at me for most everything I did, for drinking, for being rough, she\\u2019d get fed up, run away, and she expected me to chase her, tell her I was sorry, that I was reforming my ways.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 I told her straight-up who I was, how I was.\\xa0 If she didn\\u2019t want me, she could go, and she did\\u2026 except she kept coming back.\\xa0 Hoity-toity dad, y\\u2019know?\\xa0 Rich, laid down the law with her, so she\\u2019d run off to slum it with me.\\xa0 Decided she didn\\u2019t like me, went back home.\\xa0 Would\\u2019ve been annoying, but oh, she was gorgeous, and when she came running back, <em>hungry</em> for me\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He paused, looking down at me.\\xa0 I met his gaze.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI figured it would do.\\xa0 She decided otherwise.\\xa0 One night, she ran off home to her daddy, only she told tales.\\xa0 Charges laid against me for shit I didn\\u2019t probably do.\\xa0 Old man even pulled strings, I\\u2019m betting.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t spend more than a year in prison before I got brought <em>here</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you think you\\u2019ll do to him when you get out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gave me a funny look.\\xa0 \\u201cOut?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOut.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI gave up on getting out a while ago,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t lie to me.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t lie to yourself.\\xa0 This is where we live out the rest of our very short lives before we die.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I glanced up at him.\\xa0 I could see the hardness in his features, the look in his eyes beyond the simple anger on the surface.\\xa0 A kind of hopelessness that went beyond simply being a monster.</p>\\n<p>That hopelessness was, in part, the source of his inhumanity, the willingness to hurt others.</p>\\n<p>I suspected he was irredeemable, if this was left alone.\\xa0 As a human being, flawed and violent and probably beating his girlfriend on the regular, he\\u2019d probably been fixable, but that was no longer the case.\\xa0 His humanity had taken too much of a beating, and there was no light of hope in his eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to get out,\\u201d I said, in a matter-of-fact way, turning my eyes forward.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow do you think that works?\\u201d he asked, and he sounded almost angry.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow many Academy students are down here, do you think?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 Why don\\u2019t you tell me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Enough.\\xa0 </em>Hundreds, probably.\\xa0 Now think, each one of those people has <em>family</em>.\\xa0 They have connections, friends who will ask about them,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I would have been lying if I said I wasn\\u2019t touching on the convict leader\\u2019s past, and the circumstances of his incarceration.\\xa0 He\\u2019d been caught because his girl had had connections.\\xa0 I was doing my best to speak in a language he understood.</p>\\n<p>I was also bending the truth.\\xa0 Not everyone was guaranteed to be down at their stations in the Bowels, and I wasn\\u2019t sure that the Academy would value their lives so highly.\\xa0 It would be easy to sentence all of the people down here to death and then point to legal documents they\\u2019d signed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d the leader didn\\u2019t sound impressed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow think, how many <em>projects </em>are down here?\\xa0 We\\u2019re one, you\\u2019re one, <em>she\\u2019s</em> one.\\xa0 How much money is invested in all of this?\\xa0 It\\u2019s not like they can just take a new student and tell him to go pick up where someone else left off.\\xa0 The question is, are they <em>really</em> willing to abandon all of this, all these people, all the money and investments?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t think so, huh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said, backing me up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, echoing Gordon.\\xa0 \\u201cIt costs them too much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The convict leader gave me a look.\\xa0 I could tell he was having doubts.\\xa0 It was only natural \\u2013 he\\u2019d accepted his death, and now I was giving him a new lease on life.\\xa0 He was experiencing dissonance.</p>\\n<p>In reality, though, it was easier and safer for him on a mental and emotional level to hold to his old ideas, that death was certain.\\xa0 To hold onto those ideas, he had to doubt <em>me</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne of the scientists that worked on us, Lacey, she was terrified of being down here.\\xa0 It\\u2019s what the scientist in charge of us told her,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI overheard.\\xa0 Of course, things are different if an entire <em>section</em> gets locked down, since then they can evacuate the rest, but we have <em>her</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa, still leading us down the extended, curved hallway, glanced back at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd she\\u2019s making it so we can\\u2019t get locked inside one part of this place,\\u201d the leader said, as if I hadn\\u2019t implied it already.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExactly,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cEventually they\\u2019re going to have to decide whether it\\u2019s better to condemn everyone and everything in here, or if they\\u2019re going to open things up and let us out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The convict leader was quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSounds too easy,\\u201d the woman convict said, behind me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not easy at all,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are a lot of problems.\\xa0 For one thing, they\\u2019re going to have a lot of stitched and a lot of guards up there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh?\\u201d the leader grunted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably.\\xa0 And there\\u2019s probably other safeguards down here.\\xa0 Supposed to be a big monster.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGlutton?\\u201d the leader asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGorger,\\u201d the oldest of the convicts said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGorger, right,\\u201d the leader said.\\xa0 He looked back, as if expecting Gorger to be coming down the hall behind us.\\xa0 \\u201cIf she can get us past the protections, she might have a way of dealing with that thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>That\\u2019s not completely out of the question</em>, I thought.\\xa0 I mulled for a second on whether it would be better to disarm him and leave him worrying more or whether I liked him thinking Gorger wasn\\u2019t a problem.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe seems to know a lot of stuff,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said, though it came out more like a \\u2018yeh\\u2019.\\xa0 \\u201cThat leaves the question of what we do to get out, once they open things up and meet us with a small army.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>And quarantine measures, probably, if things even get that far.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we could find some super valuable experiment and threaten to destroy it, or use it against them\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I scratched the back of my head, sticking my thumb straight down.</p>\\n<p>Behind me, Gordon picked up on the cue.\\xa0 \\u201cDoesn\\u2019t work.\\xa0 No saying what\\u2019s valuable enough, or scary enough, or if they have a way of dealing with it, or any of that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I \\u2018conceded\\u2019 the point.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd if we did it out in the open, nobody would blame the Academy if they put a bullet in us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot an object, then,\\u201d the convict leader said.\\xa0 \\u201cPeople.\\xa0 Hostages.\\xa0 You think people down here have friends?\\xa0 People would blame the Academy if they died, a bit away from getting free.\\xa0 And they won\\u2019t be shooting at us without being especially careful.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, as if it hadn\\u2019t been my idea in the first place.\\xa0 I\\u2019d all but directly told him.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa stopped to work on another panel.</p>\\n<p>The big guy looked at the other convicts, as well as my friends.\\xa0 \\u201cHostages, you hear me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were nods.</p>\\n<p>That would save some lives.\\xa0 Sure, some of my motivations had to do with, well,\\xa0<em>saving lives</em> and crap like that.\\xa0 Human decency and whatever.\\xa0 But really, I figured alive people were more useful if we were going to figure this out, it would be brownie points with the faculty if we saved as many lives as possible, and if we had to do more bullcrap interviews to find moles for Head Professor Briggs, then living people we\\u2019d already interviewed were better than new people who needed to be screened.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa finished tearing the console apart and rejigging it in a matter of seconds.</p>\\n<p>It was interesting to see: she\\u2019d been tentative before, but now was finding her stride.\\xa0 This was something she was learning to do, based on some previous knowledge.</p>\\n<p>She knew how to disarm the safety measures, and she\\u2019d known where to find the convicts.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d gone after the man who recognized her.\\xa0 She\\u2019d gone after her creator.</p>\\n<p>Our mysterious experiment was working with some foundation of knowledge.</p>\\n<p>I had questions I wanted to ask Jamie, but I didn\\u2019t dare ask with the convicts and Sub Rosa in earshot.\\xa0 I imagined there was a dim possibility that Sub Rosa had been down here from the beginning.\\xa0 It would explain why she was on an upper floor, if she\\u2019d never been moved.\\xa0 She would have had a chance to overhear things about the security measures.</p>\\n<p>A <em>dim</em> possibility, I reminded myself.\\xa0 Sure, the security measures weren\\u2019t too complex, and some employees down in the Bowels might have heard how to disable the security in an emergency, if an earthquake or something shook things up, but an <em>experiment</em> hearing such?</p>\\n<p>Hard to justify, and it didn\\u2019t explain the man\\u2019s look of recognition, not so long ago.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was striding forward with purpose now, toward the girl who had our answers.\\xa0 We were nearing the end of the hallway, by my recollection.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t been <em>here</em>, but I had seen similar hallways on upper floors.</p>\\n<p>Maybe she knew because she\\u2019d been <em>told</em>.\\xa0 The Academy had enemies, and the Bowels had already been identified and used as a weak point.\\xa0 If one such enemy had found a convict or a dying woman who was to be sent to the Bowels to be used as an experiment, they could have equipped her with knowledge provided by previous moles and spies within the Academy, then have them cause as much damage as possible.</p>\\n<p>If that someone was angry enough, then they might delight in having the chance.</p>\\n<p>Still, it didn\\u2019t explain the recognition.\\xa0 She was an element known to some.</p>\\n<p>Had the man known her as an experiment, or the person she had been <em>before</em>?\\xa0 If the former, what had happened, and why was she on this rampage?\\xa0 If the latter, who the hell was she?</p>\\n<p>We were nearing the end of our destination.\\xa0 Jamie was picking up speed, moving forward in my peripheral vision, so I slowed down, until I was a step behind my smelly buddy.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was hugging his book.\\xa0 I glanced at him, and I saw him shift his grip.\\xa0 On the corner of the cover was a mark in pencil.</p>\\n<p><em>Nineteen</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey, c\\u2019mon,\\u201d the leader said.\\xa0 He reached out for me, hand turned backward, and rubbed my head with his knuckles, deliberately avoiding touching me with the spike, while still urging me forward.\\xa0 \\u201cAlmost showtime.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The far-side labs were larger, more comprehensive, and specialized.\\xa0 When they\\u2019d originally been put together, they\\u2019d been built for specific tasks.\\xa0 Many had even been put together for the superweapons that were now unique to each specific section of the Academy.\\xa0 At this point in time, very few of the old experiments were still running.</p>\\n<p><em>Labs sixteen through twenty.</em></p>\\n<p>All of this hinged on what Sub Rosa did.</p>\\n<p>If she went into one lab, could we escape?\\xa0 Reach Gorger?</p>\\n<p>The instant the thought crossed my mind, she stopped in her tracks, standing in the middle of the hallway.</p>\\n<p><em>Damn it</em>.</p>\\n<p>She raised an arm, pointing.\\xa0 She was giving us an instruction.\\xa0 She fully intended to block anyone from fleeing.\\xa0 We were supposed to go fetch, or go <em>kill</em>.\\xa0 She\\u2019d let us know soon enough.</p>\\n<p>There was no tidy way to do this.\\xa0 Five labs, five convicts, six of us, with me watching \\u2018mad dog\\u2019 Mary.</p>\\n<p>I heard the words in my head before they left his lips.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEach of us gets someone from a room,\\u201d the leader said.\\xa0 \\u201cTake the kids with.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve got these two.\\xa0 Remember, we\\u2019re taking <em>hostages</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were nods.</p>\\n<p>Our last chance for answers.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and the woman took the first door, and Gordon hammered on it, a heavy knock, and also a way of cluing in people further down the hall.</p>\\n<p><em>Good job.</em></p>\\n<p>Helen and shaggy-beardy took the next door, seventeen, with Helen peering down to the mail slot and opening it to speak through it, shaggy standing back, tense.</p>\\n<p>Eighteen was Jamie and baldy-beardy.\\xa0 Jamie used the badge.</p>\\n<p>Nineteen.</p>\\n<p>I approached the door and stopped.\\xa0 While I stood there, thinking, the old man and Lillian walked past us to the last door in the hallway.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was watching, staring with eyes that could no longer blink.\\xa0 An intensity radiated off of her.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d come here for <em>this</em>.\\xa0 For our source of information.\\xa0 The relative of the man who had altered her.</p>\\n<p>I knocked.</p>\\n<p>The door opened, without hesitation.</p>\\n<p>There were two scientists within.\\xa0 One was middle-aged, a woman, brown-haired and stout in build, the other was a wisp of a girl, small and light in every sense of the words.\\xa0 The girl, our source, had opened the door.\\xa0 She was sixteen or so, blonde, hair so fine and insubstantial that it looked like she was underwater, the hair that had come free of her ponytail floating around her, free of gravity\\u2019s pull.\\xa0 Her eyes were dark, glasses cleaner than most, with fine rims.\\xa0 She had a lens on her forehead, something that could be flipped down over one eye to view small things.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>What</em>?\\u201d she asked, in the most impatient, bitchy tone I\\u2019d heard in some time.\\xa0 She looked from me to Mary to the convict leader, then back to me.</p>\\n<p>I hadn\\u2019t expected this attitude.\\xa0 Everyone up to this point had been scared, worried about possibilities.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re aware there\\u2019s an escaped experiment?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat <em>usually</em> goes hand in hand with the facility being sealed,\\u201d she said, in a very condescending way.\\xa0 \\u201cWhatever.\\xa0 It\\u2019s fine, I do hope things open up soon, but I came expecting to put in a full day or two of work with minimal sleep.\\xa0 This doesn\\u2019t change my plans.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStudying bugs,\\u201d I said, eyeing the glass tank in the center of the room.\\xa0 There were flies swarming within.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said, giving me a curious look.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, kids, but if you want someone to hold your hand while you freak out about being stuck down here, this isn\\u2019t the place for it.\\xa0 I have work to do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s, uh\\u2026\\u201d I started.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThings are more complicated than that,\\u201d Mary said, her voice soft.</p>\\n<p>The convict leader behind me spoke up, \\u201cWe\\u2019re taking you hostage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo you\\u2019re not,\\u201d the woman on the other side of the room said.\\xa0 She was studying the tank so intently she\\u2019d barely glanced at us.\\xa0 \\u201cWe <em>just</em> reached the breeding phase.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve been building toward this for four months.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see you need convincing,\\u201d the leader said.\\xa0 He pointed the spike forward.\\xa0 The girl at the door backed away as the leader advanced, weapon ready.\\xa0 I caught the door as she let go of it, but I also stayed in the leader\\u2019s way, so he couldn\\u2019t attack her.\\xa0 I needed her cooperative.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m starting to see how it is,\\u201d the girl said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d the convict said.\\xa0 \\u201cMove, kid.\\xa0 I want to drive the point home.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Here was the moment of truth.\\xa0 I moved suddenly, <em>toward</em> the spike.\\xa0 I\\u2019d build up a rapport with him.\\xa0 Now I tested it.\\xa0 Would he instinctively protect me?</p>\\n<p>He moved the spike out of the way, lifting his arm.</p>\\n<p>But the door- I\\u2019d let go of the door, and now it swung shut.\\xa0 It was metal, it was heavy, and the convict leader lacked <em>hands</em>.</p>\\n<p>He was caught between the door and the frame for a moment, unable to use his shoulder to bump it open without risking the breakage of the glass tank of yellow fluid.</p>\\n<p>I backed across the room as he grunted, moved his leg and kicked it open.</p>\\n<p>In backing away, I moved between the girl and the older woman.\\xa0 Mary followed suit.\\xa0 Where the girl tried to back away, Mary helped me corner her.</p>\\n<p>The convict leader kicked the door open, stepping into the room.\\xa0 Gordon and the convict woman appeared behind him, and Gordon caught the door, keeping it from closing.</p>\\n<p>Two convicts, our two scientists, and Gordon, Mary, and I.</p>\\n<p>The leader gave me an ugly look, but he didn\\u2019t say anything.\\xa0 Was he conscious of the other member of his group, just behind him?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe experiment is here,\\u201d I informed the girl.\\xa0 \\u201cI heard someone call it Sub Rosa.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>No sign of recognition at the name.\\xa0 The older woman didn\\u2019t seem to take special notice either.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProject by Shipman,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m Shipman,\\u201d the younger girl said.\\xa0 \\u201cOh.\\xa0 You mean my uncle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The convict leader frowned at us, a momentary look of puzzlement on his face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow is he?\\u201d Ms. Shipman asked us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDead,\\u201d I said, my voice cold for the leader\\u2019s benefit.\\xa0 \\u201cVery, very dead.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHis creation offed him before starting her rampage through this place.\\xa0 She came for you, it seems.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnough talking,\\u201d the convict leader said.\\xa0 \\u201cGrab them.\\xa0 Tie their hands.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>He jabbed one spike in her direction.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t go talking back to me, brat.\\xa0 I haven\\u2019t forgotten you attacked one of mine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>He\\u2019s insecure.\\xa0 He\\u2019s realizing he doesn\\u2019t have total control, and he\\u2019s acting on it in the way I figured.\\xa0 Violence and threats.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cGet the other woman,\\u201d I told Mary.\\xa0 The woman convict was over there, spikes ready, and I wasn\\u2019t sure I trusted her to keep those weapons to herself.\\xa0 Things were <em>manageable</em>, but the moment they started prodding these two women with spikes to try and make them compliant, the <em>convicts </em>would have their control, and the Lambs wouldn\\u2019t be able to do anything.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot wires?\\u201d Gordon asked from the door.\\xa0 \\u201cRopes?\\xa0 Cord?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d\\xa0 Ms. Shipman said.\\xa0 \\u201cResin gun, but that would burn flesh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe could tear the lab coats into strips,\\u201d Mary said, holding up a knife.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like my lab coat, thank you very much,\\u201d Ms. Shipman said, in a very prim, uptight way.\\xa0 \\u201cI earned it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you like living?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause this is a very real choice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was growing to dislike her with a startling speed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll live, <em>and</em> I\\u2019ll keep my coat,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I may-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She bent down, unclipped a stocking, and then began rolling it down.</p>\\n<p>Was she exceptionally cunning?\\xa0 Because the convict leader was suddenly paying rapt attention.\\xa0 Yes, she was young, but the closest the man had been to a woman had probably been his yellow-skinned fellow convict and Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was paying a great deal of attention too, I noticed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGets cold down here,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut, ugh, skirts are <em>expected</em>.\\xa0 I\\u2019d rather wear trousers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe too,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 A stab at humor.</p>\\n<p>Ms. Shipman didn\\u2019t laugh.\\xa0 She stood straight, stocking in hand, and handed it to me.\\xa0 I balled it up and tossed it to Mary.</p>\\n<p>The young lady started on the other one.\\xa0 The one I\\u2019d be using to tie her up.\\xa0 I looked at her legs, but I didn\\u2019t see the magic that had others so enchanted.\\xa0 Maybe because it was attached to such an unlikable person.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHeads up!\\u201d I heard Gordon comment, in the same moment Ms. Shipman drove her shoulder into my ribs.</p>\\n<p>I tipped over, landing on my ass, and saw her running in the opposite direction, toward the closet in the corner.</p>\\n<p>She was going for her bag?</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t make it.\\xa0 Gordon reached her, wrapping his arms around her upper body, pinning her arms to her side.\\xa0 She had years on him in age, but she was petite, and Gordon was an early bloomer.\\xa0 He was bigger, and he was strong besides.\\xa0 He was able to lift her bodily off the ground.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNice try,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>She bent her head down, mouth yawning open, to bite at the spot where his neck met his shoulder.</p>\\n<p>He practically <em>tossed</em> her, heaving her up and away, then catching her again, this time with her head too high and far back to reach him to bite.</p>\\n<p>She kicked, she struggled, but he didn\\u2019t let her go.\\xa0 After about twenty seconds, both were left panting into one another\\u2019s faces, Ms. Shipman red in the face with spent fury.</p>\\n<p>I reached her and tugged off the stocking that was halfway down her leg.\\xa0 Gordon shifted his grip until her wrists were crossed behind her back.\\xa0 I tied them.</p>\\n<p>She kept struggling and kicked at his shin as he let her down, gripping her by the binding.</p>\\n<p>Idly, I walked over to the closet and found her belongings.</p>\\n<p>Her bag was empty, a quick search through her wallet suggested nothing pertinent.\\xa0 \\u201cGladys Shipman.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi, Gladys,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat the hell do you want?\\xa0 Something came for me?\\xa0 Are you <em>delusional</em>?\\xa0 I\\u2019m not important.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her tone rubbed me the wrong way.\\xa0 It was a perfect storm of condescension, arrogance, and sheer <em>bitchiness</em>.\\xa0 My skin crawled with it.</p>\\n<p><em>I wish I could gag her, but I really want to hear what she says.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cFirst room was empty, by the by,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I searched the remainder of the things in the corner.\\xa0 In the pocket of the smaller of the two raincoats, I found a pistol.\\xa0 Six-shot.\\xa0 I held it up for Mary and Gordon to see.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGimme,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m a better shot than you are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned it around until I was gripping the barrel, pointing it away from anyone, and held the handle toward him.\\xa0 He took it, used one hand to check the ammo count, and slipped it inside his uniform jacket, all while keeping hold of Ms. Shipman\\u2019s arms.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t suppose you feel like talking?\\u201d I asked the young lady.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTalk?\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s too bad,\\u201d I said, meaning it.\\xa0 I reached for her, but Gordon didn\\u2019t hand her over.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m good,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve got the gun.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe got you once, while you were looking at her legs, and I\\u2019m stronger,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t correct him about the leg thing.</p>\\n<p>Mary had the older woman, who was quickly taken over by the convict woman, who held spikes to the woman\\u2019s neck.\\xa0 I was left with my hands in my pocket as we retreated from the room.</p>\\n<p>Mary clapped a hand on my shoulder in a gesture of support, which was totally unnecessary, but I let her do it for <em>her</em> benefit.</p>\\n<p>We stepped out into the hallway.\\xa0 The others were there.\\xa0 Two scientists were with them.\\xa0 One was badly bruised at the forehead.</p>\\n<p>Ms. Shipman turned her head to give Lillian a quizzical look.\\xa0 She opened her mouth to say something, and I jabbed her in the side, giving her a warning look.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa reacted the instant our Ms. Shipman was brought out into the open.\\xa0 She drew nearer.</p>\\n<p>The <em>intensity</em> we\\u2019d experienced was ratcheting up by the second.\\xa0 Something like fury, but not <em>anger</em>.\\xa0 Something parallel.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d Ms. Shipman said, her voice suddenly, mercifully very small.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa reached out for Ms. Shipman\\u2019s head.\\xa0 I felt my heart sink.</p>\\n<p><em>Repeat performance</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>No answers.</em></p>\\n<p>At least we had a game plan.</p>\\n<p>Gordon moved, a sudden, swift motion, reaching into his jacket.</p>\\n<p><em>Wait, what?</em></p>\\n<p>He fired from the hip.\\xa0 Sub Rosa flinched, her entire upper body twisting, with blood spraying the ceiling.</p>\\n<p>Gordon fired again, turning as the bullet left the chamber, to aim at the convicts.</p>\\n<p>But Sub Rosa had taken a second shot to the face, and she hadn\\u2019t died.\\xa0 The damage was grievous, immense, but she hadn\\u2019t fallen.\\xa0 She continued reaching out, with one hand for Ms. Shipman and one now meant for Gordon.</p>\\n<p><em>Why?</em></p>\\n<p>He raised the gun, aiming, and fired.\\xa0 Four more shots, in quick succession, all aimed for the head.\\xa0 One hit the neck, but the rest were on point.</p>\\n<p><em>What are you doing?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe hell!?\\u201d the convict leader shouted.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa collapsed against the wall.</p>\\n<p>Gordon returned to using the gun to try and scare off the other threats behind us.</p>\\n<p>The rest of us took the opportunity to run.\\xa0 I saw Sub Rosa reach weakly for Mary\\u2019s leg, and leaped on top of her wrist, pushing it down before carrying on my way.</p>\\n<p>I nearly lost my balance as she heaved herself to her feet again, the angle of her arm changing in the process.\\xa0 Mary caught me, twisted, and flung a knife.</p>\\n<p>One convict dropped.</p>\\n<p><em>Gordon, why?\\xa0 We were having enough trouble with coordination with Mary\\u2019s screwup.\\xa0 Why this?</em></p>\\n<p>We were being chased, and it was an unfortunate fact that Jamie and Lillian weren\\u2019t the fastest of us.\\xa0 Helen\\u2019s physical structure was different, and sustained running was hard for her.\\xa0 We also had a set of scientists from the Bowels with us.\\xa0 Ms. Shipman, her companion, and the ones from the other rooms.</p>\\n<p>The convict leader shouted something about six shots.</p>\\n<p>He knew as well as we did that we were out of bullets.</p>\\n<p>It was a long journey down the long hallway, but as it turned out, my concerns about our ability to outpace the convicts and a still-alive Sub Rosa were unfounded.</p>\\n<p>Gorger stood at the other end of the hallway.</p>\\n<p>To be more specific, Gorger <em>filled</em> the other end of the Hallway.\\xa0 He was a massive physical form, a living seal to occupy the entirety of the hallway, capable of advancing, reaching to hold, and devouring to contain, though that last option was meant for hardier things than mere humans.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d arrived at the worst moment, blocking our only escape route.</p>\\n<p>All things clicked into place as I saw Gordon tighten his grip around Ms. Shipman, keeping her steady as she ran.</p>\\n<p><em>Of all the times to develop a first crush, Gordon my man.\\xa0 Of all the damn times\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>I sighed.</p>\\n<p>Had to figure out a way out of this, and we had to do it while keeping Gordon\\u2019s crush alive.\\xa0 Matter of principle, really, questions of taste and approach aside.\\xa0 Guy didn\\u2019t have that long left.</p>\\n<p>With nowhere left to run, we stopped in our tracks, turning to face down our pursuers, who included Sub Rosa, bleeding openly from six bullet wounds.</p>\\n<p><em>Damn it, do you ever owe us for this one, though</em>.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/06/06/lips-sealed-3-7/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The hallway was wide enough that Jamie and I could have held hands and stretched our arms out to either side and only barely touched both walls.\\xa0 The ceiling was high enough that Sub Rosa didn\\u2019t have to stoop down to avoid banging her head.</p>\\n<p>Gorger filled the entirety of that space.\\xa0 His physical structure was organized to let him move forward at a good speed with the use of his arms and legs.\\xa0 Abrasive skin, thick enough that bullets would be stopped or slowed, resistant to fire, resistant to chemicals, and immune to all known forms of disease.\\xa0 His body was hostile to parasites, and his stomach was a holding chamber for tough specimens, a compactor for smaller ones.\\xa0 His weak points had been minimized, and the ones that could be buried deep within his center of mass were.\\xa0 The remainder of him was self sustaining and built to last.\\xa0 Raw mass and power for the sake of such.</p>\\n<p>No exit.</p>\\n<p>We backed up until we were nearly touching him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi Gorger,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cGood to see you, mate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d Gorger grunted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re in our way,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d he grunted.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was approaching, one hand pressed to the one side of her head where the injuries were more severe.\\xa0 She moved in a jerky fashion, unpredictable, lunging and lurching forward in a zig-zag fashion, every movement violent, and the convicts were keeping their distance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t suppose you can back up?\\xa0 Or squeeze over to let us by?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm-mm,\\u201d he grunted.</p>\\n<p>I almost took it for assent, but I looked back and saw his head, pulled back into his neck and shoulders, as protected as he could get it, moving from side to side.\\xa0 Rolls of fat moved with the action.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBloody hell,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho <em>are</em> you?\\u201d the woman that had been working with Gladys asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOfficial Academy problem solvers,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cSo all of you shut your mouths, be quiet, and let us solve this problem.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said, with a warning tone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUntie her,\\u201d I said, not taking my eyes off of Sub Rosa.\\xa0 \\u201cReload, shoot more?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOut,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 Then to Gladys, he added, \\u201cGot more bullets?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn my coat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRats,\\u201d I said, with emphasis.\\xa0 \\u201cMary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary gave me a look over her shoulder.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t the Mary I was used to.\\xa0 She looked a little <em>uncertain</em>, even.\\xa0 Lost, hurt.\\xa0 Her confidence was still shaken from earlier.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou with us?\\u201d I asked, my words carefully chosen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m with you,\\u201d she said, stumbling a bit with the odd placement of the words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know I\\u2019m thinking about ways out.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s wracking his brain for anything in her files we could use.\\xa0 Gordon\\u2019s thinking about what to do if worst comes to worst.\\xa0 If I know you, you\\u2019re thinking about what to do to <em>hurt</em> her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary broke eye contact, looking at Sub Rosa.\\xa0 Thirty feet away, twenty-eight, twenty-six\\u2026 not moving in a straight line, the experiment was periodically reaching out to touch a wall and steady herself.</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHurt her,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you <em>talking</em> about?\\u201d Gladys asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t-\\u201d Mary started.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can do it.\\xa0 And it\\u2019s going to be awesome.\\xa0 I promise,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is <em>she</em> going to do that six bullets couldn\\u2019t?\\u201d Gladys asked.</p>\\n<p><em>Come on, Mary, shut this girl up.\\xa0 Please.</em></p>\\n<p>Mary was already stepping forward.\\xa0 Her fingers touched the sides of her legs, reached up beneath her Academy uniform skirt, and plucked knives free.\\xa0 Her right hand stayed at her leg, fiddling for a second, while still holding the knife.</p>\\n<p>A coil of something dropped from her upper thigh to her ankle.\\xa0 She rotated her foot to position it, then kicked it up into the air with her toe.\\xa0 She caught it out of the air, not breaking eye contact with the incoming Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was close enough that Mary could have reached her in three or four running paces.\\xa0 The experiment paused to touch the wall for balance and twist to stare at us with her good eye.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh god,\\u201d Gladys said.\\xa0 There were similar utterances from the others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh god,\\u201d Lillian echoed her, but she added a, \\u201c<em>Please</em>, Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary let the loop uncoil, extending into a crazy mess that sagged to her feet.\\xa0 Her wrist made three quick circles, and then she <em>threw, </em>right as Sub Rosa made her final lunge for us.</p>\\n<p>The knife sank into Sub Rosa\\u2019s eye socket.</p>\\n<p>The woman barely flinched.\\xa0 If anything, it egged her on.</p>\\n<p>Mary turned, having already drawn a third knife, one meant for close-quarters fighting, and held the blade, extending the handle above her head while using her other hand to throw the second knife.\\xa0 It was a fierce throw, and it wasn\\u2019t aimed toward Sub Rosa.\\xa0 It was aimed the light above us.</p>\\n<p>The light flashed as it broke, and shards of glass joined sparks in raining down onto our heads.</p>\\n<p>Two more lights further down the hallway went out.</p>\\n<p>We were cast into relative darkness.\\xa0 I saw Sub Rosa\\u2019s form in only the split second the light flashed.\\xa0 She was stricken, rearing back.</p>\\n<p>I heard her hit the floor, rather than seeing it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat the fucking hell?\\u201d the convict leader asked.\\xa0 He\\u2019d seen Sub Rosa drop too.</p>\\n<p>I threw my arms around Mary in a hug.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCareful,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t touch the wire.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wire.\\xa0 Tying the knives together.\\xa0 One knife in Sub Rosa, one in the light socket.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKnife fell,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re safe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet go of me, Sy.\\xa0 She\\u2019s not dead.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I let go of Mary as quickly as I\\u2019d grabbed her, backing away to give her exactly as much space as she needed.</p>\\n<p>A small flame appeared.</p>\\n<p>In a moment, there was a second flame.</p>\\n<p>I heard her throw it more than I saw it.\\xa0 A small vial, hurled in Sub Rosa\\u2019s direction.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t hit Sub Rosa, but the wall above her.\\xa0 Glass broke, and the liquid ignited before it landed on her, where it promptly spread out to cover a fair amount of surface.\\xa0 We were soon treated to a view of Sub Rosa, midway through the process of finding her feet.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t scream.\\xa0 That was the eeriest part.\\xa0 It was an almost silent dance, thrashing, arms flailing, striking the wall with enough force that I could hear mechanisms rattling, wanting to kick into motion and seal this section off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGreat,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Sub Rosa was stumbling around, largely blind at this point, but she managed to touch a wall, find some orientation and stagger toward us, while struggling to wipe away the flaming liquid with her hands.\\xa0 She only partially succeeded, and her hands ignited.\\xa0 \\u201cNow she\\u2019s on fire.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore fire?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>She handed something to Mary.\\xa0 Mary hucked it at Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>Whatever it was, it ignited marvelously.\\xa0 It made Sub Rosa\\u2019s movements more frantic and crazed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot helping!\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s not dying!\\u201d Mary observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe <em>can\\u2019t</em>,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re looking at <em>two</em> lifeforms.\\xa0 The cocoon and the woman.\\xa0 The cocoon keeps everything going, no matter what.\\xa0 Only way you can make her <em>dead-</em>dead is if you utterly destroy the medulla oblongata or utterly destroy the heart.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell us that sooner!\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were busy electrocuting her and setting her on fire!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was close, now.</p>\\n<p>Gordon threw the pistol, tossing it over Sub Rosa\\u2019s shoulder.</p>\\n<p>The sound made her stop, twisting.</p>\\n<p>She began moving in the other direction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo!\\u201d the convict leader shouted.\\xa0 \\u201cThe little bastards are behind you!\\xa0 Don\\u2019t be fooled!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa twisted back around, but staggered, leaning against the wall.\\xa0 I could smell the burned flesh, now.\\xa0 There was an acrid undertone to it, something chemical.\\xa0 One of the tubes of fluid that had been pumping in or out of her was emptying contents on to the floor.</p>\\n<p>I fixated on that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe tubes?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWeak point?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe fluids adjust chemical balances,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWithout them, she\\u2019ll die.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGreat!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMary-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn a few days or weeks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Hell!</em>\\u201d I said, frustrated.</p>\\n<p>The sound of our voices was getting her attention.\\xa0 She was still burning, still in agony, largely blind and bleeding from open wounds in her skull.\\xa0 She even had brain damage from the bullets, probably.\\xa0 But she was lurching our way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t- what?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIdeas!\\u201d I yelled at her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo!\\u201d\\xa0 She said, a non-sequitur.\\xa0 As if she was refusing to give them, rather than having none.</p>\\n<p>But, short of an <em>actual</em> idea, it was the best response she could give.\\xa0 Short, sweet, and to the point, letting me move on to other options.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGladys!\\u201d I called out.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you know what she is-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t!\\xa0 I know <em>who</em> she is but I don\\u2019t understand any of this!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s your dad\\u2019s work!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUncle\\u2019s!\\xa0 My uncle\\u2019s work!\\xa0 And we don\\u2019t talk!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Useless!</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen?\\u201d I tried, though Helen was more about instinct than anything else.\\xa0 \\u201cAnything?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut can\\u2019t just yet.\\xa0 Gorger?\\xa0 A hand?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I realized he\\u2019d backed up a good ten feet.\\xa0 I joined the others in making haste, working to put as much space between us and Sub Rosa as possible.</p>\\n<p>In the gloom, lit only by the fire that still licked Sub Rosa\\u2019s upper body, I could see Gorger twisting, revealing and then extending a meaty hand.\\xa0 Helen hopped up to it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUp,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 Gorger raised her up toward the ceiling.</p>\\n<p>I saw her reach up to pry at a ceiling panel that Gorger had just revealed.</p>\\n<p><em>Bring an entire block down on us?</em></p>\\n<p>Beside me, Mary whipped more knives at Sub Rosa.\\xa0 It was pretty ineffectual.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d Helen said, very simply.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease help.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon did, abandoning his Shipman, stepping on Gorger\\u2019s face for a foothold before stepping onto Gorger\\u2019s arm, then moving up to the hand, standing beside Helen.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was too close.</p>\\n<p>There was nothing predictable about her movements.\\xa0 She was broken, not thinking clearly, if she was thinking at all.\\xa0 Yet, if I was going to save the others, I had to take the gamble.\\xa0 Not once, but twice.</p>\\n<p>In moments like this, I had to have a simple set of goals.\\xa0 If I didn\\u2019t, I tended to overthink.</p>\\n<p><em>Goal one\\u2026 don\\u2019t get hit.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep at it!\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>Then I dashed for Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>One long arm flailed, reaching low to the ground.\\xa0 I saw it coming, but even then, there was precious little I could actually do about it.\\xa0 I was fast on my feet, and it wasn\\u2019t an asset here.\\xa0 To actually stop moving, I tried to drop low, sliding, but ended up flopping onto my back, my tailbone cracking hard against the floor.</p>\\n<p>The hand swept just above me.\\xa0 She stepped closer, and her <em>other</em> hand came perilously close to touching me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLittle bastard\\u2019s at your feet!\\u201d the convict leader howled.</p>\\n<p>I supposed I wasn\\u2019t his buddy anymore.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was blind, but she could apparently hear.\\xa0 She bent low, hands groping.\\xa0 I rolled to one side, bumping up against the wall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour right!\\u201d Baldy-beardy called out.</p>\\n<p>I scrambled back, toward my compatriots and the other scientists, as Sub Rosa fumbled toward me.</p>\\n<p>The flames were dying down, and her eyeball was revealed, bloodshot, oozing, but it didn\\u2019t look nearly as damaged as I\\u2019d hoped.\\xa0 Poor woman, not being able to blink or close her eyes while her head and upper body were on fire.</p>\\n<p>I saw the eye move, focusing on me.</p>\\n<p>Another throwing knife struck Sub Rosa.\\xa0 She twisted, looking away from me to see Mary.</p>\\n<p>I used that chance to dart close, moving past Sub Rosa, putting myself between her and the convicts.</p>\\n<p><em>Goal two: distract her, buy the others time</em>.</p>\\n<p>I still had the knife I\\u2019d gotten from Mary.</p>\\n<p>Gripping the knife in both hands, swinging it from behind me, over my head, and forward, I slammed it into Sub Rosa\\u2019s back, near a point where it looked like things unfolded from.\\xa0 Closer to her own tailbone.</p>\\n<p>I was already backing away, moving clear when she swung her hand my way.\\xa0 Her hand hit the wall hard enough to leave cracks and do some substantial damage to her.</p>\\n<p><em>Goal three, optional: don\\u2019t die while seeing goal two through.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cLittle bastard.\\xa0 Lied to us, didn\\u2019t you?!\\u201d the convict leader bellowed.\\xa0 \\u201cKilled Old Craig!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>That was Mary, not me.\\xa0 Throwing her knife as we made our getaway.</em></p>\\n<p><em>But I made you look like a fool, you fool, and you can never forgive me for that.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat I told you wasn\\u2019t all a lie!\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I had to leap back to avoid Sub Rosa\\u2019s swipe.\\xa0 She turned her back on the others while pursuing me.</p>\\n<p>Leaping back unfortunately put me closer to the convict leader and his three remaining cronies.\\xa0 Baldy-Beardy, Shaggy-Beardy, and the woman convict, who looked especially wary and concerned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRemember everything I told you before!?\\u201d he roared.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m going to do worse, you hear me!?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen she continues her rampage, she kills you, and <em>everyone</em> dies!\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t care!\\xa0 I\\u2019m going to make it slow!\\xa0 If I have to suffocate down here, I\\u2019m going to take my time with you!\\xa0 You\\u2019ll <em>crave</em> the times I\\u2019m making you twitch with these spikes, because at least then I won\\u2019t be carving bits off you!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Ticked off Academy experiment on one side of me, ticked off Academy experiments on the other side of me.</em></p>\\n<p>I backed out of the way of another swipe.</p>\\n<p>I saw the convict leader smile.\\xa0 A mean, sadistic sort of grin.\\xa0 A <em>cat</em> grin.\\xa0 As much as the younger kids at the Orphanage liked to coo over kittens, I knew what cats really were.\\xa0 I was aware that they were one of the rare species out there that killed and tormented other animals to death for their own amusement, be they barnyard cats or house cats.\\xa0 One cat, left to its own devices for a few days, would chalk up <em>scores</em> of kills that it didn\\u2019t eat, and not all were vermin.</p>\\n<p>Cats were <em>detestable,</em> viewed objectively.</p>\\n<p>I could <em>respect</em> that side of cats.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t like seeing those same elements in a man three or four times my size, especially when that man was pissed off and using the Academy-designed weapons that had been built into his body.\\xa0 Left to <em>his</em> own devices, I had no doubt he could amuse himself doing exactly what he\\u2019d threatened.</p>\\n<p>A <em>tink</em> sound marked the collision of one glass bottle against the ceiling.\\xa0 It dinked off of Sub Rosa\\u2019s head and clattered to the floor, a few feet from me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was supposed to break!\\u201d Mary called out.\\xa0 \\u201cIs it broken!?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I only had a few feet of space, now.</p>\\n<p>The convict leader stopped, grinning at me, arms spread wide.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on!\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cRight into my waiting arms!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I moved in the opposite direction, toward Sub Rosa and the fallen bottle.</p>\\n<p>I got a foot from the bottle when her arm came down, overhand.\\xa0 I stopped just in time to avoid having it come down on my head.\\xa0 I snatched for the bottle and missed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing!?\\u201d Mary called out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrying to grab-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I moved out of the way of Sub Rosa\\u2019s reaching arm, which meant throwing myself belly first into the long flaps of skin that surrounded her legs.\\xa0 My head was only a short distance from the fire that still burned at her left breast.</p>\\n<p>Her arms came down to embrace me, wrists crossing behind me, hands reaching out to block my escape routes, or to clutch at me if I tried to slip by.</p>\\n<p>It was a smarter action than many of her actions had been recently.\\xa0 Was she recovering?\\xa0 Was she more able to <em>think</em>, now that she wasn\\u2019t on fire?</p>\\n<p>I stopped to think, to try and process a way out, and the conclusion I came to was that I <em>might</em> have managed it if I hadn\\u2019t stopped to think.</p>\\n<p>Mary hadn\\u2019t thrown another bottle or vial.</p>\\n<p>Something about this one, she\\u2019d hoped to use it.</p>\\n<p>I felt the fingers close around me.\\xa0 In the split-second before I was heaved up off the ground, I kicked the bottle, sending it skittering along the stone floor, in Mary\\u2019s direction.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa hauled me up, her wrists uncrossing as she did, turning me upside down in the process.</p>\\n<p>I could have cut her face if I had the knife, but I\\u2019d left it embedded in her lower back.</p>\\n<p>Held aloft, I was face to face with her.\\xa0 Well, face to upside-down face.\\xa0 Or vice versa.</p>\\n<p>It hardly mattered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you <em>really</em> want to hurt Shipman, I can tell you how,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>There was no response, no recognition.\\xa0 She moved one hand to grab me by the ankle, then swung me back over her shoulder.\\xa0 I realized where I was, fumbled for my knife, and didn\\u2019t find it.\\xa0 She changed the angle she held me, and I realized what she was doing.</p>\\n<p><em>This is the part where she swings me into the ground and dashes my brains out.</em></p>\\n<p><em>That\\u2019s kind of fitting.</em></p>\\n<p>It was eerie, the quiet that came over my thoughts, even as my body was caught in the grips of almost pissing itself, hand scrabbling for a knife that I cognitively <em>knew</em> was out of reach, my heart pounding, breath catching in my throat in preparation to say something, or maybe to scream one last time.</p>\\n<p>For the first time in a very long time, my thoughts weren\\u2019t noisy or conflicted or stumbling over each other in a constant interweaving.\\xa0 My brain was a spot of tranquility in a setting of fire, meat, blood, and chaos.\\xa0 <em>That</em> world moved in slow motion.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to say something witty, but the words caught in my throat, because I didn\\u2019t have enough time, because I knew the others would take my words for more than they were supposed to be.</p>\\n<p>Instead, I let out a long sigh, and I felt my body find the stillness, or something approximating it.\\xa0 I stopped searching for the knife.\\xa0 My arms dangled.</p>\\n<p>I heard the crash.</p>\\n<p>I felt her tense, moving me, swinging me up and forward.</p>\\n<p>She released her grip.\\xa0 In the end, I wound up doing a backflip or two before cracking my head on the floor.</p>\\n<p>I saw her move, her hands clutched into claws, back arching.\\xa0 Foam was bubbling up where the liquid had landed.</p>\\n<p>She was covered in burns, and burns hurt.\\xa0 Whatever Lillian had provided for Mary to throw, it was one of those things that stung like nothing else when poured over an injury.</p>\\n<p>I knew, because Lillian had used those ones on me when I\\u2019d spent the day annoying her and happened to get hurt in the field.</p>\\n<p>It had taken me a few times to catch on.</p>\\n<p>I lay there on the ground, belly up, staring at Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMove, you <em>imbecile</em>!\\u201d Gordon bellowed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRun!\\u201d Mary shrieked.</p>\\n<p>Oh.\\xa0 Yeah.</p>\\n<p>With the passing of that endless quiet, I felt almost sick to my stomach.\\xa0 My body felt disconnected, as if I were at the controls of some monstrosity of flesh and metal and something had jarred me, leading me to forget which lever moved which extremity.</p>\\n<p>I figured out the controls.\\xa0 I flipped myself over, crawled, then ran away, while Sub Rosa was still standing there, twisting in place, as if there was some specific configuration of her body that she could discover that would make all the pain stop.</p>\\n<p><em>We just keep making her madder</em>.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Helen had opened up the ceiling.\\xa0 Gladys, Helen, Jamie and the other scientists were already up, and Lillian was in the process of climbing up Gorger\\u2019s arm.</p>\\n<p>It struck me that the ceiling escape route wasn\\u2019t an escape route at all.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t a ventilation tube or anything of the sort.</p>\\n<p>No.\\xa0 That would be one of the channels that gas, water, or other sterilization measures would use to cleanse an area of any ongoing problems.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa <em>knew</em> the security measures.\\xa0 She knew how to disable them, and it stood to reason she knew how to <em>enable</em> them.\\xa0 I\\u2019d seen glimmers of residual intelligence in her.\\xa0 However much damage those bullets had or hadn\\u2019t done, I didn\\u2019t like the gamble we were making here.</p>\\n<p><em>I hope Gorger can handle this</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p><em>Except Gorger is one of those measures.</em></p>\\n<p>Mary made her way up.\\xa0 Gordon, ever the gentleman, averted his gaze as her skirt brushed past his head.</p>\\n<p>I still had to scale Gorger\\u2019s arm to reach the ceiling.\\xa0 \\u201cGo!\\u201d I called up to him.\\xa0 \\u201cHelp me up when you\\u2019re up!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He obeyed.\\xa0 The moment Mary was clear, he hauled himself up.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa chased me, though it was hard to tell.\\xa0 With the fire dying, the world around me was rendered in black and slices of a grey that was best described as almost-black.</p>\\n<p>Funny thing, when being chased, when one had to run toward the threat.\\xa0 Much as Gordon had, I had to step on Gorger\\u2019s body to get up to his shoulder and arm, though I was a touch graceless in the process, dropping to all fours to find a surer grip.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa drew nearer.\\xa0 A few feet away, reaching around the arm for me-</p>\\n<p>Gorger dropped his arm, swinging clumsily at her.\\xa0 I nearly lost my balance, grabbed at his thumb, and when I felt myself nearly falling, all the same, I stuck a foot out, planting it on Sub Rosa\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p>It made for a terrifying moment.</p>\\n<p>What drove me to move, the thing that set every nerve to firing well before Sub Rosa lashed out or before Gorger started raising me up toward the section of ceiling where the stone tile had been pulled free, was a horrible, core-of-my-being fear of that alluring quiet I had experienced.\\xa0 I felt that uneasy sickness accompany my movements as I made my way up.</p>\\n<p>I found Gordon\\u2019s reaching hand, slapped my wrist into it, and gripped his wrist.\\xa0 With his help from above and Gorger\\u2019s from below, I found my way into the shaft.</p>\\n<p>Looking back over my shoulder, I saw Sub Rosa backing off.</p>\\n<p>I saw her point.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re kidding me,\\u201d the convict leader said.</p>\\n<p>Another point, a sharp gesture, pointing.</p>\\n<p><em>Oh.</em></p>\\n<p><em>They were her measure against Gorger</em>.</p>\\n<p>I saw the convicts approach Gorger, spikes held out, jabbing, their movements uncertain.</p>\\n<p>I saw Sub Rosa turn, lurching down the other direction, to the far end of the hall.</p>\\n<p>We needed to get as much distance as possible from them before that measure worked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy.\\xa0 Are you okay?\\u201d Jamie called back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHead hurts.\\xa0 Tailbone hurts.\\xa0 Body hurts.\\xa0 I legitimately thought I\\u2019d die,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou and us both, Sly,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I thought of Mary.\\xa0 Of how despondent she\\u2019d been.\\xa0 She needed a win.\\xa0 \\u201cMary saved me there, I think.\\xa0 Or Lillian did.\\xa0 Or both.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was only silence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor the record, Gordon, you\\u2019ve officially lost the right to call me out on mistakes and bad calls.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe needed to save Gladys.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight, because we\\u2019ve never had to deal with acceptable losses before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho <em>are</em> you?\\u201d Gladys Shipman asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI know that girl interviewed me before, but none of <em>this- </em>What <em>was</em> all that?\\xa0 What acceptable losses have you dealt with before?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The channel was narrow, only about two and a half feet by two and a half feet.\\xa0 Two of the others further up had some light, and it reflected off of moisture that clung to the walls and floor, giving me <em>some</em> illumination.</p>\\n<p>Of course, all I had to look at was Gordon\\u2019s butt.</p>\\n<p>I <em>really</em> hoped that Sub Rosa didn\\u2019t manage to activate the sterilization protocol we were presently navigating.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t want the last thing I saw before I died a fiery or drowning death to be Gordon\\u2019s butt.</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s butt?\\xa0 Maybe.</p>\\n<p>Lillian\\u2019s butt?\\xa0 Now <em>that</em> would be my pick.\\xa0 I imagined Lillian would <em>hate</em> it if she died knowing I was staring at her butt.</p>\\n<p>I felt giddy after my near slip from death, and the musings on <em>butts</em> of all things made me giggle a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGladys,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou said you <em>knew</em> her?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Anyone who\\u2019s been down here for twelve or so years knows her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>How</em> old are you?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSixteen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour uncle had you down here as a kid?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 I heard the stories.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho is she?\\u201d I asked, impatient.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s the woman who built the Bowels,\\u201d Gladys said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe made the initial decisions on how to design Gorger, though she didn\\u2019t do the actual work.\\xa0 Which is how she operated, really.\\xa0 Or so I heard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot useful,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cClarify, <em>explain</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI <em>am</em>,\\u201d Gladys said, her voice sharp.</p>\\n<p>I was glad I didn\\u2019t have a view of <em>her</em> butt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe made this place, she designed the security, she designed <em>Gorger</em>,\\u201d Gordon said, voice calm, as if trying to guide by example.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd when it all came down to it, she became an experiment?\\xa0 That\\u2019s dedicated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s\\u2026 no,\\u201d Gladys said.</p>\\n<p>We stopped, and I managed to avoid head<em>butting</em> Gordon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gladys said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe didn\\u2019t make this place.\\xa0 She oversaw it all.\\xa0 The deep excavation of the shaft and individual labs, she decided the protocols for security and what Gorger needed to be, and she decided who got to work in the Bowels.\\xa0 She was the overseer more than anything.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>I snickered to myself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIgnore him,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a long story,\\u201d Gladys said.\\xa0 \\u201cI only heard bits and pieces.\\xa0 I remember seeing her as a kid.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve seen pictures that are mounted in the stairways at Claret Hall.\\xa0 She was a tyrant.\\xa0 She demanded security protocols that nobody could follow, and canceled working projects when those protocols weren\\u2019t followed.\\xa0 Everyone hated her, and it got\\u2026 it got bad.\\xa0 A lot of things that are wrong with Radham Academy today, they can be traced back to her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen managed to open the grate.\\xa0 Easier from here than there, apparently.\\xa0 Light flooded the shaft from the lit hallway below.</p>\\n<p>Helen dropped down.\\xa0 We began to edge forward, each of us dropping down, one by one.\\xa0 The adults would be able to catch the rest of us.</p>\\n<p>It was painfully slow, and I didn\\u2019t know what was going on with Gorger and the woman that had decided how he would work.</p>\\n<p>When I finally dropped down, Gladys was still explaining, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t put the pieces together until I saw her.\\xa0 I knew she died down here\\u2026 not so long ago.\\xa0 More and more, as time went on, she became an administrator.\\xa0 But she was always this horrible tyrant.\\xa0 Things have been better since, less stringent, <em>workable</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>According to your uncle,</em> I thought.\\xa0 It was a biased, one-sided story, and I didn\\u2019t like Gladys enough to take her side.</p>\\n<p>Still, I kept my mouth shut for Gordon\\u2019s sake.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe died, and my uncle always said these cryptic things after\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe kept her alive,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Gladys said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe kept her alive, eyes open, mouth clamped shut, <em>trapped</em>, with her brain mostly in working order,\\u201d I elaborated.</p>\\n<p>I saw the woman who\\u2019d worked with Gladys raise her hands to her mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Gladys said, and it was a testament to her humanity that she sounded as upset as she did.\\xa0 Her fingers clutched at her lab coat, right over her heart.</p>\\n<p>Gordon reached out to take her hands, reassuring.</p>\\n<p><em>I was right!</em>\\xa0 I cheered in my head.\\xa0 <em>Go, Gordon!</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook,\\u201d Lillian said, pointing.</p>\\n<p>Ever the killjoy.</p>\\n<p>Gorger\\u2019s back.\\xa0 He was <em>retreating</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to go,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>There was no disagreement.</p>\\n<p>But, being the last one down, furthest back from the direction we wanted to go, I also happened to have the best view of the group and our surroundings.</p>\\n<p>On Gordon\\u2019s back was a <em>bug</em>.</p>\\n<p>Looking down on me, I saw two.\\xa0 Akin to a honeybee, but black from head to hind-end.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBugs,\\u201d I said, almost absently.</p>\\n<p>I saw Gladys turn, her eyes widening.</p>\\n<p>At the vent above us, more swarmed.</p>\\n<p>A scuffling sound echoed.\\xa0 We were being followed.</p>\\n<p>The scuffling became a <em>snuffling, a snort</em>, a grunt, and then a nails-on-blackboard scrape of something against stone.</p>\\n<p>I saw one of the other scientists in our group blanch.</p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019s letting everything out, now</em>.</p>\\n<p>How fitting, that the woman who argued so fiercely for better security down here was the one exploiting it all.</p>\\n<p>We didn\\u2019t dare shout, for fear of agitating the swarm or luring something after us.</p>\\n<p>Silently, collectively, we <em>ran.</em></p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/06/09/lips-sealed-3-8/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Reaching the main shaft of the Academy\\u2019s dungeon-laboratories did remarkably little to quiet the creeping feeling of claustrophobia, if that was even the right word.</p>\\n<p>Before, the Bowels had been a deep, complicated hole, sealed tight, that just so happened to have hostile enemies in it.\\xa0 I could process it as I would with any other place in Radham.\\xa0 There were always dangers.\\xa0 Sometimes less, sometimes more, and sure, a nine foot tall, undying killing machine with a deep understanding of how this place functioned was <em>more</em>, but it wasn\\u2019t too far from business as usual.</p>\\n<p>We immediately headed <em>up</em>, winding our way around the interior of the cylindrical shaft.\\xa0 We had people of different sizes and ages, some old, and some, mainly <em>us</em> were young.</p>\\n<p>Short legs sucked.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t wait until I grew.</p>\\n<p>The madness that spilled out of the corridor we\\u2019d left a few minutes ago was why I felt claustrophobic now.\\xa0 The surroundings were actively hostile, and they were hostile in a way I couldn\\u2019t grasp yet.\\xa0 It was already dark there, where Mary had destroyed the lightbulb, but the darkness now came alive.\\xa0 The dark bodies of large bugs spread out to nearby stairs, railing, and wall, and they were soon followed by small humanoid figures.</p>\\n<p>The humanoid things were sleek and black, like eels, gaunt, the things crawled on the walls.\\xa0 Where they touched a surface, earthworm-like tendrils snapped out, each tendril turning regularly at sharp right angles, never overlapping or coming too close to one another.\\xa0 The walls beneath their hands and feet became maze-like patterns, snapping out into existence in a half-second, then disappearing just as fast as they moved forward.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d seen something like that in some sea creature.</p>\\n<p>Their eyes were as dark as their skin.\\xa0 They snorted and snuffled, and they scampered along the walls with a surprising speed, more visible from the way the light caught on the tendrils than for their actual bodies.</p>\\n<p>I saw some pause and crane their heads around almost one hundred and eighty degrees to look back and up at us, as we continued to make our way upward.\\xa0 Three of them immediately started moving directly <em>up</em>.</p>\\n<p>We were making our way up the spiral staircase, and by going straight <em>up</em>, they were able to reach the section of stairs we had yet to reach, further ahead of us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho made those!?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe did,\\u201d one of the scientists with us said.\\xa0 He had an accent.\\xa0 German, possibly, or Dutch.\\xa0 Jamie would know, if I were to interrupt and ask.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExplain!\\xa0 In brief!\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re weapons!\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Great</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLess brief!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe tendrils are supposed to maximize surface area.\\xa0 They saw into flesh on contact and on leaving, and they apply a contact poison.\\xa0 It\\u2019s injected through the injury, and it breaks down the fat in the hypodermis.\\xa0 It\\u2019s meant for night raids, Phobos and Deimos approach.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cTranslate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCuts skin into- um, into those patterns you see them making on the wall.\\xa0 Breaks down the part under the skin, enough to make it slough off?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d the scientist said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSkin comes off in strips and squares?\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The things had reached the stairs above us.\\xa0 As they climbed on the underside and railing, the tendrils snapped around, forming a weird, geometric, spiderweb-like connection between the individual pieces of the railing, before they hauled themselves over.</p>\\n<p>Our forward progress slowed.\\xa0 They were waiting for us, two of them climbing up the wall so they would be above us, the other standing on the stairs, tendrils wrapped around the railing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI can\\u2019t, I can\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary seized her hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe projects are down here.\\xa0 They\\u2019re not done,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy?\\xa0 Why haven\\u2019t you been able to finish these little bastards and give them to the academy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Academy-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No,</em>\\u201d I cut him off.\\xa0 \\u201cNo dilly-dallying, no shifting blame, no ego.\\xa0 What\\u2019s wrong with your work?\\xa0 Be straight, be fast, or we might die.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The doctor huffed.\\xa0 \\u201cControl.\\xa0 They go to the battlefield in boxes, yes?\\xa0 We use pheromone, drive them away, they run, far, to enemy camp.\\xa0 After time, or full belly, pheromone smell good, draws them back in.\\xa0 Straight to cage.\\xa0 Out, wait, back in.\\xa0 Every night, until the enemy breaks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut too unpredictable, Academy says.\\xa0 Do not move out in straight lines.\\xa0 The weapon is not devastating enough to be worth using without ability to aim.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The cloud of bugs below had stopped expanding, but they were now buzzing around in the darkness of the shaft, impossible to catch unless the light just happened to fall behind them in the right way.\\xa0 I felt one land on me, and decided on the usual approach for bees.\\xa0 Leave it alone and <em>hope</em>.</p>\\n<p>The small black creatures below us were crawling more aimlessly, grabbing and snapping for bugs.\\xa0 Their gums were black, but their teeth and tongues weren\\u2019t.\\xa0 The teeth weren\\u2019t white, though, but gnarled nubs, eroded, ill-cared for.\\xa0 It made the stark pinkness of their tongues all the more alarming.</p>\\n<p>Above us, one of the creatures stuck out its tongue.\\xa0 The member moved just like the tendrils did, snapping out, all right angles, without seeming rhyme or reason, clinging to a surface.\\xa0 In this case, the surface was the creature\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p>Those same tendrils would snap out all maze-like and unpredictable over their victim\\u2019s skin, they would cut, break down the exterior layer, and then recede, sawing in again.\\xa0 Shortly after, their skin would fall off in pretty patterns.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot any of the stuff?\\xa0 Pheromones?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not like what you describe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The cloud below was growing thicker, drawing closer, and I was <em>pretty</em> sure some of the little bastards below us had realized we were above them.</p>\\n<p>The ones that had crawled onto the wall above us were inching closer, tentative.\\xa0 Still, every little movement of their hands or feet prompted the tendrils to snap out and cling to the side of the wall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow.\\xa0 Do.\\xa0 You.\\xa0 Kill.\\xa0 Them?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFire.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe used all the fire.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen, we don\\u2019t kill, we disable.\\xa0 We\\u2026 if we can get to room with something we might rub on skin, affect taste, smell\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary gave Lillian a bit of a push.\\xa0 It seemed to get Lillian moving where she\\u2019d been shutting down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cH-Here,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>She set her bag down on the stair in front of her.\\xa0 She fumbled her way through it, hands shaking so badly that she couldn\\u2019t even reliably grab anything.</p>\\n<p>The scientist who had been filling us in on the creatures pushed her aside and began rummaging through it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere isn\\u2019t much left,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, no\\u2026 no.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t see\\u2026 no, not this, either.\\xa0 Even if we crushed it-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen moved, reaching out.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t a fast movement, but it was sudden enough that it made me jump.</p>\\n<p>One of the things above us had pounced.\\xa0 Its hands touched Helen\\u2019s arm, and the tendrils spread out, over and under the sleeve of her Academy jacket.</p>\\n<p>She caught it by the wrists, and pinned it down on the stairs beside her.\\xa0 The tendrils retracted, then snaked out again, as if trying to find an appropriate grip.</p>\\n<p>It was only after the third retraction and reapplication that beads of blood began to form on Helen\\u2019s face, neck, hands, and bare legs, tracing fine lines in those maze-like patterns.</p>\\n<p>Gordon found his way past the others, leaving Gladys behind, to get close.\\xa0 He raised his foot, prepared to step on the thing\\u2019s throat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No</em>,\\u201d Helen whispered the word.</p>\\n<p>Gordon backed away, touching the railing.</p>\\n<p>Helen had the thing\\u2019s gaze, and brought her face closer.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t flinch as its tongue snapped out to cover her face.</p>\\n<p>Instead, she leaned closer, mouth opening too wide, teeth bared, and <em>hissed.</em></p>\\n<p>Something in that flipped a primal switch in the black thing.\\xa0 It struggled, flailing, tendrils retracted, and kicked to try and get away.\\xa0 It squealed and snorted like a pig crossed with a baby all the while, a fear sound.</p>\\n<p>Helen ratcheted up the aggression, twisting the thing\\u2019s arms to inflict pain, her back arching, before she let it go.</p>\\n<p>It fled, and it fled with enough speed that its buddies joined it, our way now clear.</p>\\n<p>Helen composed herself as fast as she\\u2019d gone feral, one hand going to fix her hair at one side, where it had fallen across her face.\\xa0 She looked at us, her face now running with blood, smiled, and made a pleased little half-giggle sound in her throat, before leading the way upstairs.</p>\\n<p>She was most <em>definitely</em> doing that routine on purpose, just to freak people out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHer skin,\\u201d the scientist said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf she moves too fast, too quickly-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHer skin is different,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He helped Lillian gather up her bag and the contents that had been pulled out, then grabbed her arm, helping pull her forward.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>She\\u2019s </em>different,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cObviously enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t miss the fractional hesitation before the others followed the Lambs on the way upstairs.\\xa0 Logic dictated that we were less dangerous, but a trace of fear and concern had held them back for just a moment.</p>\\n<p>Far below us, Gorger was forced out of the tunnel.\\xa0 He was a massive creature, and the stairs weren\\u2019t wide.\\xa0 His grip on the railing was born of many years of practice, as he swung himself down.\\xa0 He found some foothold and flung himself clear across the shaft, to plunge a hand into a handhold that was impossible for human eyes to make out in the darkness.</p>\\n<p>He hung there, a vague pale shape in the gloom, seemingly suspended by nothing.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa emerged from the corridor.\\xa0 She was <em>different.</em></p>\\n<p>Hunch-backed, she had two heads, and one of the metal spikes jutted out from the \\u2018sleeve\\u2019 of her robe, behind her actual hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat the\\u2026\\u201d I breathed out the words.</p>\\n<p>She turned her head away from Gorger, scanning the surroundings.\\xa0 Her face was still damaged.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t <em>healing</em> any of the damage we\\u2019d done, though it looked like a clotted mess from a distance.\\xa0 It was essentially what Jamie had said: whatever else happened, the Sub Rosa cocoon kept the brain more or less operational and the heart pumping.\\xa0 If she could die of blood loss, she hadn\\u2019t yet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s sharing the suit,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhatever she released killed her underlings, or left them unable to fight, so she made room.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked again, noting the hump at her back.</p>\\n<p>But the arm\\u2026 her arm was longer than it should have been, and yet, with the hump at her back, somehow the blade reached out that far?</p>\\n<p><em>She dislocated it.\\xa0 Took it to pieces, stretched everything out, and then bound the hand to her wrist.</em></p>\\n<p>And just like the suit was keeping her alive, if the mechanisms or biological parts of what made the convicts electric were still in operation\\u2026</p>\\n<p>Poor bastard was probably alive in there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBugs,\\u201d Mary said, interrupting my train of thought.\\xa0 \\u201cI got bit, what\\u2019s going to happen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStung, not bit,\\u201d Gordon\\u2019s new beau replied.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 The payloads are mild, for testing purposes with animals, but, I don\\u2019t know how to put this, you\\u2019re small?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gorger leaped across the considerable gap between the wall and the stair where Sub Rosa was.\\xa0 He grabbed onto the frame of the gate that marked the entrance to the sixth floor tunnels, and avoided collapsing the stairs, sliding into the tunnel, an arm extended for Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA little toxin goes a little further,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>A moment passed, and Gorger stumbled back, grunting in pain.</p>\\n<p>He could crush her so easily, if he could get to her, but\\u2026 something was wrong.\\xa0 The shock of the metal spike bypassed the rest of the immunities and protections he\\u2019d been built with.\\xa0 His reaction seemed very human, a flinch, a recoiling.</p>\\n<p>We were rising high enough that I was losing my ability to pick out details.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 If it forms a bump on your skin, it\\u2019s anaesthetic, it\\u2019ll numb, maybe partially paralyze.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it doesn\\u2019t?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen it\\u2019s tranquilizer,\\u201d Shipman\\u2019s partner told us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s good?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBad,\\u201d Gladys Shipman told us.\\xa0 \\u201cTranquilizer, applied without adhering to the ratios?\\xa0 One bug, a grown adult might feel woozy.\\xa0 For you?\\xa0 Or even the boy with the glasses there?\\xa0 I\\u2019d be worried it might depress your heart rate too much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDeath,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPossibly.\\xa0 And there are an awful lot of the bugs around,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo many years of work, scattered to the wind,\\u201d her partner said.</p>\\n<p><em>I\\u2019m more concerned about dying</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow long?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cBefore we see bumps, or effects?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot long.\\xa0 Minutes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon seemed to make a decision, hearing that.\\xa0 He pointed to the next set of tunnels.</p>\\n<p><em>We\\u2019ll get cornered again</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>The thought had to be pushed aside.\\xa0 I knew why he was suggesting it.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t argue.</p>\\n<p>We made our way into the tunnel, and then people gathered inside the first available lab.\\xa0 Our \\u2018help\\u2019, including Gladys Shipman\\u2019s partner or supervisor.\\xa0 Whoever the older woman was.</p>\\n<p>I could hear the furniture being moved before we reached our destination.\\xa0 Two labs over, the door was ajar, the lab empty.\\xa0 Us younger folk gathered inside.</p>\\n<p>We shut the door.</p>\\n<p><em>Time to see who gets knocked out, who dies, and maybe come up with a plan.</em></p>\\n<p>Lillian immediately set to looking after Helen, who cooperated remarkably little.\\xa0 A wet cloth passed over her face, and came away crimson.</p>\\n<p>A lot of blood, but it wasn\\u2019t from one clear source.\\xa0 It was beads of blood adding up to a veritable pool.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe should all check each other over,\\u201d Shipman told us.\\xa0 \\u201cBetter to find out now than later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Removing my jacket, actually Jamie\\u2019s that he\\u2019d lent me, I draped it over the back of a chair.</p>\\n<p>I saw Jamie point.</p>\\n<p>Two marks at my elbow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt didn\\u2019t even hurt,\\u201d I said, quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe marketed them to the Academy as weapons, but we designed them to be a means of vaccinating people en masse,\\u201d Shipman said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt was supposed to be a good thing, or a neutral thing.\\xa0 Help the people who needed it, without hurting them.\\xa0 Are there bumps?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s hope,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>But I nodded while secure in the knowledge that I\\u2019d been among the first the bugs had reached.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been at the tail end of the group, the first available target.</p>\\n<p>The bumps had had enough time to appear.</p>\\n<p>There were parts of our bodies we couldn\\u2019t check ourselves.\\xa0 Jamie looked me over, as I pulled my shirt up over my head, then lifted up my trouser legs, and found another on my thigh.\\xa0 We finished by having him run his hands through my hair.</p>\\n<p>I finished and pulled my clothing back into place.\\xa0 Gordon had been mirroring my actions, so Jamie could check us both at once, but the hair took more time.\\xa0 The look seemed cursory, but I trusted Jamie\\u2019s eyes.</p>\\n<p>He was faster with Gordon than it had been with me.\\xa0 Those eyes learned fast.</p>\\n<p>I could see how some parts of Gordon were ever so slightly different in tone.\\xa0 Where most people saw, it was normal, impossible to notice, except for maybe a hair of difference in tone from one hand to the next.</p>\\n<p>Gordon had gotten off easy in that respect.\\xa0 I had too, though I had suspicions.</p>\\n<p>Jamie, though\\u2026</p>\\n<p>I looked at him.\\xa0 I expected a flinch, a downward glance, and I saw neither.</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you want someone else,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s doable.\\xa0 I won\\u2019t mind.\\xa0 Lillian\\u2019s seen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian is busy with Helen,\\u201d he said, voice soft.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was powdering Helen\\u2019s skin with something she\\u2019d collected from the shelf.\\xa0 It was tan in color and fine in grit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou really need better taste in makeup,\\u201d Helen was heard to comment.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShut up,\\u201d Lillian retorted, with a little more emphasis than necessary.\\xa0 On edge, but she had something constructive to do.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019d rather have Sy?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>I worked quickly, my body positioned to block the view from the other side of the room.</p>\\n<p>He pulled up his shirt, and I saw the tracks of scars, the largest and deepest running in parallel with his spine.\\xa0 Smaller ones reached out, like branches from a tree, gnarled, puckered, angry.</p>\\n<p>There was a knot at the base of his neck, gnarled, lopsided.</p>\\n<p>He turned around, and I saw how the scars reached around to embrace him, and the healing had been poor.\\xa0 It had gotten infected, I knew, and there had been other priorities than getting the tissue to heal perfectly.</p>\\n<p>Helen had been grown from scratch.\\xa0 Whatever she looked like, there was precious little in her that was exactly like the human equivalent, from her hair to her skin to her internal organs or muscular structure, or even the composition of her muscles.</p>\\n<p>Jamie had been born human, but they\\u2019d decided to make modifications.\\xa0 It had involved removing part of his spine and brain, cloning the spine and brain with augmentations, and then replacing them.</p>\\n<p>While Gordon, Helen and I had been playing \\u2018naughty and nice\\u2019, getting to know each other, Jamie had been lying face down on a table in a sterile environment, conscious enough to converse, waiting to see if things would take when everything was put back into place, or if he\\u2019d be paralyzed and lobotomized, if he lived at all.</p>\\n<p>Helen was vat-grown, Jamie had received a graft.</p>\\n<p>Weeks.\\xa0 Maybe months.\\xa0 He\\u2019d never specified.</p>\\n<p>I pulled his shirt down for him, pulled at the back of his pants to check his rear, glancing at the second of the gnarled scar points at the tailbone, then replaced them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can check my front,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I ran my hand up the back of his neck, along the scar that his long hair helped hide, and into his hair.</p>\\n<p>Something told me the physical contact was important.\\xa0 Maybe it was how he loosened the deathgrip on his book a fraction.</p>\\n<p>I combed his hair with my fingers, searching with my eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo stings,\\u201d I said, my hand still on his head, hair between my fingers.</p>\\n<p>He nodded against my hand.</p>\\n<p>I mussed up his hair, then pulled away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he said, the statement far enough removed from the deed that it had a different meaning.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course,\\u201d I replied.</p>\\n<p>The girls were done faster than we were, but Helen required a fair bit of powder.\\xa0 Lillian, showing that canniness that lurked beneath the surface, had done Helen\\u2019s legs and the parts that clothes covered, and had only the hands left.\\xa0 Helen looked like a ghastly doll, now, the sort of doll that was left by the side of the road, scuffed by weather and being kicked around.\\xa0 Paint flecking off, scuff marks buried under that same paint, covered in muck that was assuredly blood and dirt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHere we are,\\u201d Gordon said, as Lillian continued her ministrations.\\xa0 \\u201cSy\\u2019s stung.\\xa0 So am I, but I think it\\u2019s mostly anaesthetic, and I\\u2019m pretty tough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m stung too,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian\\u2019s already feeling woozy, but she\\u2019s knuckling through.\\xa0 Gladys has two stings on the legs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.\\xa0 Her jaw was clenched.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m fine,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t think they like me enough to sting me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cToo sweet for them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She flashed me a ghastly-doll smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe situation is bad,\\u201d Gordon mused.\\xa0 \\u201cWhatever Sy was telling the big guy, they aren\\u2019t going to open things up again until Gorger gives the signal, and I don\\u2019t think Gorger <em>can.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The memory of the tranquility I\\u2019d experienced at Sub Rosa\\u2019s hands was still uncomfortable, ominous, and alluring.\\xa0 I\\u2019d already stated my concerns with being in a locked room, thinking that our escaped experiment could come through at any moment.\\xa0 I wanted to be doing something <em>proactive</em>.</p>\\n<p>Talking and planning was good, but it wasn\\u2019t quite good enough.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said she deserved it,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe monster?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gladys made a face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s to blame for the worst parts of the Academy?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a long story,\\u201d Gladys said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure we have time before things start taking effect.\\xa0 I\\u2019m already\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She paused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStart sooner,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Gordon scowled at me for that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s complicated, it\\u2019s not something I can sum up quickly,\\u201d Gladys said.</p>\\n<p><em>If I had my knife, I would hold it to your throat and make you talk, Gordon be damned.\\xa0 Stop stalling!</em></p>\\n<p>I smiled, waiting patiently.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe was rigorous.\\xa0 Ruthless in deciding who got labs and who had their projects canceled early.\\xa0 It was all about the end result.\\xa0 Nothing to do with the process, didn\\u2019t matter if you were sick or had a death in the family, if your wife was in the delivery room, you were expected to give your all, or she would replace you with someone who would.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ah.</p>\\n<p>In a way, the foundation of the philosophy that had made <em>us</em> so hard to sell.</p>\\n<p>That philosophy had meant it had taken nearly four years for Hayle to get <em>one</em> of the failed Lamb projects restarted.</p>\\n<p>I hated Sub Rosa a little, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think, <em>my uncle</em> thinks-\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Thought</em>.\\xa0 She\\u2019d forgotten the details in the heat of the moment.\\xa0 Death was like that.\\xa0 We spent so long assuming people were alive.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-That she liked having new projects.\\xa0 Old projects, ones that were brought in from elsewhere, she pressured them.\\xa0 Replaced them with things that were <em>hers</em>.\\xa0 When she couldn\\u2019t do that anymore, she put pressure on everyone, demanded more results, faster.\\xa0 She got them, which pleased the people in charge, but things down here reached a breaking point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat broke?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStandards.\\xa0 Ethics.\\xa0 People started taking shortcuts.\\xa0 Cheating.\\xa0 There was a month, when I was young, that my uncle was home for all of it.\\xa0 Because some people got desperate, and they got test subjects from Radham.\\xa0 Not the Academy, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe city,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven children,\\u201d Gladys said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy uncle was so torn up about it\\u2026 <em>friends</em> of his, they did it.\\xa0 Starting with the elderly, but then\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gladys drifted, nearly nodding off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat happened in the end?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe fell over the railing, straight down to the bottom of the shaft.\\xa0 She was on a lower level, but\\u2026 it was enough.\\xa0 Or almost enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBefore we go further or run out of time, the bugs, same question we asked about the nightmare creatures,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy isn\\u2019t it in use?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were close.\\xa0 We designed the mechanism, we were waiting on a breeding phase to see how effectively it carried across generations.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Absently, my fingers brushed over the two red blotches on my arm.\\xa0 No bumps.\\xa0 I felt my leg, and didn\\u2019t feel any raised bump.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo flaws?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot enough for us to use, and I\\u2019ve been thinking about it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He flashed her a smile.\\xa0 \\u201cGood job, then.\\xa0 Keep thinking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was something in his expression that I might have taken for lovesickness, but he wasn\\u2019t <em>that</em> bad.\\xa0 Even his plan to shoot Sub Rosa hadn\\u2019t been terrible.\\xa0 We\\u2019d been particularly unlucky, that she hadn\\u2019t gone down with six bullets, and that Gorger had shown up.\\xa0 Had either one been different, Gordon would have been the hero.</p>\\n<p>The hero that didn\\u2019t <em>communicate</em>, but eh.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re acting drunk,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m just a <em>little</em> tranquilized,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m feeling it, I\\u2019ll deal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGorger can\\u2019t do anything.\\xa0 Jamie, can you think about any projects we could use?\\xa0 Places we could go?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been trying, nothing springs to mind, and I have things pretty organized in my head for the job we\\u2019ve been doing down here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.</p>\\n<p>A slow, lazy nod.</p>\\n<p>Worse than before.</p>\\n<p>I bit my tongue, watching the conversation continue.\\xa0 Lillian was holding her hand, which had formed a palsied sort of fist, but she was drifting away too.</p>\\n<p>The conversation was sporadic, and it wasn\\u2019t <em>my</em> focus that was faltering.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCover your skin with something caustic,\\u201d Gladys was saying.\\xa0 \\u201cWasn\\u2019t a bad idea.\\xa0 It\\u2019ll hurt, but it\\u2019ll keep the bugs off, but it\\u2019ll hurt\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I watched in quiet silence as she faded away, slumbering.</p>\\n<p>When Lillian, Mary and Gladys nodded off entirely, I forced myself to face the reality.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Gordon, who was going down the same path.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou-\\u201d he slurred the word.\\xa0 \\u201cDamnashin.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t stay here and wait and hope,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cCan\\u2019t fight eever.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEither,\\u201d Jamie corrected.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYush,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>And he was out.</p>\\n<p>A full minute passed in silence, Jamie, Helen and I with our sleeping companions.\\xa0 I knew they were doing what I was doing.\\xa0 Watching to make sure everyone kept breathing.</p>\\n<p>I found a handhold and helped myself to my feet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were stung three times,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, probably,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut my casefile was the <em>Wyvern</em> for a reason, and it\\u2019s not the parallel with my own name.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI <em>know,</em>\\u201d Jamie said, sounding a little annoyed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet me have this,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>He snorted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Wyvern is the dragon with a barbed tail.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been stung every month for years.\\xa0 Everything under the sun put into my body.\\xa0 I have tolerances.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>We looked between us.</p>\\n<p>Helen, Jamie and I.</p>\\n<p>The three of us were probably the <em>least</em> well equipped to handle Sub Rosa, in the grand scheme of it all.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s find something to rub on ourselves to drive off the bugs, and see what we can do,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s hope things haven\\u2019t gotten too much worse while we\\u2019ve been distracted.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/05/23/lips-sealed-3-2/\"><strong>Next</strong></a></p>\\n<p>The room flooded with light.\\xa0 I opened my eyes just enough to glimpse Gordon sanding there, curtains in hand.\\xa0 He was wearing a white Academy uniform, minus the jacket.\\xa0 He took his time, tying each curtain back with the ribbons that were hooked into the wall.\\xa0 Past the rain-streaked window, the trees and the leafy branches on buildings were a breadth of colors; mostly red and red-black for the buildings.\\xa0 The color green was all but gone from the view.</p>\\n<p>I pulled the covers over my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUp,\\u201d he said, tearing the covers off me in one sweep.\\xa0 \\u201cMary can\\u2019t wake you up every day, much as you\\u2019d like her to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut I don\\u2019t want to go to school!\\u201d I groaned, pulling the pillow over my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOrders.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t care about orders!\\xa0 I\\u2019m the black sheep of the lambs, the rebel, the villain!\\xa0 I can play hooky!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re coming,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll drag you along in your pyjamas if I have to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d make it work,\\u201d I mumbled into my pillow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m betting you\\u2019d revel in it.\\xa0 But you\\u2019d stand out, and we\\u2019re already on shaky ground there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I moved the pillow and looked at him, \\u201cYou\\u2019d sabotage the project?\\xa0 Reveal us for what we are?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He looked very casual, leaning on the footboard at the end of Jamie\\u2019s empty, neatly-made bed.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t flinch at the question, but instead asked, \\u201cAren\\u2019t you already doing that, trying to skip out on this job?\\xa0 Professor Briggs said he\\u2019d make use of us.\\xa0 He followed through on his word.\\xa0 <em>This</em> is our assignment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t think he meant <em>this</em>!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s so horribly, awfully, agonizingly <em>boring</em>!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt has to end soon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNuh uh!\\u201d I said, flipping over and sitting up a bit.\\xa0 \\u201cWe finish and, oh, guess what?\\xa0 We have to start over!\\xa0 He\\u2019s sinking the project and he\\u2019s trying to keep a leash on us.\\xa0 This pointless busywork is exactly that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t say pointless,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you\\u2019re not going to get up because of the project, how about getting up because you don\\u2019t want to look like a baby in front of Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Baby</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can play head games too, Sy.\\xa0 If you want to whine and throw a tantrum-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFirst of all, that\\u2019s not a good head game, if I know you\\u2019re playing me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019ll work,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSecond of all, I\\u2019m not throwing tantrums, you <em>dick</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not acting like an adult, either.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah?\\xa0 Are you sure?\\xa0 Because I think a lot of adults groan and moan behind closed doors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you really think those hypothetical adults are the ones you want to turn to as role models?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEspecially considering that you\\u2019re a sponge when it comes to that sort of thing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes!\\xa0 Because the alternative is ending up a tightwad who doesn\\u2019t know how to express himself or have fun,\\u201d I said, giving him a pointed look.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I live to be an adult, then I want to be the kind of adult who skips work and goes and gets drunk and knows how to enjoy the good with all the rest of the murky, bleary day-to-day garbage.\\xa0 I want to do work that\\u2019s exciting and interesting and <em>me</em>.\\xa0 Not <em>this</em> kind of work!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are times when I don\\u2019t understand you at all,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I do know that you don\\u2019t want to look like a baby in front of Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop saying that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs it getting to you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I lied.</p>\\n<p>The look he gave me told me he knew I was fibbing.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t at my best first thing in the day.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou and I both know you\\u2019re going to get out of bed, you\\u2019re just stalling at this point.\\xa0 You have three seconds before I head down to the breakfast table and casually mention that you\\u2019re being a brat and a baby.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s dirty.\\xa0 I\\u2019m going to get you back for this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI mean it.\\xa0 I will get you.\\xa0 <em>Today</em>, even.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I swung my legs over the side of the bed, bringing them down to the floor and standing in the same motion.</p>\\n<p>When he didn\\u2019t react, I flourished a little.</p>\\n<p>He gave me a short round of clapping, though his expression didn\\u2019t change. \\u201cCome on.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t trust you not to go back to bed if I leave you alone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I grumbled, but I went with.\\xa0 He clapped a hand on my back as I walked beside him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hate it too,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you don\\u2019t hate it enough to do something about it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m patient.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s been three months.\\xa0 Three!\\xa0 This is the worst job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLife is short!\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I belatedly realized what I\\u2019d said.\\xa0 I bit my tongue, literally, with enough force that I might have drawn blood.</p>\\n<p>But he didn\\u2019t get angry, and he <em>had</em> gotten angry in the past, when I\\u2019d said similar things.\\xa0 He only sighed out the words, \\u201cI know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t respond, but clapped a hand on my back instead.</p>\\n<p>We reached the dining room.\\xa0 Even with two tables, we couldn\\u2019t seat everyone at once.\\xa0 What tended to happen was that the older kids looked after the youngest, who were given something simple and quick to eat, then moved along with something they could carry with them as they ate.\\xa0 In the summer, the place of choice was often outside, under the eaves.\\xa0 Now that it was getting cooler, only a few went out, and the rest were relegated to the stairs and front hall, where dropped bits of toast and fruit were easiest to clean up.</p>\\n<p>The good stuff was available on a first-come, first-serve basis, which meant I rarely got any bacon or grilled tree jerky.</p>\\n<p>Jamie, Helen, and Mary were already seated when we arrived at the table.\\xa0 Jamie and Mary were looking after the little ones.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s long hair was wet, combed and parted, and he had drops of water on his glasses, and he was still wearing his pyjamas.\\xa0 Mary was wearing a cardigan over her nightgown, hair tied back with one ribbon.</p>\\n<p>Helen, both washed and dressed, like Gordon, was generally disqualified from the breakfast duties.\\xa0 None of the kids were privy to who or what we were, but somehow, by some clue or cue that I couldn\\u2019t figure out, the littlest kids had a way of reacting to Helen like a rabbit might react to a swooping hawk.\\xa0 If she tried to urge them to eat, they tended to stop doing anything but acting nervous and focusing on her.\\xa0 She often helped watch the food or turn over the toast, instead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re up,\\u201d Mrs. Earles greeted me.\\xa0 The food on the stove was only being kept warm, and her focus was more on cleaning up than anything else.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood morning, Mrs. Earles,\\u201d I said, still half asleep.\\xa0 \\u201cI didn\\u2019t get a chance to say last night, but I think your haircut looks nice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou got your hair cut?\\u201d Rick asked, twisting around on his bench.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust a trim,\\u201d Mrs. Earles said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd it was very kind of Sylvester to notice and say so.\\xa0 That doesn\\u2019t mean I\\u2019m going to turn the stove back on to cook him some bacon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEarly bird gets the bacon,\\u201d Rick told me, in the most smug manner possible.</p>\\n<p><em>Fat bird arrives early enough for the bacon and takes up table space until everyone else is done.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWasn\\u2019t trying for bacon.\\xa0 Just saying,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I collected a bowl and plate, holding them out.\\xa0 \\u201cOatmeal?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOatmeal,\\u201d Mrs. Earles said, plopping a too-generous helping into my bowl.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFruit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFruit,\\u201d she said, using a ladle to deposit mystery fruit on my plate.\\xa0 Something from the Academy that they were trying on the public of Radham.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToast.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToast,\\u201d she said, reaching over to the side of the oven to grab the long-handled wire setup that had toast trapped within its lattice.\\xa0 She popped the wire configuration open and dumped the toast onto my plate.</p>\\n<p>Boring food for a boring day.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, Mrs. Earles,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWork hard today,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I gave her a weak smile.</p>\\n<p>I sat down with the others, making a smaller kid scoot over to give me more room, so I wasn\\u2019t forced to take the spot next to Rick.</p>\\n<p>Mary was sitting beside Helen, and didn\\u2019t seem to remember that she was supposed to be afraid of the girl.\\xa0 Things were bound to go one of two ways as time passed, with Mary\\u2019s fear of Helen escalating or dissipating, and it was perhaps a testament to Mary\\u2019s character that she\\u2019d found a way to take it in stride.\\xa0 Her focus was more on Ally, a six years old who was staunchly refusing to eat her oatmeal.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEat fast,\\u201d I chimed in.\\xa0 \\u201cIt only gets grosser if you let it get cold.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt <em>is</em> cold, and it <em>is</em> gross,\\u201d Ally told me, which I\\u2019d expected.</p>\\n<p>I rose up from my seat a little, peered over, and checked her bowl.\\xa0 I stole it from her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Mrs Earles said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo tricks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I spooned most of my oatmeal over into Ally\\u2019s bowl, then gave her what was left of mine, still hot, noticeably less than she\\u2019d had before.\\xa0 I passed it back to her, then looked at Mrs. Earles, waiting.</p>\\n<p>She huffed out a sigh, then went back to cleaning dishes.</p>\\n<p>It was the perfect response, because I could look at Ally and give the girl a wink.</p>\\n<p>It was clear that she didn\\u2019t want to eat, but in this small battle of kid versus adult, I\\u2019d sided with her.\\xa0 She couldn\\u2019t refuse now without betraying the covenant of kids everywhere.</p>\\n<p>Still, she was noticeably sullen as she took to shoveling the oatmeal into her mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReady to face the day?\\u201d Mary asked, now that she was free of her charge.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre <em>you</em>?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>She made a disgusted face, tongue sticking out.\\xa0 I smirked, then set to eating, mixing the cold oatmeal in with the hot.</p>\\n<p>It was pretty quiet as mornings went.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t the only one that was feeling a general weariness.\\xa0 It was visible in Jamie, in Mary, in Gordon to a small degree, and even in Helen; Helen wasn\\u2019t putting a lot of energy into acting.\\xa0 She\\u2019d slipped back to her default: smiling, cheery, <em>coy</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI believe <em>I</em> was the one that mentioned Mrs. Earles\\u2019 haircut to you last night,\\u201d Jamie commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDid you tell her?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJoint effort, then,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMrs. Earles?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, Sylvester?\\u201d she asked, sounding way too tired for the early hour of the day.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie likes your hair too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you Jamie,\\u201d she said, in a way that made it sound routine.\\xa0 More for the benefit of the littler kids than anything else.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201cSee?\\xa0 <em>Teamwork</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he said, but he rolled his eyes.</p>\\n<p>I ate quick, but as one of the last to the table \\u2013 Gordon had already eaten before waking me up \\u2013 I was still one of the last to finish.\\xa0 Ally finished her oatmeal, which freed Mary to head upstairs to wash and change, with Helen and Jamie a few steps behind.\\xa0 I\\u2019d timed things well enough that I could go up with them.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Rick, who was still seated.\\xa0 The look he gave me was a curious one.\\xa0 Not the usual.</p>\\n<p>Something had changed.\\xa0 He was <em>studying </em>me, and I didn\\u2019t know why.</p>\\n<p>I shivered.</p>\\n<p>We passed Gordon, who was working to manage the kids and help Mrs. Earles.\\xa0 It would probably be my turn tomorrow, and sleeping in wouldn\\u2019t be an option.\\xa0 Blah.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look nice too, Mary,\\u201d I commented, quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI haven\\u2019t even washed up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven so,\\u201d I said, shrugging.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou too, Helen, of course, but that\\u2019s only natural, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen gave me a warm, coy smile that made me shiver in a less-good way.\\xa0 Then, to make me more uncomfortable, she added,\\xa0 \\u201cNaturally.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie gave me a curious look.\\xa0 I nearly missed Helen taking Mary\\u2019s hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s wash up, and I\\u2019ll brush your hair for you,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>The look on Mary\\u2019s face suggested she wasn\\u2019t <em>entirely</em> used to Helen yet.\\xa0 She said, \\u201cI can do it myself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease.\\xa0 I get so bored doing my own hair,\\u201d Helen said, pleading.\\xa0 \\u201cI want to do yours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>You don\\u2019t get bored at all.\\xa0 I know for a fact that you can sit and stare at a wall for hours without a problem</em>.</p>\\n<p>Mary had to know the same thing.\\xa0 She gave me a helpless look, but all I could do was shrug.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I headed to our room, leaving Mary to be dragged to the girl\\u2019s washroom by Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have no idea what\\u2019s going on,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGirls are scary,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m <em>pretty</em> sure that it\\u2019s only those two.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We reached the room, and I went to close the curtains that Gordon had opened because of me.\\xa0 Idly, I mentioned, \\u201cOkay, I don\\u2019t want this to be taken the wrong way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo I do that?\\xa0 Take things the wrong way?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 You\\u2019re good about that.\\xa0 But you do get weird about some stuff.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWeird.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Say or ask me whatever you\\u2019re thinking, and I\\u2019ll try not to get weird about it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wish I was a girl.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook at what Helen does.\\xa0 It\\u2019s so much easier to manipulate people.\\xa0 So many more levels of nuance and ways to abuse people\\u2019s expectation of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh.\\xa0 You do that well enough as a boy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd if I was a girl, I\\u2019d be going to the girl\\u2019s washroom right now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAhhhh, that\\u2019s what you were getting at.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could protect Mary from Helen, and I\\u2019d be closer to her.\\xa0 Lillian\\u2019s close to her, and Helen\\u2019s getting closer to being a real friend of Mary\\u2019s.\\xa0 It\\u2019s\\u2026 what\\u2019s the word for building a relationship through closeness?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPropinquity?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure.\\xa0 Propinquity.\\xa0 That\\u2019s why I think I\\u2019d want to be a girl.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne of these days, Sy\\u2026\\u201d he said, trailing off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said you wouldn\\u2019t get weird!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not getting weird.\\xa0 I\\u2019m trying to decide if I should pity or fear the person you\\u2019re going to be in a few years.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPity or fear,\\u201d I said, snorting.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ll feel friendship, because we\\u2019ll be <em>friends</em>.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll be <em>together</em>.\\xa0 What\\u2019s to pity or fear?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re assuming we survive that long,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd no, that\\u2019s not an excuse for you to tell me when my time is supposed to be up.\\xa0 I won\\u2019t ask until Gordon does.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI <em>guarantee</em> you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou and I, together.\\xa0 You\\u2019re my best friend.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave Jamie his space, keeping my back turned, while he got dressed.\\xa0 Reaching into the wardrobe, I pulled out two Academy uniforms on hangers.\\xa0 Both were badly wrinkled, and one was stained with blood.\\xa0 I started measuring the two to figure out which one was most wearable.</p>\\n<p>Cloth rustled against my hand.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t look, but felt it, then seized it.</p>\\n<p>Jamie had passed me <em>his</em> spare uniform.\\xa0 Unwrinkled and clean.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMight be a little big, but it\\u2019s gotta be better than <em>that</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThanks,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cBest friends, right?\\xa0 Or chalk it up to teamwork.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>White shirt with the Radham emblem on the lapel and sleeve, light gray uniform jacket, dark gray pants.\\xa0 Socks, shoes.</p>\\n<p>Same as I\\u2019d worn six days a week for months.</p>\\n<p>I fished my badge out of one pocket, a silver etching of Radham\\u2019s coat of arms, backed by a black piece of leather, connected by a buckle at the top so it could flip up.\\xa0 Both sides of the leather were marked by a script, though general wear and tear had made it hard to read.\\xa0 Clearance to do what I needed to do</p>\\n<p>The badge went in a pocket, out of sight.</p>\\n<p>When we were done, we stepped back out into the hallway, where we waited for Gordon, Helen, and Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not suited for this,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cUniforms, schedules, <em>routine.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMake a game of it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve made so many games of it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve made <em>games</em> about the games I\\u2019ve made of it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what to say.\\xa0 I feel like you\\u2019re buttering us up.\\xa0 You\\u2019re being too <em>nice.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m trying not to be an asshole,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 I had to choose my words carefully to avoid letting details slip to an overhearing ear.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m so god-damned tired of this thing we\\u2019re doing at the Academy.\\xa0 I\\u2019m cranky and I\\u2019m feeling spiteful, and it\\u2019s almost that time of the month.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie snorted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor my <em>appointment,</em>\\u201d I whispered.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd after my appointment I\\u2019m going to be <em>worse</em>.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t take much more of this.\\xa0 Something\\u2019s going to break, or give, or <em>something</em>.\\xa0 I want to make sure I\\u2019ve established who my friends are before it happens.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He reached up and put his hand on my head, mussing up my hair, side-to-side.\\xa0 I let my head rock with the motion.</p>\\n<p>The girls emerged, radiant in white, Mary with her hair done up in a slightly different style, two thin braids reaching behind her head, where they met and were tied into place with a ribbon, trailing down at the back.\\xa0 The rest of her hair was brushed straight.\\xa0 She was smiling in a way I hadn\\u2019t expected.\\xa0 Whatever magic Helen had worked, this was above and beyond.\\xa0 Mary looked like an entirely different person, from an emotional standpoint.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLooks nice,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She leaned close to Jamie and I, smiling all the while as she whispered, \\u201cWe figured out how to hide knives in there.\\xa0 Can you even see them?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, as Jamie shook his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou would not <em>believe</em> how many weapons I\\u2019m carrying right now,\\u201d she said, smiling like the cat with the canary.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and I glanced at each other.\\xa0 I knew we were thinking the same thing, an echo of our earlier conversation.</p>\\n<p><em>Girls are scary.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p>Lillian met us at the entrance to the Bowels.\\xa0 She was holding a small stack of files.\\xa0 Without a word, she joined our rank and file, handing the files to Gordon.</p>\\n<p>We descended the stairs into the more dangerous laboratories of the Academy.\\xa0 Gordon passed one file back to us.\\xa0 \\u201cYou do one, we do one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho\\u2019s you and we?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou and Jamie go with Sy.\\xa0 Helen, Lillian and I work on this one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Odd, that he\\u2019d put me together with Mary and Jamie.\\xa0 Was he going easy on me?\\xa0 Did he sense that I was close to my limit?\\xa0 Suggesting I join up with the people I got along with best?</p>\\n<p><em>Good guy, that Gordon.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo-eighteen,\\u201d he said, pointing off to one side.\\xa0 Two floors deep.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll be in Three-twelve,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Our groups parted.</p>\\n<p>We descended another floor, then went to find the right lab.</p>\\n<p>Mary knocked on the door.</p>\\n<p>The man who answered wore a grey coat, and had a patch of skin on his face that was paler than the rest, with a frost-like pattern to how it was discolored and no hair growth on that part of his head, just above and behind the ear.\\xa0 I was pretty sure that it was from a few decades back, when they were still experimenting with new skin growth.\\xa0 When I\\u2019d had my skin melted off with the Snake Charmer\\u2019s special venom, I\\u2019d had the newest kind, and it had been uncomfortable for days.\\xa0 This guy would be that uncomfortable for the rest of his life, very probably.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know you,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou do?\\u201d Mary asked, surprised.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWord\\u2019s getting around.\\xa0 The <em>audit.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere\\u2019d <em>you</em> get the word about this audit?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cOr that we were the ones doing it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cI can\\u2019t name names.\\xa0 But you can\\u2019t expect to interview every single notable staff member and project team leader without someone letting something reach the wrong ear.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 Well, that took any potential fun we might have out of this.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve even heard that you\\u2019re a special project yourselves,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t give a tell, and I knew Mary wouldn\\u2019t either, but he still smiled as if we\\u2019d given something away.\\xa0 Jamie?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow does that work?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cAre we supposed to be killing machines?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve heard you\\u2019re adults in kid\\u2019s bodies.\\xa0 To catch people off guard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Well, they\\u2019re wrong, but that\\u2019s still a really bad sign</em>.</p>\\n<p>I spoke up, \\u201cAre you going to tell us who you heard that from?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cOddly enough, I don\\u2019t think I can remember.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Very odd,\\u201d I said, suppressing a sigh.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s stupid.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStupid, huh?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s really, really stupid.\\xa0 It sounds like you don\\u2019t even know how the Academy works.\\xa0 Funding experimental kids.\\xa0 Is that why they think you\\u2019re doing something wrong in that lab of yours?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The table was successfully turned.\\xa0 Patchy frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cMy work is exemplary.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been supported every step of the way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExemplary,\\u201d Jamie said, while writing in his notebook, more slowly than usual.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShow us?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>The man nodded.\\xa0 He invited us in.</p>\\n<p>It smelled like a barn inside, which probably wasn\\u2019t a bad way of putting it.\\xa0 The lab was one of the larger ones, but iron bars blocked off one side from the other.\\xa0 On <em>our</em> side, there were tables and notebooks, slates with equations and notes written out in chalk, and a full set of <em>Ratios by Species</em>.</p>\\n<p>On the <em>other</em> side, the experiment lurched.\\xa0 It was five-legged, unbalanced, it had no less than ten heads.\\xa0 The body was patchwork, some areas feathered, some furred, some scaled.\\xa0 With every movement, it made a hoarse whine, or a high pitched growl.\\xa0 It was hard to say.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t look very viable,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot\\u2026 viable,\\u201d Jamie echoed me, penning it down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHold on,\\u201d Patches said.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you even grasp the very basics of what we\\u2019re doing here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm, <em>yeah</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Then I added a lie for good measure, \\u201c<em>Our</em> project, like all the other groups going around, is to summarize <em>your</em> projects, take notes, and do reports on them for class.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>When what we\\u2019re really doing is scouring the university for Mauer\\u2019s moles and spies.\\xa0 Investigating and interviewing </em><em>every single damn person who might know something Mauer might be able to use or pass on</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>Checking ten to twenty a day, out of thousands of relevant doctors, teachers, students, and staff members.\\xa0 Six days a week, for three months.</em></p>\\n<p><em>We\\u2019d only caught one.</em></p>\\n<p><em>This is my personal hell</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m talking about method,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt starts with a goal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaking a weapon,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>The doctor gave her a very condescending look.\\xa0 I prickled a little at that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Patches said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s one option.\\xa0 It\\u2019s an easy way to get bonus funding and extensions.\\xa0 But if someone can contribute to the greater scientific knowledge in a demonstrable way, we can use that.\\xa0 Right here, we have my study on ratios.\\xa0 Common lines of thinking are that all sustainable lifeforms naturally fit into certain configurations on the macro or micro scales.\\xa0 So long as the scale is maintained, or not deviated from too much, the lifeform should survive, even as other life is grafted into it on the micro and macro levels.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t look very sustainable,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeeing when, where, and why it fails is my goal.\\xa0 It\\u2019s very possible that thousands of doctors and professors around the world are operating under a flawed assumption,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cIn the process, I\\u2019ve cataloged whole <em>texts </em>with numbers on the ratios pre- and post- graft.\\xa0 I have support from four different professors in Radham, and two more in other institutions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFile has details on your past,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting a sense of where things stand at present-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFour papers and one text published in the last three months,\\u201d Patches said, with pride.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s in the future?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>The creature made a noise, louder than before, a guttural whine.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNext step in determining sustainability.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll have my creature impregnate itself,\\u201d Patches said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a chimera, actually two sets of compatible DNA in one creature.\\xa0 It won\\u2019t bear a clone, but a genetically distinct member of its own species, I\\u2019m hoping.\\xa0 If it can carry offspring to term, that\\u2019s the last major benchmark in sustainability.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded, but I noticed his hands as the giveaway, clutching pen and book.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny other questions?\\u201d I asked Mary and Jamie.</p>\\n<p>They shook their heads.</p>\\n<p>We stepped out of the room, and the door was shut firmly behind us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNope,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDidn\\u2019t get any impressions he was hiding anything,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe even knew we were investigating on a more official level, didn\\u2019t flinch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was thinking it was more to do with his personality.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a long-term project, ties him in pretty deeply to the academic community.\\xa0 He had some idea who <em>we </em>were, even.\\xa0 That\\u2019s not someone who gets caught or used by the Shepherd.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you think, Jamie?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re right,\\u201d he said, absently.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, I\\u2019ll rephrase.\\xa0 What are you thinking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe animal in there.\\xa0 What he was talking about.\\xa0 Doesn\\u2019t sit well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOur sensitive soul,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She stepped over and gave Jamie a kiss on the side of the head.\\xa0 He smiled at her, still clutching his book tight to his body.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWuss,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He hit me with the book.</p>\\n<p>I amended my statement.\\xa0 \\u201cNah, I\\u2019ll back what Mary said.\\xa0 I think I get it.\\xa0 You\\u2019re a good person like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>We reached the staircase, and started our way back up to Gordon, Helen, and Lillian.</p>\\n<p>We were only partway up when we saw the woman coming down.</p>\\n<p>Half-again as tall as a woman should be, she wore clothes that were a part of her, waves of raw-edged, scar-tissue flesh flowing back to cover her hair, wrap around her arms, encircle her legs like a dress, and cover her feet.\\xa0 Only her face was normal, and it was a very pretty face, though the eyelids were fixed open with staples, and her mouth sealed shut by the same.\\xa0 Tubes ran out of her cheeks, down from her tear ducts, and out of her ears, while more extended from belly button, each tube feeding out a constant supply of black or bile-yellow fluid.\\xa0 The tubes themselves disappeared into the folds of the cloth covering.</p>\\n<p>Her arms were bloody, up to the elbows.\\xa0 That same blood was splattered all over her front and legs, with droplets on her face.</p>\\n<p>She made her way down the stairs at a brisk pace, crimson hands clasped in front of her.\\xa0 We hurried to get out of her way.</p>\\n<p>We were silent as we watched her continue her herky-jerky descent deeper into the Bowels, perfectly upright throughout, though her head bobbed with each step down she took on the stairwell.</p>\\n<p>We exchanged glances.</p>\\n<p>We bolted.\\xa0 Up the stairs, down the hall.</p>\\n<p>Jamie knew the room number, though I\\u2019d forgotten.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t matter in the end.\\xa0 The door was open.</p>\\n<p>Broken glass was everywhere.\\xa0 Helen was sitting against the wall, Gordon and Lillian were kneeling over a mangled body, Lillian doing what she could to help the man, though it didn\\u2019t look like it was enough.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMole?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>Gordon shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cBut he was hiding <em>something</em> here.\\xa0 Moment we started asking questions, he panicked.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHis panic agitated the experiment,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe experiment agitated his insides with her hands.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease,\\u201d Lillian was whispering.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease, please, please\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think you can save him,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s\\u2026 I wish I could, but that\\u2019s not what I\\u2019m worried about,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She looked at me and whispered, \\u201c<em>Lockdown</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A silence followed her word.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s go,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cGet out of here before-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The siren went off.\\xa0 All through the complex, throughout the Bowels, the lighting shifted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I slapped my face with my hand.\\xa0 \\u201cOh.\\xa0 Well, you just had to go and jinx it, didn\\u2019t you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Heavy thuds marked the barricades dropping down.\\xa0 With the experiment loose as far down as she was, chances were good that they\\u2019d only sealed off the exit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d Lillian said, in a small voice.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Like we haven\\u2019t spent enough time down here already</em>, I thought, as I heard the loudest thud yet, a final, terrible impact, burying us inside.</p>\\n<p><a

heard, one after the other, throughout the complex, each one a distinct \\u2018boom\\u2019 with a long series of echoes following it.\\xa0 The room vibrated with the motion of water through the floor and ceiling, before something filled up or the flow became consistent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust to make it absolutely clear,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t here when this happened.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 The look she gave me was a bewildered one.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFirst thing Hayle or Briggs are going to think is, \\u2018Sy did it.\\u2019 Guarantee you.\\xa0 I\\u2019d like to point out, for everyone in the room, except maybe the dead guy there, who isn\\u2019t listening, that I\\u2019m innocent this time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t argue with that,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou weren\\u2019t here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow is that a priority?\\u201d Lillian asked, her voice tremulous, like she might break at any second.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy does it matter?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt matters to me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong with you?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 She was gesturing far more than usual, and her hands were bloody.\\xa0 She shoved them in my direction, \\u201cThis is one of the very worst things that could happen, and it happened in the worst way, and you\\u2019re assigning <em>blame</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Deflecting</em> blame.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian wheeled around and lunged for me.\\xa0 Gordon swept her up and caught her in a tight hug, holding her back, and holding her at the same time.\\xa0 It served as emotional support just as much as it was keeping her from trying to strangle me with her gore-smeared hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can beat you in a fight, Sy!\\u201d Lillian shouted, still struggling.\\xa0 \\u201cJust give me an excuse!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I spread my arms helplessly, unsure of what to say.</p>\\n<p>Outside the door, a long train of people in lab coats ran down the length of the hallway, shouted instructions flying between them.</p>\\n<p>Lillian had seen her share of crises.\\xa0 Yes, she was young, and being very good and spending a lot of time around us did influence her behavior to sometimes mask how young she really was, but I\\u2019d honestly expected a response similar to the other doctors, rather than this.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Jamie, one eyebrow raised.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s claustrophobic,\\u201d Jamie informed me.\\xa0 \\u201cRight now she\\u2019s-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not claustrophobic,\\u201d Lillian cut him off.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m phobic of <em>this</em>, whatever the phobia is for being trapped in a dungeon with dangerous experiments and sterilization procedures!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUnderstandable,\\u201d Jamie said, gently.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen I think of worst case scenarios and I think of those a lot because I work with <em>you guys</em>, when I think about the stuff most of it starts like this and I\\u2019m in the <em>Bowels of the Academy</em>,\\u201d Lillian said, and she put an awful lot of emotion into her voice at the end.</p>\\n<p>Mary approached, and Gordon handed off Lillian to her.\\xa0 Lillian buried her face into Mary\\u2019s shoulder.</p>\\n<p>The emotion in Lillian\\u2019s voice carried over as she continued speaking.\\xa0 \\u201cI like to be prepared just in case so I can be strong, but in the worst thoughts I\\u2019m here and there\\u2019s almost no point to being strong because I\\u2019m here, and if I feel like imagining something especially bad to test myself, then sometimes something\\u2019s loose and we have no idea what it is, and if I feel like being really, really mean to myself, then I imagine Sy being there and he\\u2019s making fun of me all the while.\\xa0 And it\\u2019s <em>happening</em>!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy do that to yourself?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause it sucks being the only one that\\u2019s freaking out!\\xa0 Just like this, right now!\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want to stand out when you all are saying, \\u2018that\\u2019s one big spider, do you think it eats horses?\\u2019\\xa0 But no, I get freaked out and Sy acts like a penis, and Helen acts like she\\u2019s seen worse because she has and that doesn\\u2019t make me feel better at all!\\xa0 The rest of you are okay and nice about it.\\xa0 I want to mentally fortify myself, so I don\\u2019t get scared anymore.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can work on it together,\\u201d Mary offered.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ll get through this, and we\\u2019ll work on it together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be scared anymore,\\u201d Lillian mumbled.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve heard too many stories from my classmates and stuff.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDumbass,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie punched me, giving me a glare.\\xa0 Everyone else stared at me in shock.</p>\\n<p>I pressed on anyway.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re valuable to us because you\\u2019re normal.\\xa0 Mary should know as well as any of us, how we need people to remind us how normal people act.\\xa0 The day you stop being scared and become one of us, we won\\u2019t need you like we do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The counterpoint is that by being around us, she\\u2019s absorbing our qualities, trying to emulate us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat almost sounds comforting,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt isn\\u2019t,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cSy doesn\\u2019t do comforting.\\xa0 He does manipulation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, Sy does comfort people,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe just does it in his own special way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian scowled.</p>\\n<p><em>Everyone has a weak point,</em> I thought.\\xa0 <em>Everyone has good days and bad ones.\\xa0 It\\u2019s only when we\\u2019ve seen someone on their best and worst days that we can truly know them.</em></p>\\n<p>This was Lillian\\u2019s bad day, it seemed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou want to be a professor someday, right?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 <em>Her good day.\\xa0 The day she gets her coat and degree.</em></p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to be the best Lillian you can be, it\\u2019s not going to be by trying to fit in with us.\\xa0 Take another step closer to being the woman that wears a black coat.\\xa0 That doesn\\u2019t mean being fearless, it means doing what needs to be done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded again.\\xa0 She seemed a little less distraught than before.\\xa0 Mary gave her a reassuring squeeze of the shoulders.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026So tell us what\\u2019s going on,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>Her face fell.</p>\\n<p>I expected Jamie to hit me for that one, but he didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Perhaps he wanted to know as much as I did.</p>\\n<p>Lillian started explaining in a way that made me think of a stitched, very deliberately, without a whole lot of emotion, \\u201cI said this happened in the worst way.\\xa0 These first few floors are supposed to be for stuff that isn\\u2019t so dangerous.\\xa0 The lockdown protocols here have to be manually activated by the people in the labs.\\xa0 Something that dangerous shouldn\\u2019t be here, and it shouldn\\u2019t have gotten loose.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFurther down you go, the more there is to keep things contained,\\u201d Helen added.\\xa0 \\u201cWith some exceptions.\\xa0 It gets wobbly with people trading for lab space.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was this experiment, exactly?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProject codename Sub Rosa.\\xa0 Another attempt at reviving the dead,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He had the file.\\xa0 Jamie reached for the papers, and Gordon handed them over before continuing, \\u201cThey pitched it for weapon funding, saying that it had uses in feigning death.\\xa0 Spy dies in an obvious and undeniable manner, pulse stopped, heartbeat stopped, gets placed in the cocoon, revived.\\xa0 Or the Academy removes one of its enemies, steals them away from the morgue, and then revives them for questioning.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes it work?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>Lillian shook her head.\\xa0 \\u201cDestroyed brain structures are still gone.\\xa0 We were asking the doctor about this inhibitor that was reported to vastly speed up brain and muscle cell regeneration, but even if it rebuilds, it won\\u2019t rebuild the exact same things that were there before.\\xa0 Some, but not all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBlank slate,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHeal the body, restore the brain\\u2019s capacity, but the person doesn\\u2019t just magically grow back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave him a curious look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 Though she was oblivious to my exchange of glances with Jamie, she was more focused on the task at hand than she had been.\\xa0 I wondered if it was my advice or the fact that she was talking about something she was passionate about.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe doesn\\u2019t have any offensive weapons?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>Gordon shook his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s strong,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere wasn\\u2019t anything about that in the file.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian said, \\u201cDoctor Shipman-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHim?\\u201d I asked, pointing at the body.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHim, yes.\\xa0 He had to know that Sub Rosa was exceeding expectations,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cBut he chose to keep it secret.\\xa0 Why?\\xa0 Telling the Academy would have meant extra funding.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcellent, Lillian,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s a question we need to answer.\\xa0 Secrets within secrets, with that experiment at the center of it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded, \\u201cWe should probably check in with Gorger, then figure out how we can help.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We nodded, though Lillian seemed reluctant.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe experiment is probably killing everyone she comes across,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we\\u2019re going to contribute, it can\\u2019t be in a face to face confrontation.\\xa0 We gather information, disseminate that information, and see if we can\\u2019t work with Gorger to keep the problem contained.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A bunch of us started to speak all at once.\\xa0 It was Lillian who came through the clearest.\\xa0 Or Lillian that Gordon chose to listen to, anyway.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWithout us in the containment?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExactly,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Mary, Jamie and I spoke up at exactly the same time.\\xa0 He deferred to us.</p>\\n<p>I let Mary win.\\xa0 The nebulous benefit garnered by being the one to bring it up wasn\\u2019t worth getting on the wrong side of Mary\\u2019s competitive spirit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe isn\\u2019t killing everything she comes across,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe walked right by us as we were coming up.\\xa0 We weren\\u2019t even really hiding, we were on the stairs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYep,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I was gonna say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe went down?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDown.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s reassuring that she didn\\u2019t go after you, but why go down?\\xa0 Why is she being selective about who she kills?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cSomething happened to make someone call for an emergency state.\\xa0 They must have found a body.\\xa0 She would have moved on, or they\\u2019d have locked down one specific area.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cCode blue.\\xa0 Or a code indigo is possible.\\xa0 Or a code white.\\xa0 Code brown, even?\\xa0 That doesn\\u2019t narrow things down.\\xa0 There are any number of reasons they could have locked everything down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know what those codes mean,\\u201d Lillian said, quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is moving closer to me getting all panicky again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll I meant was that something happened, and it wasn\\u2019t just a strange creature wandering around that made people react,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>We headed out the door.\\xa0 After a moment\\u2019s pause, glancing at each other to make sure we were all together, we started down the stairs.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary took the lead, Helen and Lillian second, with Jamie and I at the rear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to find Gorger, first of all,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe hangs out more at the lower levels.\\xa0 Eight or nine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop at floor six first,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He handed the file back to Gordon.\\xa0 \\u201cOur scientist here has relatives.\\xa0 You guys interviewed one a month ago.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe did?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBug swarms, tranquilizing and anaesthetic venom.\\xa0 Helen, Lillian, and Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI remember,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe girl, right?\\xa0 I liked her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSounds like a plan.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>With the way the stairwell was constructed, the Bowels constituted a deep, circular shaft that disappeared far, far below.\\xa0 The stairwell spiraled down the exterior, with doors at set intervals.\\xa0 Floor two, labs one through twenty four.\\xa0 The entrance to labs twenty five through fifty was a bit lower.</p>\\n<p>After floor two ended, there was a gap where there were no openings at all.\\xa0 A given floor or ceiling was very, very thick, loaded with sterilization and containment measures.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t forget to watch walls and ceilings,\\u201d Mary said, pointing at the space under the stairs to her left.\\xa0 \\u201cIs that old hat for all of you?\\xa0 I\\u2019ve only done the one job with you, and a lot of interviews, but those aren\\u2019t really a job, I don\\u2019t want to keep giving advice that you\\u2019ve all heard before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDefinitely not a job.\\xa0 Torture, more like,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Mary turned and flashed me a smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWalls and ceilings,\\u201d Mary said, again.\\xa0 \\u201cTip Percy gave us when we were planning how we would deal with various weapons the Academy might send after us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a good tip,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t think she can climb on walls or drop down on top of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like being extra careful,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cBeing extra careful sounds fantastic.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She said fantastic with a dismal tone.\\xa0 If she hadn\\u2019t actually said it, I would have heard the inflection she gave her words and thought that \\u2018fantastic\\u2019 was a word that was never going to leave her mouth.</p>\\n<p>We passed floor three, the hallway that led to labs one through ten.</p>\\n<p>Long, long way down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTetradeleocleithrophobia,\\u201d Jamie whispered to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe said it wasn\\u2019t claustrophobia.\\xa0 It was a phobia of being trapped in a place with monsters and life-exterminating deathtraps.\\xa0 I really wanted to take a stab at it, but then she would\\u2019ve been trying to strangle me, not you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTake a stab at it?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou memorized a dictionary when you were eight.\\xa0 I\\u2019d think you\\u2019d know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey don\\u2019t let me learn Latin, like how I\\u2019ve been forbidden to read Academy texts.\\xa0 I pick some up, just like I\\u2019ve glimpsed textbook pages now and again, but I\\u2019m not sure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAhh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t like not being sure.\\xa0 Not about day to day stuff.\\xa0 But about my head.\\xa0 Either I know something, or I don\\u2019t.\\xa0 But I think tetradeleocleithrophobia would be right, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave him my best shrug.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s going to bother me for a long time,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we make it out of here, I\\u2019ll find a way to double check it for you,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 They don\\u2019t expect me to retain much, memory-wise, but I can figure it out and keep track of that much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He threw an arm around my shoulders.</p>\\n<p>We passed the start of the fourth floor like that, Jamie with the book under one arm and me under the other.\\xa0 I could see Lillian getting more agitated as we got further down.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary were in their element.\\xa0 Helen didn\\u2019t tend to show much at all.</p>\\n<p>Footsteps pounded on the stairs, echoing up the stairwell.\\xa0 We stepped into a hallway to get out of the way and take what little cover we could.</p>\\n<p>A group of men and women in white lab coats fled up the stairs.\\xa0 One glanced at us, but was too out of breath to say anything.\\xa0 Fear and concern marked her expression, and her unwillingness to stop for even a few seconds helped fill in the rest of the story.</p>\\n<p>Or not.</p>\\n<p>The start of the fifth floor was a little distance below us.\\xa0 On the stairs around the hallway, there were pieces of bodies, smears of blood, and more dropped pieces along the way.</p>\\n<p>Bloody footsteps marked the passage of the escaped experiment into the hallway.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe went this way?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeems too easy,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cToo obvious.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSometimes things are easy and obvious,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf she is in here, we can close off the section.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRequiring a sacrificial pawn,\\u201d Jamie observed.</p>\\n<p>It was a heavy concept.\\xa0 Which of us were we willing to sacrifice?</p>\\n<p>Why did I feel like one or two of the others might nominate me?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr we could try to convince someone else to do it,\\u201d I offered an alternative.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>He led us into the hallway.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d spent some time down here already.\\xa0 I knew that the hallways on the lower levels were more complex.\\xa0 There were thicker doors, heavy ones that would be hard for even a stitched with a battering ram to smash down.\\xa0 Beyond would be more hallways, ones with safeguards, sterilization and elimination measures.\\xa0 Stitched guards, probably.\\xa0 At least one of the corpses that had been used to decorate the surroundings had been a stitched, going by the dry flesh and the wires that had been pulled free here and there, sticking out of the flesh like porcupine quills.</p>\\n<p>Things had changed since then.\\xa0 Lightbulbs had been smashed here and there, and there were sections of hallway where a surprise party could have been laying in wait, complete with cake and clowns.\\xa0 Or monsters.</p>\\n<p>Monsters were more likely to be lurking in the shadows.\\xa0 We could walk into the darkness and bump noses with her.\\xa0 Even Mary or Gordon wouldn\\u2019t be able to achieve much if that were to happen.\\xa0 Torn to shreds.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis screams \\u2018trap\\u2019,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He\\u2019d already stopped advancing.\\xa0 \\u201cI was thinking something along those lines.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSub Rosa was human once.\\xa0 Probably isn\\u2019t very human anymore,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBlank slate syndrome, unlearned skills, partially retained skills.\\xa0 She might be more similar to a fevered stitched.\\xa0 Odd patterns of behavior, with brief and narrow moments of brilliance.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not impossible that she could be capable of laying traps.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIncluding preparing ambushes,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are your instincts?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLeave,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cBetter to live to fight another day.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Another Percy-ism?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t disagree,\\u201d I chimed in.\\xa0 I was actually glad that Percy\\u2019s philosophies and mine lined up here.\\xa0 If they hadn\\u2019t, I would have been put into the awkward position of either going with a dumb plan or possibly disturbing Mary.</p>\\n<p>Not upsetting or angering or anything like that, but disturbing her.\\xa0 Moving her from a place of peace and balance to something she was less easy with.</p>\\n<p>We backed out of the corridor, heading toward the stairwell.</p>\\n<p>As we retreated, a silhouette formed out of the shadow.\\xa0 Our missing experiment, taller than even a tall man, adorned in folds of skin.\\xa0 She had more blood on her now than she had when we\\u2019d last crossed paths.</p>\\n<p><em>Sub Rosa.</em></p>\\n<p>A knife had appeared in Mary\\u2019s hand.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t throw it, but spun it around one finger, catching it, spun it, caught it.</p>\\n<p>From the look of it, and I\\u2019d seen most of Mary\\u2019s knives at this point, I took it to be a throwing knife.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said, under his breath.\\xa0 \\u201cIf she was passive toward you earlier\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.\\xa0 The knife stayed where it was, but the periodic spinning motion continued.\\xa0 A comfort thing?</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa advanced, then stopped.\\xa0 She turned her attention to a set of double doors, heavy, built to interlock and seal.</p>\\n<p>She gripped the handles, fluid churned in the tubes that riddled Sub Rosa\\u2019s body, and the experiment <em>hauled</em>, her entire body contorting to maximize leverage, simultaneously forcing her body toward the ground and hauling back on the doors.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Lillian said, under her breath.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is bad, this is bad.\\xa0 Run.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRun,\\u201d Helen echoed her.</p>\\n<p>That was a <em>special</em> word, coming from Helen.\\xa0 We ran.</p>\\n<p>We reached the stairwell, and I was moving fast enough that I had to catch the railing to come to a halt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe security measures,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis far down, if you damage the doors, cause too much disturbance knocking things around, then the slabs built into the ceiling fall down and the gas gets pumped in, and worse stuff.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow automatic is that little feature?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery?\\xa0 There are places we\\u2019re not even supposed to run because the tremors can disturb mechanisms.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>We looked.</p>\\n<p>With the lighting so bad in the hallway and Sub Rosa being as far away as she was, things were barely more than smudges, dark grey on black, easy to miss when joined by spots in my vision and the throbbing of my heartbeat against my eyes.</p>\\n<p>The noise gave context to the vague images I was seeing.\\xa0 An eerie scream of tearing metal, followed by a metal-on-stone collision.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf everything\\u2019s automatic, why isn\\u2019t she triggering the safeguards <em>here</em>?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cShe just tore a metal door off its hinges.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt <em>should</em> go off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut it isn\\u2019t,\\u201d Gordon stated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t <em>know.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Screams echoed from the other end of the hallway that Sub Rosa was in, overlapping with one another.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe should go down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll corner ourselves,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re already cornered.\\xa0 If we go <em>up</em>, we\\u2019ll be out of options and still won\\u2019t have a way out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe could ride it out,\\u201d I said, \\u201cfind a lab to lock ourselves in, but I don\\u2019t think that would go over so well with Hayle and Briggs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019d have a better chance of <em>living</em>,\\u201d Lillian pointed out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you want to do that, Lil, don\\u2019t let me stop you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I watched down the length of the hallway that Sub Rosa had gone down.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re a free person.\\xa0 Still, I can\\u2019t think of anything more miserable than being in a locked room and being unable to do anything but wait for the monsters to come find us.\\xa0 It would be <em>nice</em> to have you along.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can think of a lot of things more miserable,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been practicing imagining terrible things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe should go,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot until we figure out if the group is splitting up,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The screaming stopped.\\xa0 Another sound quickly picked up in its place: the sound of tearing metal.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cQuestion is, is the Lillian you want to be in six years the type to go upstairs and hide, or is she the type that solves problems?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a stupid question.\\xa0 I want to be <em>alive</em>, you idiot!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUp, down, split up.\\xa0 Pick one,\\u201d Gordon said, with more stress than usual in his voice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian isn\\u2019t deciding,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did, I have, you\\u2019re the one making this sound more complicated than it is!\\u201d Lillian told me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou want to go upstairs?\\xa0 Go, then.\\xa0 Maybe Mary or Gordon can go with you, keep you company and keep you safe,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going downstairs with the rest of you,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat was my choice!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou didn\\u2019t-\\u201d I started.\\xa0 Gordon clapped a hand over my mouth.</p>\\n<p>Things were emerging from the hallway.</p>\\n<p>Not Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>They were men and women, and none of them looked like they\\u2019d eaten well at all.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t shamble, they didn\\u2019t limp, but many were hunched over.\\xa0 Glass cases and canisters were fused to their backs and shoulders, ranging from the size of a fist to the size of a breadbox, each one filled with a urine-yellow fluid, and each one housing what looked to be a sinuous aquatic lifeform, black and periodically uncoiling in the murky fluid.\\xa0 Octopus, eel, or a combination of the two.</p>\\n<p>Each had long tracks of stitches on their arms, legs, and chests.\\xa0 Their wrists were bent perpetually at right angles, metal spears forced out from beneath the flesh of their forearms and through their palms.</p>\\n<p>Modified stitched?\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t look well looked after.</p>\\n<p>The men and women with the jars implanted into their backs picked up speed.\\xa0 They were too malnourished to be fast, but it was a good indication that they\\u2019d decided to come after us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDown!\\u201d Gordon hissed the word.</p>\\n<p>We turned and made our way down.\\xa0 With one hand on the wall to steady myself, I could take the stairs three at a time.\\xa0 The others weren\\u2019t far behind.</p>\\n<p>Mary flipped a throwing knife around in her hand, then whipped it at one of the tinted lightbulbs.\\xa0 The light died, leaving an entire section of stairs in near-pitch darkness, while leaving me to almost miss the stair I was planning on stepping on.\\xa0 We fled into the makeshift shelter that the darkness provided, then stepped into the first hallway for the sixth floor.</p>\\n<p>Mary didn\\u2019t come with us into the hallway.\\xa0 Seeing her only in silhouette, I could see how she was pulling the ribbon from her hair.\\xa0 She knelt by the railing on the stairs, and then slowly backed up, joining us in the hallway.</p>\\n<p>A tripwire.\\xa0 Crude, but effective, especially when the experiments looked as fragile as they did.</p>\\n<p>Lillian and Helen stopped at a heavy metal door, much like the one Sub Rosa had torn off the hinges.\\xa0 The keypad clicked audibly as each button was punched.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamn it,\\u201d Lillian said, under her breath.</p>\\n<p>Our pursuers emerged, grabbing the railing for support, or shielding their eyes from the light right above them as they scanned the stairs above and below them, looking for fleeing children.\\xa0 That same light made the cases on their backs and shoulders seem to glow, and the jaundiced color of their skin became especially apparent, a sallow yellow marked with dull grey tattoos.</p>\\n<p>Prison tattoos.\\xa0 Convicts.\\xa0 They weren\\u2019t stitched.\\xa0 They were <em>people</em>.\\xa0 The Academy needed its fodder for human experimentation, and prisoners of war, the worst criminals, and ex-slaves deemed unfit to be citizens of the crown were all candidates for such.</p>\\n<p>Meaning they were people with cause to be angry, desperate, and above all else, they were people who were an unpredictable sort of <em>dangerous.</em></p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa exited the hallway, and came to stand in the midst of the group, head and shoulders above the rest.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d let them out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe has a strategy?\\u201d I murmured the question out loud.\\xa0 \\u201cShe knows where she\\u2019s going, who she\\u2019s going after, <em>and</em> she knows how to bypass the quarantine measures?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s not forget about her friends,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe might have left you three alone, but it\\u2019s not likely <em>they</em> will.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToo many questions, no answers.\\xa0 We need to talk to Shipman\\u2019s relative, and find out anything we can,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I checked over my shoulder.</p>\\n<p>Lillian punched a finger at the keypad once again, then mashed her fist into it, forehead coming to rest on the door.</p>\\n<p>Her bad day kept getting worse.\\xa0 I\\u2019d seen Gordon\\u2019s bad day, I\\u2019d seen Jamie\\u2019s, Mary\\u2019s, and I\\u2019d seen Helen\\u2019s, in a way, though Helen\\u2019s concept of \\u2018bad\\u2019 was different from ours.</p>\\n<p>Would it be consolation to her if I told her that I might start thinking of her as one of us if she could just see this through?</p>\\n<p>Best not to test her when she was this close to breaking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeems we can\\u2019t get through,\\u201d Helen said, turning my way to offer a cute smile.\\xa0 \\u201cWhoever took shelter inside changed the code.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

metal spikes on the railing, a muttered curse from one of the convicts.</p>\\n<p>We were in the dark, halfway down a hallway with only a bit of light coming through a slot above and halfway down the door.\\xa0 An angled piece of metal at the ceiling caught the light from above the door and reflected it down onto the door\\u2019s surface, making the keypad visible.\\xa0 At the other end of the hallway was the cylindrical shaft, deep, with stairs spiraling down the exterior, but Mary had destroyed one of the lights and the others were far away and out of sight.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa and a gang of Academy-modified convicts were making their way down toward us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to run,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She was closer to the opening, crouching, holding one end of the tripwire in one hand, a knife in the other.</p>\\n<p>With luck, barring any surprises, she could remove two of our pursuers.\\xa0 If we ran, we could slip ahead of Sub Rosa\\u2019s group and try to make our way down the stairs to another level.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it was just you, me, Gordon, maybe Helen?\\xa0 Sure,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t think half of us would make it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou, Jamie, maybe Helen, I don\\u2019t think you three would be fast enough,\\u201d I clarified.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Lillian said, breathless.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStaying might mean we <em>all</em> die,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m okay with trying running, that in mind.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf Mary wants to, or if Gordon wants to, then okay.\\xa0 We can split up.\\xa0 But I\\u2019m staying with.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m staying,\\u201d Gordon said, voice firm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe too,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we lose too many members of the team the Lambs might be disbanded, anyway, and I don\\u2019t know what happens to me if that happens.\\xa0 I like you guys.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled a bit.\\xa0 Mary was coming up with excuses, the group being disbanded, but something told me she was more attached to our little \\u2018family\\u2019 than any of us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll or none, then,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll or none,\\u201d Gordon agreed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich means our only option is to get through,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept we can\\u2019t!\\u201d Lillian said, with a note of panic to her voice.\\xa0 She hit the keypad.\\xa0 \\u201cDamn it!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet me,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian and Helen got out of the way.\\xa0 Gordon set about dismantling the keypad with his pocket knife.</p>\\n<p>I could hear the footsteps approaching, not just the echo, but the actual knock of foot on stair.\\xa0 I looked back and forth from one end of the hallway to the other.\\xa0 As I looked in Mary\\u2019s direction, she met my eyes, her grip on the knife tightening.</p>\\n<p>I could see the ways this might play out, though things got a lot less predictable when the convicts got close.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure what they were, but I was willing to bet that Mary and Gordon together wouldn\\u2019t stand up to four or five of them and one experiment that could tear steel doors out of the frame.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d the word left my lip before the thought had fully coalesced.</p>\\n<p><em>We\\u2019d lose</em>.</p>\\n<p>I gave her a shake of my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\u201d she whispered.</p>\\n<p>The footsteps were drawing closer, to the point that I could make out the individual footfalls between the scrapes and bangs of Gordon\\u2019s attempts at working with the keypad.\\xa0 They were just around the corner.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I whispered.\\xa0 I reached out.</p>\\n<p>She abandoned the makeshift tripwire, stood, and crossed half of the length of the hallway to reach me, taking my hand.\\xa0 My hand was more sweaty than hers, which caught me by surprise.\\xa0 I held her hand tight, being careful not to hurt her fingers.</p>\\n<p>My heart thudded in my chest, making my entire body rock with each beat.\\xa0 I was jittery, and I wasn\\u2019t normally a jittery type.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs, my friends, my gang, my <em>family</em>.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t want to see them get hurt.</p>\\n<p><em>Come on.\\xa0 Down the stairs</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>The footsteps got closer, and shadows moved just beyond the exit of the hallway.</p>\\n<p><em>Down\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was foremost among them.\\xa0 She reached the broader stair that was just beyond the hallway\\u2019s exit, then turned, facing us.</p>\\n<p>The convicts surrounded her.\\xa0 I could only barely make out their eyes in the gloom, as they stared down the hallway at us.</p>\\n<p>I heard a snicker.</p>\\n<p>I gave Mary\\u2019s hand a fierce squeeze, then let go.</p>\\n<p>In a fight, I was useless.</p>\\n<p>Better to give the group as much warning as possible, if this went sour.</p>\\n<p>I stepped forward, putting out a hand to tell Mary to stop, to urge her to keep back.</p>\\n<p>Another step forward.\\xa0 It put me at the head of the group.\\xa0 The rest were behind me, a few steps away from the door.</p>\\n<p><em>Might be nice if you popped that door open, Gordon</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>Would rather run at this point than put my life on the line for you guys.</em></p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa advanced, in the lead of her group.\\xa0 A woman in robes and habit of flesh, eyes permanently open, mouth permanently sealed, stained with blood.</p>\\n<p>The convicts were jaundiced, malnourished, but what remained in their ravaged bodies was a hard, scary sort of ranginess, as different from normal people as snarling mutts chained up in a graveyard were from house dogs.</p>\\n<p>A big fellow broke the silence.\\xa0 He stood a head taller than everyone, only a foot or so shorter than Sub Rosa.\\xa0 He looked like he\\u2019d eaten better than the rest.\\xa0 The leader?\\xa0 His voice was soft, but it had a whine to it, not suited to how large he was, the kind of tone I expected to hear from one of the youngest kids at the orphanage, telling Mrs. Earles how his toy had been stolen, except it came from the throat of a man.\\xa0 \\u201cAcademy brat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I kept my mouth shut.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook what you did to me,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He raised his hand, showing me the spike that speared out of the palm, forcing his wrists into a permanent right angle bend.\\xa0 The flesh around the spike looked red and infected, and there was a great deal of black and yellow fluid there.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d thought it was a giant needle, connected to the jars of fluid on his back, but it wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 It was solid, without a hollow part to it.\\xa0 Almost as long as his arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook,\\u201d he said, more insistent, his tone more of a mewl.\\xa0 Then, fierce, he raised his voice, \\u201c<em>Look!</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I kept my mouth shut.\\xa0 Damn him.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t the one I wanted to be focusing on right this moment.</p>\\n<p>Oblivious to the man\\u2019s cries, Sub Rosa strode toward me.\\xa0 Now that she was closer, I could see the odd musculature on her body, highlighted by the thin shafts of light that made it through the door.\\xa0 Of her entire body, only the face seemed ordinary.\\xa0 The rest was put together in an odd way, with a strange aesthetic to it.</p>\\n<p>I swallowed hard.</p>\\n<p>But I didn\\u2019t move out of her way.</p>\\n<p>As strategies went, this wasn\\u2019t one that was well founded in fact and a deep understanding of our opposition.\\xa0 This was one that was very likely to get me killed or maimed.</p>\\n<p>But she was acting with deliberation, not quite as if following a script, but not rampaging either.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d left us alone before.</p>\\n<p>She had been following a set course of action.\\xa0 Now I was putting myself in the way of that course.\\xa0 Testing it.</p>\\n<p>Behind her, the soft-spoken, mewling convict spoke up, looking past her to stare at me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou did this to us.\\xa0 I\\u2019d give you the worst spanking of your life, little boy, but I can\\u2019t, because of what you all did to my body.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Our</em> bodies,\\u201d the one woman of the group said, with a hard sort of anger to her voice.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t have the same whiny tone, so it wasn\\u2019t a part of the changes that had been made to them.\\xa0 It was only the one guy.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t take my eyes off Sub Rosa, I couldn\\u2019t.\\xa0 The convict\\u2019s words were reminding me that I didn\\u2019t have a course of action planned for what came next.\\xa0 I was laying odds on Sub Rosa killing or striking me.\\xa0 If it came to that, at least the others would know they had to fight if they were going to have a chance to make it out.</p>\\n<p>Between me and the others, there were only about ten paces of hallway between Sub Rosa and the door.\\xa0 The six of us were confined to that space.</p>\\n<p>I still had my hand out a little ways behind me, the flat of it facing Mary,</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoor?\\u201d I asked him, still staring Sub Rosa down.\\xa0 Her eyes moved down to look at me for the first time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t.\\xa0 If you gave me two or three more minutes, maybe, but\\u2026 I\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t turn away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t spank,\\u201d the convict mused aloud.\\xa0 \\u201cNext best thing, if I stick this down your throat, you think I can get the spike coming out the other end?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I resisted the bait.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa was only a short distance away.\\xa0 She was my focus.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBreakfast was nice,\\u201d I commented, for the benefit of the others.</p>\\n<p><em>Eating together with everyone</em>.</p>\\n<p>Silly last thing to be saying, as I put myself in front of a brain-damaged, door-rending killer, but I didn\\u2019t have time to really come up with better.</p>\\n<p>I could hear the sucking of the tubes at Sub Rosa\\u2019s face, chest, and stomach.</p>\\n<p>She turned, walking around me.</p>\\n<p>Her hand reached out, touching the top of my head.\\xa0 She absently smoothed my hair down in passing.</p>\\n<p>If I was shocked, showing it would have been a terminal mistake.\\xa0 I stayed still, my expression steady as the convicts approached me.\\xa0 The others had to handle Sub Rosa on their own.</p>\\n<p>The soft-spoken giant with a heart of perverse violence approached me.\\xa0 He touched the metal rods together, and they sparked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll give you your breakfast,\\u201d he said, under his breath.\\xa0 Just for him and me.</p>\\n<p>Oh.\\xa0 Huh.</p>\\n<p>I was between him and Sub Rosa now.\\xa0 He picked up the pace, raising his hand, spike extended right for my face, thrusting.</p>\\n<p>I could have sidestepped, but I didn\\u2019t see that going anywhere good.\\xa0 I stepped back, instead, and bumped into Sub Rosa.\\xa0 The spike came right for me.\\xa0 His steps were bigger than mine.</p>\\n<p>He was aiming for my lower face.</p>\\n<p><em>In one end and out the other.</em></p>\\n<p>I opened my mouth, and the spike touched my front teeth, something <em>cracked</em>, I felt like a vein in my face had leaped out the front of my head and torn away everything in the way, followed by a wave of clenching pain gripping the other side of my face, until I thought my own muscles would destroy themselves.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d Mary cried out.</p>\\n<p>I sprawled to Sub Rosa\\u2019s left.\\xa0 My face clenched again, as if the one side of it was a fist.\\xa0 The spike wasn\\u2019t even still touching me.\\xa0 I gasped in a small breath, and realized I could make a sound if I needed to.</p>\\n<p>If she was kind enough to fix my hair, could I ask for help here?</p>\\n<p>Yes.</p>\\n<p>But instincts told me no.</p>\\n<p>The thoughts that played out in the next few seconds told me why my instincts had told me no.\\xa0 Of all the possible outcomes that followed, Sub Rosa standing up for me and fighting the convicts was the only good one, and I couldn\\u2019t explain why she would.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t explain why she <em>wouldn\\u2019t</em> either, but I wasn\\u2019t sure I wanted to make a shot in the dark when I wasn\\u2019t even sure what I was shooting at.</p>\\n<p>I moved my tongue, trying to figure out the extent of the damage, and felt a large chunk of tooth roll between my tongue and the roof of my mouth.</p>\\n<p>My gaze was fixed on the convict as I spat out the little bit of tooth.</p>\\n<p><em>Stare him down, show no fear.</em></p>\\n<p>He was an animal, he barely had opposable thumbs anymore.\\xa0 I had to communicate by the most basic means available.\\xa0 Body language, expression, eye contact.</p>\\n<p>If I acted as afraid as I was, I became a known element.\\xa0 Even if every single one of his victims had fought back, even if he was an innocent man, if he\\u2019d been in prison long enough to get the crude, washed-out tattoos that I saw on his arms, he had to have learned about pecking orders, hierarchies, <em>power</em>.</p>\\n<p>If I spoke, if I tried to convince him, if I used <em>logic</em>, then I became a student of the Academy, and it was a very unfortunate thing that I was wearing a white uniform.\\xa0 They had cause to be angry at students of the Academy.</p>\\n<p>The remaining action I might have taken would have been to appeal to emotion, to communicate in terms of desire and drive, hopes, mercy.\\xa0 It was a shot in the dark, I had no idea who he was or what he\\u2019d done, but from his words and situation I didn\\u2019t trust his ability to give mercy.\\xa0 Still, it was the first choice I would have made, if I\\u2019d had to do <em>something</em>, like if he were to move on to threaten Jamie, Mary, or one of the others.</p>\\n<p>Instead, lying on my back, staring up at him, I spread my hands a little, turning my palms upward, fingers spread.</p>\\n<p>The man approached until his feet were to either side of me.\\xa0 The spike moved over, until it pointed at the base of my throat.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to smile, laugh, taunt him, but that was as dangerous as any appeal to logic or emotion might have been.</p>\\n<p>My sanctuary here was in being <em>alien</em>, in making him as unsure as possible.\\xa0 I channeled <em>Helen</em>.\\xa0 The cold stare.\\xa0 Well, a cold stare with my one eye twitching involuntarily from the last grazing touch of the spike.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t seem to care.\\xa0 He brought the tip close enough to my throat for the energy within to make contact.</p>\\n<p>Man, that hurt.\\xa0 My back arched as I found myself involuntarily pulling back, trying to pull my head and throat down through the floor.\\xa0 A trace of whatever was within danced down the back of my head, making my thoughts explode into white noise.\\xa0 He moved it toward the center of my body, making my arms, then one of my legs kick.\\xa0 He left it like that, my leg going nuts, my body unable to move away without me heaving my chest up and into the waiting point.\\xa0 Any second now, I\\u2019d lurch up and forward and impale myself.</p>\\n<p>The woman of the group stepped forward.\\xa0 She couldn\\u2019t use her hand, but she reached out and nudged the convict\\u2019s arm with the back of her hand.</p>\\n<p>My leg kept kicking and cramping up, even as the spike moved away from my chest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d the convict asked her.</p>\\n<p>He followed her gaze.\\xa0 I did too, raising my chin to look above me.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa had stepped forward, into the midst of the others, a few paces away from the door, and her upper body was twisted, looking back at me, at the leader of the convicts, and the woman.</p>\\n<p>Her expression was largely fixed by the modifications to her face.\\xa0 Still, an intensity radiated from her.</p>\\n<p>The convict who\\u2019d had me at spike-point looked down at me, as if debating his options.\\xa0 His gaze moved over the other Lambs.\\xa0 He spat to one side, then stepped over and around me.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t like it had been with Mauer.\\xa0 These convicts weren\\u2019t with Sub Rosa because they knew her.\\xa0 She was as much a mystery to them as she was to us, and the discovery that she didn\\u2019t approve of this sort of behavior was as much a surprise to the convict leader as it was to me.</p>\\n<p>A nice surprise, for me, but all the same\\u2026</p>\\n<p>Nobody gave me any help in standing.\\xa0 Given the modifications that had been made to the convicts, that was a good thing.</p>\\n<p>My leg kicked once as I used the wall to help myself to my feet, nearly forcing me to the ground again.\\xa0 I recovered, straightened, and wiped at the corner of my mouth with the back of one hand.\\xa0 It came away with far too much blood on it.</p>\\n<p>I kept my expression still.</p>\\n<p>The others had backed away from Sub Rosa, and were standing on either side of the hallway.\\xa0 Lillian looked scared, Jamie\\u2019s expression betrayed concern for me but not to the point I was positive the convicts would notice, and the others were managing to stay stoic and calm.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa stepped closer to Gordon, who stepped away, giving her space.</p>\\n<p>She reached into the simple mechanisms of the keypad, past them, and gripped something else.</p>\\n<p>The ceiling shuddered.\\xa0 Something heavy fell above us, inside a hollow space.</p>\\n<p>With a glacial, careful set of movements, Sub Rosa pulled out a length of what looked to be mummified <em>intestine</em>.\\xa0 Past the worn, shredded lining, wires were clearly visible, clustered together.</p>\\n<p>She pulled a little from the top, and the ceiling shuddered again.\\xa0 Dust streamed down in plumes from the spaces between slabs of stone above us.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa pulled some from further below.\\xa0 Something fluid moved through the walls and ceiling.\\xa0 Lillian shrieked a little.</p>\\n<p>The fluid stopped as quickly as it had began, but I could hear the trickling as the remainder found a way out.</p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019s brain damaged, even</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>What if she forgot a step?</em></p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa\\u2019s fingernails tore away the lining around the wires.\\xa0 She seized one, gripped it, and tore it.</p>\\n<p>Even with her incredible strength, she had trouble keeping the individual pieces from pulling up and down, respectively.\\xa0 Still, she hauled it together, closer, and tied it into a crude knot.</p>\\n<p>Far too crude a knot for my liking, given everything that those mechanisms were apparently designed to do.</p>\\n<p>My eyes met those of the other members of the group.\\xa0 They were watching as much as I was.\\xa0 They were thinking the exact same thing I was.</p>\\n<p><em>She knows exactly what she\\u2019s doing</em>.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa gripped the door that Gordon, Helen, and Lillian\\xa0 had been trying to open, then contorted her whole body to <em>shove</em> it.\\xa0 It rattled violently in the frame.</p>\\n<p>She adjusted her grip, then heaved, pulling back.\\xa0 Every muscle in her body, including some beneath the robe of flesh she was cocooned in, seemed to stand out in relief as she put <em>everything</em> into hauling back on the door.</p>\\n<p>Something within the door snapped.</p>\\n<p><em>Push, pull, heave, ho.\\xa0 </em>There was a mechanical kind of motion to it, it was so steady, precise, and relentless.\\xa0 Each motion seemed to bend things only a little.\\xa0 Stress lined appeared around the edges of the frame.\\xa0 Those stress lines became folds.</p>\\n<p>The convict who\\u2019d been threatening me was giving me a sidelong glance.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t do him the favor of meeting his gaze.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t know who I was, he didn\\u2019t know why Sub Rosa was interested in my welfare, and I wasn\\u2019t interested in informing him either way.</p>\\n<p>The handle came away in one piece, mangled screws sticking out the other side.\\xa0 She tossed it back and to the side.\\xa0 Gordon stopped it from sliding along the floor with one foot.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa had a singular focus.\\xa0 She hooked her fingers into the holes before resuming the forward-and-back motion.\\xa0 I thought her fingers might break from the movement, with the positions she had them in, but she didn\\u2019t seem to mind or care.</p>\\n<p><em>She heals fast, if nothing else.</em>\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure if that meant she healed in seconds, minutes, hours or days, but either way, she didn\\u2019t seem to mind.</p>\\n<p>The door folded toward the middle, and she placed hands inside the gap, forcing it wider.</p>\\n<p>Once she got that far, the door didn\\u2019t stand for long.\\xa0 In a matter of seconds, she was standing with arms extended to either side, muscles flexing against flesh until they looked like cords of rough-spun <em>rope, </em>thick as my leg and spun out in darkest crimson.</p>\\n<p>Shouts echoed from further down the hall.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa advanced, each step sure, oddly graceful with her abundant natural strength.</p>\\n<p>The leader of the convicts sneered at me as he walked by.\\xa0 The woman stared me down, an angry expression, dismissive.</p>\\n<p>It might have been rebelliousness that made me do it, but I was <em>inspired</em>.</p>\\n<p>I turned, and I walked in formation with Sub Rosa and her group of convicts, beside the woman of the group.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe fuck are you doing?\\u201d the woman asked.</p>\\n<p>I gave her a sidelong glance, but I kept my expression as still and as cold as I could manage it.</p>\\n<p>She frowned, but she didn\\u2019t press me further.</p>\\n<p>Without a word on the subject, the others fell in step, joining the crowd that had gathered around Sub Rosa.\\xa0 Even Lillian followed suit, miraculously enough, though her hands clenched her bag and betrayed her fear.\\xa0 Gordon was the last to join the group, and walked close to Lillian, so his body blocked the others\\u2019 view of her.</p>\\n<p>Apparently, the alien nature of the rest of us was enough to keep the convicts from making something of it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat the fuck\\u2019s going on?\\u201d one of the other guys asked his buddy.\\xa0 Both had scraggly beards, but one was bald, and the other had long hair.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever the fuck it is, it\\u2019s better than where we were,\\u201d the leader of the convicts said.\\xa0 He gave me a dirty look.</p>\\n<p>We made our way down the hallway, and more shouts joined the first, people ducking into labs, shutting doors.\\xa0 Locks clicked.\\xa0 The hallway extended into branches, forming a loose cross shape.</p>\\n<p>Sub Rosa stopped before stepping into the middle.\\xa0 She found another piece of metal on the wall, and pried it free.\\xa0 The work she did this time was faster, simpler.\\xa0 Again, a tearing of one wire, tying it.</p>\\n<p>Her head inclined up, looking at the singular slab of stone that hung over the branch.\\xa0 She shifted her weight carefully onto the next section of floor, then lowered her gaze, turning to face us.</p>\\n<p>She pointed at the convict leader, then the baldy-beardy, down one length of the branch.</p>\\n<p>At the next two convicts, including long-hair-beardy, second branch.</p>\\n<p>At the woman.\\xa0 She pointed and started walking in the same moment.\\xa0 Toward the next set of reinforced doors, protecting the next section of hallway.</p>\\n<p>The first door to our left was swiftly kicked open by the convict leader.\\xa0 I heard the commotion, the taunting, and the scream that followed.</p>\\n<p>The others were already working to kick in doors, punching at wood or prying at metal with their spikes.</p>\\n<p>The woman was hanging back, halfway between us and Sub Rosa.\\xa0 Watching both, a concerned look on her face.</p>\\n<p>Maybe not a violence-happy killer like the leader was.\\xa0 The individual most interested in figuring out what was going on.</p>\\n<p>I glanced at the others.\\xa0 Speaking was dangerous, if it could give us away to the woman.\\xa0 All we needed to be utterly ruined would be a single word from her.</p>\\n<p>Mary was standing next to me.\\xa0 My hand touched her hip, traced down her leg, and reached the bottom of her Academy-uniform skirt.</p>\\n<p>I slid my hand under it, along her leg, and found the sheath with knives placed along it.</p>\\n<p>She gave me the <em>funniest</em> look as I plucked one knife from the sheath at her inner thigh.\\xa0 Mingled curiosity and suppressed outrage, all bound together into a quirk of the eyebrow and a smouldering look in the eye, so small an expression that the convict woman wouldn\\u2019t see it.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Jamie, who was as cool as Mary was heated.\\xa0 His eyes flicked over in Sub Rosa\\u2019s direction.</p>\\n<p>I had to read so much from so little.\\xa0 Jamie had a focus, he <em>remembered.</em>\\xa0 What was he remembering?\\xa0 What was he dwelling on, more than any of us?</p>\\n<p>We were on the sixth floor.\\xa0 The relative of the dead scientist, Sub Rosa\\u2019s creator, was somewhere on this floor.</p>\\n<p>And he was looking over in the direction of the deeper sixth floor labs.\\xa0 Which Sub Rosa was in the process of breaking into.</p>\\n<p>I gave him the slightest of nods, my chin moving by <em>hairs</em>.</p>\\n<p>He blinked confirmation.</p>\\n<p>The convict leader stepped out of the one lab, and his weapons were splattered in blood.\\xa0 Had things gone differently, it might have been mingled with my own.</p>\\n<p>With a spring in my step, blade palmed in my hand, I headed in his direction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNext one is mine,\\u201d I told him, my expression cold and flat, as I headed to the next door.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t respond right away.\\xa0 He finally offered a begrudging, confused, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll see.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The others were already moving in their individual directions.\\xa0 To other convicts and other people who were slated to die.</p>\\n<p>It was a merry dance, dangerous, but merry.\\xa0 Each of us moved in coordination.</p>\\n<p>And we still lacked answers.\\xa0 We were dancing in pitch darkness, and one misstep here could end us all.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/09/22/lamb-to-the-slaughter-6-6/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe man driving the carriage was Mr. Percy,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot exactly him, the hair was a little different, but I recognized him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAppearances can be easily changed,\\u201d Hayle mused.\\xa0 \\u201cIf anyone would recognize him, it would be you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, professor,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs were assembled in Hayle\\u2019s office.\\xa0 We were lined up in front of his desk, while the old man sat, arms folded in front of him.\\xa0 His hair was shorter than it usually was, more neat, and his lab coat was immaculate, without wrinkle or speck.</p>\\n<p>The Duke\\u2019s presence reached even this far, from Claret Hall.</p>\\n<p>Hayle glanced at me, then back to Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cMary.\\xa0 Not to put too fine a point on things, but Sylvester reported to me at the time of your recruitment that you have a command phrase.\\xa0 If he utters it, you might be a liability?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A dark look passed over Mary\\u2019s expression, not that she\\u2019d been bubbles and sunshine a moment before.\\xa0 \\u201cYes sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPerhaps it would be best to keep you away from this altogether,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re collectively overdue for your appointments, which have been sporadic at best while you\\u2019ve been away, and I know there are places where we could make use of you, once those are done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t Hayle\\u2019s friend, I didn\\u2019t even necessarily like him, but I respected the man.\\xa0 In this, right here, he was proving he had the right to that respect.\\xa0 I\\u2019d communicated the situation to him, I\\u2019d asked him to take Mary on as one of the Lambs, and he\\u2019d agreed, after a long evaluation period and some research.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d told him the truth.\\xa0 That Percy had escaped, leaving a note for Mary.\\xa0 Where she\\u2019d been led to think it was a command phrase to turn her into a reckless killing machine, with me doing some of the leading, it had been a genuine goodbye, meant to express to her how fond he was of her.\\xa0 The command phrase hadn\\u2019t existed.</p>\\n<p>Now the man was back in the picture.\\xa0 He now knew, presumably, that she was counted among the Lambs.\\xa0 If those feelings still held true then the man posed more problems than his penchant for cloning alone.</p>\\n<p>Hayle knew, and he was steering us away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are stirrings of a cult in the Capitol.\\xa0 If we-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Hayle raised his eyebrows.\\xa0 \\u201cBeg pardon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to see this through.\\xa0 Please.\\xa0 I have to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Again, he glanced at me.</p>\\n<p>I wished he wouldn\\u2019t do that.</p>\\n<p>I parted my lips to speak.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy, Mary?\\u201d Gordon asked, before the sound had left my mouth.</p>\\n<p><em>No, don\\u2019t give her a chance to justify her position!</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause he made me.\\xa0 He can <em>unmake </em>me, if we let him.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t let someone else handle this and know that if he gets away, I\\u2019ll have that hanging over my head forever.\\xa0 We know now that they\\u2019re slippery.\\xa0 These women are his new clones, with the same idea as before.\\xa0 Except\\u2026 less intimate.\\xa0 Unless there\\u2019s a trick we haven\\u2019t caught on to, the only way we\\u2019re going to catch them is if we <em>bait</em> them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBelieve it or not,\\u201d Hayle said, \\u201cthe Academy has invested a lot in this project over the years.\\xa0 Time, effort, energy, mine above all.\\xa0 I would rather not have it go to waste by sending Lambs in as bait against a threat we do not totally understand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe understand!\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s what we <em>do.\\xa0 </em>You\\u2019ve sent us in against worse, with <em>frequency</em>.\\xa0 We assess threats, then we devise solutions.\\xa0 How is this different?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Well.\\xa0 That was a problem.\\xa0 Mary was emotional about this.</p>\\n<p>I had a horrible sinking feeling in my gut.\\xa0 Things had shifted to the point where, no matter what path we took, there was either a general sort of awful or a risk of a worse sort of awful.\\xa0 Hurt feelings and confusion, or danger of white lies being exposed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDog and Catcher can track them down.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not disagreeing,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cBut Dog and Catcher just came back from the field.\\xa0 This is their time to rest.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll be fatigued, hurt, distracted, they\\u2019re not approaching this fresh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s <em>your</em> time to rest,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon shook his head, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been a while.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve rested.\\xa0 We\\u2019re raring to go.\\xa0 You can\\u2019t deny that this is important.\\xa0 This is big, if our instincts are right.\\xa0 I agree with Mary.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t share her reasons, but we <em>can</em> do this.\\xa0 We <em>should</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt <em>is</em> important.\\xa0 That\\u2019s why that I don\\u2019t want a possible liability in the field,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p>Mary tensed, flinching as if she\\u2019d been hit.\\xa0 Hayle noticed.</p>\\n<p>More gently, he said, \\u201cI respect the work you do, Mary.\\xa0 It took some convincing on Sylvester\\u2019s part for me to bring you on board.\\xa0 That you\\u2019ve worked out as well as you have has been to your credit and Sylvester\\u2019s.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve never been quite so glad to have my doubts banished as they were on this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d Mary said, relaxing a bit.</p>\\n<p>I reached out for her hand, to hold it.\\xa0 She pulled away as if I\\u2019d stung her.\\xa0 She clasped her hands in front of her instead.</p>\\n<p><em>Huh?</em></p>\\n<p>Hayle continued, oblivious, \\u201cThat said, there\\u2019s a danger, I want to keep you with us, and that means treating this situation with care.\\xa0 If we acknowledge that the Lambs are the best way to handle the task, we might need to compromise.\\xa0 I want you to sit this one out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Good.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she said, not an eye\\u2019s blink after he\\u2019d finished speaking.</p>\\n<p>Glancing at her, I could see her expression.\\xa0 Stricken.\\xa0 Scared?</p>\\n<p>This was Mary laid bare.\\xa0 Defenses stripped away.</p>\\n<p>I knew why, and my heart fell.</p>\\n<p><em>Mary is and always has been afraid of being alone.\\xa0 It\\u2019s the fulcrum point I used to leverage her into the Lambs, and right now, right here, she\\u2019s isolated.\\xa0 She\\u2019s been reminded of our mortality, that she might lose any of us.\\xa0 To take her now and make her sit this out, it could drive a wedge in, if she even listened.</em></p>\\n<p>She was disconnected, at risk of detaching from the group, breaking ranks or losing faith and friendship.\\xa0 With our recent interaction, I wasn\\u2019t sure I was in a position to bring her back in.\\xa0 She\\u2019d pulled her hand away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir,\\u201d I said, and I hated saying it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe should participate.\\xa0 She knows Percy better than anyone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The old man stared over his desk and across his office to give me an unwavering, cold look.\\xa0 I knew he was weighing odds and considering all the factors.</p>\\n<p>To trust Sy, or not to trust Sy?</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d been trying to keep her out of this because of the details I\\u2019d shared.\\xa0 Now I was telling him to do the opposite, and I wasn\\u2019t in a position to explain.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll let people know what you\\u2019re doing.\\xa0 We have birds going out to other Academies.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll ask for them to keep an eye out for anything that looks like this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie spoke up, \\u201cIf it\\u2019s Percy, then it\\u2019s very possible that the women will meet the same physical descriptions.\\xa0 It\\u2019s easier to make more of the same than to make individuals.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll keep that in mind,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m taking you all at your word when you say you can do this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t miss the momentary, pointed look that he gave me, as he said that last bit.\\xa0 The message was clear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep me up to date,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd check in with your supervising doctors.\\xa0 Remind them about your appointments.\\xa0 See if they can make the time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We turned to go, exiting Hayle\\u2019s office.</p>\\n<p>The upper portion of the Tower had no stairs.\\xa0 The hallways sloped, something I\\u2019d always considered to be a nuisance.\\xa0 Stairs could be taken two at a time, going down, while the gentle slope only made walking difficult.</p>\\n<p>Little white birds had settled on branches that framed the windows, moving and fluttering as we made our way down to the next available floor with a stairwell.</p>\\n<p>A young woman in a white lab coat hurried past us, head down, clutching books and papers to her chest.\\xa0 She looked at us, almost stopping, eyes wide, then seemed to change her mind, heading up the hall.</p>\\n<p><em>Fear</em>?</p>\\n<p>I craned my head, looking back, to see if there were any clues.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was that about?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 He was looking, too.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen her before,\\u201d Lillian said.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHer name is Anne,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe works downstairs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course you know that,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd in the bowels,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe turns up a lot here and there, because Hayle supervises her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I cast another glance upstairs.\\xa0 With anyone and everyone, I now had to think in terms of Percy\\u2019s work.\\xa0 Whether she was a danger.</p>\\n<p>But the others were vouching for her, and, everything else in consideration, it didn\\u2019t make sense that there would be clones this deep in the Academy.\\xa0 If things were that bad, we\\u2019d already lost.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe was scared,\\u201d I observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThought it was something like that,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cGoing up, only person she could be going to would be Hayle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe works on the tree structure,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAshton\\u2019s old project?\\u201d I asked, suddenly spooked.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded, silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t think that was a project which would have emergencies,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere was one with me, once,\\u201d Helen said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cMy first time out of the vat.\\xa0 I was only half as tall as I am now.\\xa0 I opened my eyes and wanted to give someone a hug.\\xa0 They shot me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCharming,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe tree structure is different.\\xa0 This would have to be something else,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Mary remained silent, one hand moving to her side, thumb hooking under the side of her skirt, no doubt to touch one of the knives there.\\xa0 Reminding herself it was there, being prepared and primed for danger.</p>\\n<p>Lillian reached out with one hand, touching Mary\\u2019s.\\xa0 Mary flinched, then let Lillian take her hand.</p>\\n<p>Walking behind her, I could see muscles in Mary\\u2019s shoulders relax.</p>\\n<p>Jamie elbowed me.</p>\\n<p>I glanced at him.</p>\\n<p>His expression blank, he didn\\u2019t say or do anything else.</p>\\n<p>I elbowed him back, and he smiled a little.</p>\\n<p>Then we rounded another corner, and I could see people clustered outside the door of a lab.</p>\\n<p>Again, the attitude was spooked.\\xa0 One of them was brushing at his coat with his hands.</p>\\n<p>In another section of Radham academy, a doctor being very scared about what they had on their coat would have been a reason to start running.\\xa0 Here, it was only very concerning.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d Gordon asked them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnne didn\\u2019t tell you?\\u201d the doctor nearest us asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell us <em>what</em>?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>The echoing tramp of footsteps made the doctors turn, backs straightening.\\xa0 I connected the dots in the last possible second, not fast enough to do anything about it.</p>\\n<p>He rounded the corner at the far end of the hall.\\xa0 As he reached the window, he extended a long arm and rapped the window, startling the birds just outside the window, scattering them to the air.\\xa0 A smile touched his lips.</p>\\n<p>He was taller than a man should be, and he was beautiful.\\xa0 His overall appearance made me think of the face cards of a deck of playing cards.\\xa0 All of the pieces put together could have and should have made him look inhuman, but they only barely toed the \\u2018human\\u2019 side of the line.\\xa0 Shoulders and upper chest broad, waist narrow, legs lean, features sharp, with long arms and legs.</p>\\n<p>His blond hair was parted sharply, the majority of it tumbling down one side of his face and down one shoulder, more extending straight back behind him.\\xa0 His clothes were as fine as clothes got, with a decorated jacket in black and gold, the tail of it extending behind him, nearly to the ground.</p>\\n<p>Despite the heavy clothing, he had alabaster skin, without the slightest shine of sweat.\\xa0 He could have been sixteen or thirty, none of the usual indicators were there, but he carried himself like a sixteen year old might, while logic and what I\\u2019d heard of the man told me he was much older.\\xa0 He loomed, slouching just slightly, as if under the weight of the golden spill of hair and the heavy jacket.</p>\\n<p>My assessment of him was interrupted somewhat, as I was falling to one knee as soon as he appeared.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm,\\u201d he made a sound, amused.\\xa0 The voice was deep.\\xa0 Altered, augmented.</p>\\n<p>I stared only at the ground, kneeling, head down.</p>\\n<p>Only years of training my poker face kept me from flinching as his fingers touched my head, running slowly and absently through my hair.\\xa0 It was still damp from my trip over to the Tower, a little tangled.\\xa0 I felt stabs of pain as very strong fingers tore past one or two snarls.</p>\\n<p>The hand disappeared.\\xa0 There was a long pause.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStand,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet me get a better look at you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>As one, we stood, straightening.</p>\\n<p>It was the eyes that got me.\\xa0 They were eyes that made me think of countless people we\\u2019d gone after and killed.\\xa0 People who\\u2019d been pushed too far, or who\\u2019d gone over the edge before we even found them.\\xa0 A little too much in the way of whites around the edges, they didn\\u2019t blink enough.\\xa0 Tension did it, adrenaline pumping hard and fast through the veins for too long, muscles too tight in the face.\\xa0 People under a deep, profound, long-term sort of stress and those with mental illnesses often had those eyes.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t strike me as someone who was under any stress.\\xa0 His movements were too languid.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lambs,\\u201d he said, voice quiet and tender, yet still deep enough to reverberate, nearly musical in tone, \\u201cI was looking for you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>We\\u2019ve been actively avoiding you</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>The Duke of Francis was accompanied by four doctors.\\xa0 All four stood behind him, waiting for instruction.\\xa0 We were frozen.\\xa0 There was no talking without being asked to speak.\\xa0 No moving without permission to go.\\xa0 From the time he\\u2019d been born to now, his world had revolved at his whim.\\xa0 Only his family members would be able to gainsay him or check his conduct.\\xa0 As far as I was aware, the next member of the Crown was on the other side of the Crown States.</p>\\n<p>Long, strong fingers touched the side of my face, stroking me as if I was a pet.</p>\\n<p>His index finger slid under my chin, then lifted it, turning my face up, not so I could look at him, but so he could look at me.</p>\\n<p>Wearing the wrong expression could be dangerous.\\xa0 If I looked like I was frowning or sullen, he might take offense.\\xa0 If I smiled, he might be <em>pleased</em> with me, which could be worse.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm!\\u201d he made that amused noise again.\\xa0 His hand dropped away from my face.\\xa0 \\u201cLook at <em>you</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t know what to do, so I kept my chin at the angle he\\u2019d raised it at.</p>\\n<p>He moved over to Helen.\\xa0 I watched out of the corner of my eye as he stroked her hair, took the collar of her dress in hand and adjusted it, before bending down to tug at her belt, straightening out wrinkles in the fabric.\\xa0 He touched her face, running a thumb over her lips.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeautiful,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>Helen smiled.</p>\\n<p>The Duke smiled back.\\xa0 \\u201cThose doctors that accompany me back there, they\\u2019re the best at what they do.\\xa0 They create <em>art.\\u201d</em></p>\\n<p>He gestured at himself, as if to demonstrate.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey made me immortal, or close enough to count.\\xa0 They made me beautiful, strong, and quick.\\xa0 They made me dangerous enough to dispatch anyone who might seek to take my life.\\xa0 Yet here you are, and you could pass for a cousin of mine, with the same treatment.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen bowed a little, a coy smile on her face.</p>\\n<p>My heart pounded in my chest.\\xa0 The Duke\\u2019s thumb pushed its way between Helen\\u2019s lips, then lifted one up, making her sneer.\\xa0 Looking at her teeth, as one might the proverbial gift horse.</p>\\n<p>I clenched my hand at my side.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou look like you want to say something,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cSpeak.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was crafted by Professor Ibott, lord,\\u201d Helen said, demure.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm!\\u201d the Duke made that noise again.\\xa0 It was probably a tic, or he didn\\u2019t realize he was doing it.\\xa0 Or maybe he didn\\u2019t care.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s made noises about wanting to dine with me.\\xa0 I had a glimpse of him and I soured on the idea.\\xa0 But seeing the work he does\\u2026 hm!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Of course Ibott wanted to secure a spot in the inner circle of the Crown\\u2019s elite doctors.\\xa0 It was the next best thing to being royalty.</p>\\n<p>To secure him for the Lambs project, Hayle had pricked Ibott\\u2019s pride.\\xa0 Helen might well have been made to prove that Ibott had what it took to earn a place in the inner circle, and now things were coming full circle.</p>\\n<p>Helen was undoubtedly a pawn that Ibott would sacrifice for the sake of his aspirations.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been homesick,\\u201d the Duke said, as quiet as he was capable of being, with a voice and lungs modified to give him the ability to effectively address crowds.\\xa0 \\u201cHaving you nearby might be like having family close at hand.\\xa0 You\\u2019d be little more than a toy, but wouldn\\u2019t that be fun?\\xa0 You could play at being a noble lady.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, lord,\\u201d Helen said, smiling.</p>\\n<p>There was no other answer to give.\\xa0 The Duke had his own gravity.\\xa0 Nothing went against it.\\xa0 He\\u2019d grown up in those circumstances, and he\\u2019d been shaped by them.</p>\\n<p>I heard footsteps behind me, but I couldn\\u2019t turn to look without turning my back to the Duke.\\xa0 Anna?</p>\\n<p>The Duke straightened.\\xa0 \\u201cProfessor Hayle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord,\\u201d Hayle answered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been admiring your Lambs.\\xa0 This one in particular.\\xa0 Do you imagine Professor Ibott would let me keep it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe likely would, lord,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p>My blood ran cold.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut I wouldn\\u2019t advise it, lord,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy not?\\u201d\\xa0 Vaguely reminiscent of the tone of a toddler who just had a treat snatched away from in front of them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s a praying mantis, lord.\\xa0 Professor Ibott could explain.\\xa0 She draws targets close and then kills them.\\xa0 Ibott\\u2019s work is exemplary, but it would be improper, and there\\u2019s the outside chance that it might pose a danger, in strange circumstances.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want her for <em>that</em>,\\u201d the Duke said, cavalier.\\xa0 His hand cupped Helen\\u2019s face as he stepped past her, his arm extended behind him, as if to keep hold of a prize he wasn\\u2019t about to release.\\xa0 He was moving closer to Hayle, as if challenging.\\xa0 His tone was jovial, \\u201cBut just in case, my doctors here will remove the danger and render her harmless.\\xa0 Knowing what I do about Professor Ibott, he\\u2019ll assist in the process, to curry favor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs you wish, lord,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p>I watched as Gordon nudged Mary, who was standing behind Helen.</p>\\n<p>Mary had a knife in hand.</p>\\n<p>Having a knife in hand this close to the Duke, of all people, could be a death sentence for her and all the rest of us put together.</p>\\n<p>Casually enough that it wouldn\\u2019t draw attention, Mary extended the knife forward, and pressed the point against the back of Helen\\u2019s dress.\\xa0 She pressed with enough force that it penetrated fabric and sank into flesh.\\xa0 A spot of blood welled around the cut.</p>\\n<p>Helen didn\\u2019t move or jump.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Lambs won\\u2019t suffer unduly for the loss of one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019ll be less effective, of course, but no, not unduly, lord,\\u201d Hayle said.</p>\\n<p>I knew it was what he <em>had</em> to say, but I went from thinking the best of him to loathing him in the time it took him to finish the sentence.</p>\\n<p>Mary twisted the knife.\\xa0 Helen didn\\u2019t budge a hair.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t figure out the point or intent behind the action, if Mary had intended a different result or not, but Mary quickly resumed a normal standing position as the Duke moved, turning.</p>\\n<p>He still cupped Helen\\u2019s face.\\xa0 He looked down at it.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d changed her face.\\xa0 Not so much it was definable, but tension here, relaxation there, a fractional shifting of features, a smaller scale version of what she\\u2019d done to emulate Melancholy.</p>\\n<p>The Duke\\u2019s expression was haunting, or perhaps <em>haunted.\\xa0 </em>Looking at him, I fully believed he saw through the ruse.\\xa0 That Helen had made herself just a little bit uglier or stranger.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t a stupid man.</p>\\n<p>He let her head drop down to its resting position, from where he\\u2019d moved it.</p>\\n<p>She relaxed her features.</p>\\n<p>He lifted her chin again.\\xa0 She added the strange tension, even less than before.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPerhaps not,\\u201d he finally said.\\xa0 There was a long, tense pause.\\xa0 \\u201cProfessor Hayle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy lord?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre the Lambs at my disposal?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlways, lord.\\xa0 They\\u2019re preoccupied with a task, but I can reassign them at a moment\\u2019s notice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat task are they preoccupied with?\\u201d the Duke was all business now, Helen seemingly forgotten.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA possible cell in the city, lord.\\xa0 Someone the Lambs are intimately familiar with.\\xa0 He\\u2019s creating augmented women to infiltrate our defenses.\\xa0 He may be active elsewhere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI haven\\u2019t heard of this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI just received the report from the Lambs in my office.\\xa0 You were the next to know, lord.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Duke looked down at Hayle, and I wondered how sharp he was.\\xa0 He\\u2019d lived a lifetime with people dancing around the truth, trying to convince him to do things without outright saying such.\\xa0 It would make anyone paranoid.\\xa0 Whether it made him an <em>effective</em> paranoid was up in the air.</p>\\n<p>He turned, stepping back, studying us, evaluating us.\\xa0 There was a coldness in those wide eyes, this time.\\xa0 If he\\u2019d liked us before, I didn\\u2019t feel like he did anymore.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep them on that task.\\xa0 Have them finish it sooner than later,\\u201d he instructed.\\xa0 That said, he swept his coat back and turned to leave.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t miss hearing what he told one of his doctors.\\xa0 The acoustics in the hallway were too good.\\xa0 \\u201cI want every file on the girl, and a meeting with Professor Ibott before the day\\u2019s end.\\xa0 Verify-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>And then he was around the corner, out of earshot.</p>\\n<p>A simple fact check could be a devastating weapon.\\xa0 If Ibott was uncooperative, if anything we said or did or implied was proven to be a lie, the Duke could end us.</p>\\n<p>A full minute passed before anyone felt safe to move.\\xa0 The moment the tension was broken, the doctors in the hallway with us disappeared into their office.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou stabbed my butt,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wanted to communicate that this was serious,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t sure how else to do it.\\xa0 Sometimes you go along with things without thinking them through.\\xa0 I was worried you would go along with him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like my butt, and now it\\u2019s got a hole in it!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnother hole,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re gross,\\u201d Lillian told me, before telling Helen, \\u201cThat\\u2019s fixable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope so!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn your way,\\u201d Hayle said.\\xa0 \\u201cStay out of <em>his</em> way.\\xa0 Check in with your doctors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We headed down, taking a more leisurely pace, to be sure we didn\\u2019t catch up with the Duke and his retinue.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like how he <em>knows</em> I have a perfect memory, but he insists on reminding us of things,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cAlso, can we not ever meet that man again?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUnavoidable, probably,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNice play, Helen,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you very much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t afford to get on his bad side,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe already are,\\u201d I pointed out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll the more reason to wrap this up, neat and tidy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not disagreeing,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>We made our way down several flights, taking the long route around the circumference of the building before we reached the top of the stairwell, leading down the rest of the way.</p>\\n<p>Once we hit the third floor, we began splitting up.\\xa0 Each of us to our individual labs and doctors or teams of doctors.</p>\\n<p>I found my way to the small room where I so often had my appointments.\\xa0 It doubled as a research area and a storage area for books and records.\\xa0 Really, all I needed were regular doses of the Wyvern formula.</p>\\n<p>Huey was there.\\xa0 A thug of a man, he was

said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAppointment?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Busy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay, good,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I walked away.</p>\\n<p>Postponed for weeks, with no sign of letting up.\\xa0 All hands were on deck with the war underway, and our teams were preoccupied with other tasks and responsibilities.</p>\\n<p>The others would take longer.\\xa0 Their doctors weren\\u2019t as <em>efficient</em> as Huey was.\\xa0 I went up a floor, instead, and made my way to Anna\\u2019s lab.</p>\\n<p>She was absent, still probably hiding in Hayle\\u2019s lab.</p>\\n<p>The lab was dark and surprisingly cool.\\xa0 It smelled earthy.</p>\\n<p>The tree structure was growing at one end of the lab.\\xa0 Roots stretched across part of the floor, wood stretched up the wall to the ceiling, and branches extended along the wall and ceiling.</p>\\n<p>I touched the bulge in the center.\\xa0 It was cold to the touch, but the image it evoked was a warm one, a pregnant woman\\u2019s belly, fluid within and within that fluid\\u2026</p>\\n<p>It would have been nice to feel a kick.</p>\\n<p>A few minutes passed.\\xa0 I told myself I needed to go down and meet the others.</p>\\n<p>I stayed where I was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI remember,\\u201d Jamie said, behind me, \\u201cBack in the day, I\\u2019d find you sleeping on the floor in here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you remember?\\xa0 I sometimes lose track of how far back other people\\u2019s memories normally reach.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t forget,\\u201d I said, still smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cThat tree was dead, back then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 It was sad, but it wasn\\u2019t\\u2026\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t finish the sentence.</p>\\n<p><em>Wasn\\u2019t a bad thing?</em></p>\\n<p>A minute passed.\\xa0 I managed to turn away to go.\\xa0 I reached out for Jamie\\u2019s hand before I realized I was doing it, and he took my hand in his, book tucked under his other arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSee you, little brother,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/09/19/lamb-to-the-slaughter-6-5/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The weather was hot enough that the air shimmered in the distance, heat rising, a light rain falling.\\xa0 The city was covered by a haze, giving it a dreamlike quality, yet my adrenaline was focusing my senses, making the immediate surroundings extra sharp.\\xa0 Reality was a dilapidated neighborhood, crowded together, surrounded by walls and a city crowned by tree branches.\\xa0 The heat shimmer and the movement of the rain made it seem to be growing by the second, yet it never went anywhere.</p>\\n<p>The carriage was at the checkpoint.\\xa0 It was stopped, being checked, and it was going to take us several minutes to reach it, even while we used every shortcut at our disposal.</p>\\n<p>That said nothing of Jamie slowing us down, and the fact that we had to watch our backs.</p>\\n<p>A whistle, distant.\\xa0 Gordon.</p>\\n<p>Warning?\\xa0 Drawing attention?</p>\\n<p>I leaped up to a rooftop, grabbing the gutter for a handhold, then climbing the rest of the way up.\\xa0 I was glad my feet were bare \\u2013 they offered more traction on the shingles of the roof than any shoes would.\\xa0 While I was turned around, reaching for Jamie\\u2019s hand, one foot already braced against the little chimney, I studied the surroundings.</p>\\n<p>Further back, down the road, the Eastern woman had been alone, her companion branching off, very possibly flanking us or hunting for other prey.\\xa0 If I followed the path she was taking to its logical conclusion, she wasn\\u2019t there.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t see her anywhere.</p>\\n<p>Two in the wind, now.</p>\\n<p>I caught Jamie\\u2019s hand, hauling him up as he half-climbed, half-ran up the side of the building.\\xa0 I made sure he was secure before standing and stepping away.</p>\\n<p>Mary was quick to follow, faster to climb than I was.\\xa0 Her new clothes were already stuck to her, and a loose strand zig-zagged across her face, between her brows and down a bit of her nose, to reach the other side of her face, plastered there by moisture.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re gone,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cCould be anywhere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She gave me a curt nod.</p>\\n<p>We ran, with me taking the lead.\\xa0 My feet slipped on some wooden shingles, but I caught myself, legs moving as if I were running at double the speed, the knife in my hand stabbing at a gap between shingles to give me the necessary hold and traction.\\xa0 I had to twist the knife to get it free.\\xa0 I ascended to the peak of the roof, ran along the spine of it, and leaped onto a branch that jutted out the side of one building and used it to cross the street, leaping onto a balcony.\\xa0 The bag with Jamie\\u2019s book banged against my tailbone as I landed, feet skidding on a puddle, making me land on my ass.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was already running, leaping.\\xa0 I scrambled to get my feet under me so I could catch him if he missed.</p>\\n<p>He missed.\\xa0 I ended up catching him by the shirt-front, gripping it so it pulled tight against his body.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he breathed, as he took hold of the railing and got a foothold.\\xa0 \\u201cMary said to copy what you did.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut it\\u2019s a way to do things, worth trying out.\\xa0 Sort of works.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept you don\\u2019t know why I\\u2019m doing things.\\xa0 If you step on a patch that\\u2019s wet or muddy because I just stepped in it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight.\\xa0 Drawbacks.\\xa0 But it sort of works.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Copying me to the point that he was actually almost effective?\\xa0 That he could actually do that\\u2026</p>\\n<p>I shook my head, parting from Jamie.</p>\\n<p>We started to make our way over the balconies, hurdling railings, me occasionally stepping on them, an up-down movement that made my legs burn: up to the railing with one leap of a stride, down to the middle of the balcony with my other foot, up to the far end of the balcony.\\xa0 It was only doable because the balconies were so close to one another that they might as well have been attached.</p>\\n<p>I kept my eyes on the carriage, still at the checkpoint, still being searched and questioned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary!\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d she called out.\\xa0 She was only a short distance behind Jamie, who was a longer distance behind me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow close do you need to be to throw a knife?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAt the carriage!?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a pause.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat house with the branches,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>It was that far.\\xa0 A few rooftops down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo be accurate?\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>Another brief pause.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGreen roof with red moss!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw it.\\xa0 Further along.\\xa0 Ten rooftops to cross.\\xa0 Halfway between here and there.\\xa0 No slips or delays allowed.</p>\\n<p>I would have crossed my fingers, willing the carriage to stay put, but I needed those fingers to ensure I had a grip as I hurdled gaps between buildings.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThrow?\\u201d Jamie managed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe won\\u2019t get there in time.\\xa0 A knife might!\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>We approached the house with the branches.\\xa0 It stood out because wood had been used to grow the exterior, with four treelike growths at the four corners of the building, but the branches had been left to grow long and tall, a mess and a tangle that limited the view beyond.\\xa0 I noted a surprise clothesline I hadn\\u2019t seen from a distance, no clothes on it.\\xa0 I searched for details, clues that might inform my imminent jump and landing, my race beneath that strange canopy, and the leap to the building beyond.</p>\\n<p>In the midst of that search, I saw motion.</p>\\n<p>Red hair.</p>\\n<p>I was in the exact wrong position, moving too fast and already too close to the edge to actually stop.\\xa0 It made for a dozen conflicting thoughts and priorities in the span of a second.\\xa0 Warn the others and where was my knife and can I fight her and is it really one of the ghosts and what do I say and what do I do!?</p>\\n<p>Warn the others.\\xa0 My hands went out to the sides, fingers spread, palms facing the others.\\xa0 I said the first words that came to mind.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh no!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I leaped.</p>\\n<p>I had the knife Mary had thrown at me in hand, already badly battered for my use of it in climbing.\\xa0 Reminding myself of it, making sure I had a grip, it took attention away from my landing.\\xa0 I stumbled.</p>\\n<p>The red-haired woman in a gray lab coat was blocking my way, standing at the edge of the roof.</p>\\n<p>Fast.\\xa0 To get <em>here</em> from <em>there</em>?\\xa0 They\\u2019d been behind us.</p>\\n<p>She had an empty, cold look in her eyes that essentially confirmed that she wasn\\u2019t human.\\xa0 An experiment, or a modified person.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t blink at the water that ran down her face, beneath the hood of her coat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho are you!?\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>In answer, she stepped back, over the edge.\\xa0 She dropped out of sight.</p>\\n<p>One of Mary\\u2019s throwing knives hit one of the branches that was still swinging from brushing against the red-haired woman.</p>\\n<p><em>Fast, fearless, and knows what she\\u2019s doing.</em></p>\\n<p>I picked up speed, pushing myself, my legs screaming for me to stop, reached the edge where she\\u2019d just been standing, and leaped to the next building, as if she\\u2019d never stood in my way.</p>\\n<p>Mid-leap, I looked down.</p>\\n<p>No balconies to drop down to, no apparent holds, no hiding spots.\\xa0 The flat side of a building, a two-floor drop to the road, and nothing to take cover behind for ten feet in any direction.</p>\\n<p>I landed, and the twist of my head as I\\u2019d looked down and over skewed my body to one side.\\xa0 I dropped onto a slanted roof, and spun out, dropping to all fours, almost belly-flopping in my attempt to get some traction on the wet shingles.</p>\\n<p>I found the right orientation and clawed my way forward.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t make any headway for a full two seconds as momentum and my downward slide won out over traction and hurried movements.\\xa0 Then I had traction, and I bolted.\\xa0 Jamie landed to my left, hitting the crest of the roof, feet and hands planted on either side.</p>\\n<p>He fell behind, which was probably a mix of intent on his part, letting me lead the way, and just him being a little slower as a rule.</p>\\n<p>I was impressed that he was keeping up this well, as it was.</p>\\n<p>Another rooftop, then another.</p>\\n<p>I saw the red-haired woman on the far side of the street.\\xa0 She\\u2019d been running, and she was slowing to a walk.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t pant for breath, she didn\\u2019t say or do anything.\\xa0 She only watched, her head turning to take us in as we made our way forward.</p>\\n<p>As we passed her, she picked up speed again.\\xa0 A light jog, then a sprint, then a faster movement, her coat flapping behind her.\\xa0 Pulling ahead, moving to cut us off.</p>\\n<p>She crossed the street, drawing nearer to us.\\xa0 The perspective of the building we were running over blocked our view of her.</p>\\n<p>I made the next leap, watching.\\xa0 With the space in between buildings, I should have had a glimpse of her as she ran alongside us.</p>\\n<p>She was already gone.</p>\\n<p>Camouflage?</p>\\n<p>No way was there anything that accurate or effective in modern science.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Jamie called out, huffing for breath.</p>\\n<p>I could see.</p>\\n<p>The women weren\\u2019t our focus.\\xa0 The carriage was.</p>\\n<p>It was starting to move, haltingly as it had to navigate past bystanders and a carriage in the immediate vicinity.\\xa0 Not far away at all, a hundred feet, but there was no way we\\u2019d get down from the roof to the street, across to the cart and past the checkpoint before it pulled away.</p>\\n<p>We were close to the house with the green shingles and what I\\u2019d taken for red moss, actually an algae now that I was close enough to see.\\xa0 It grew on the rooftop and gave an appearance very similar to raw, open wounds.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary!\\u201d I called out.\\xa0 \\u201cThrow!\\xa0 Doesn\\u2019t matter if you hit, just throw!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I heard the short, whip-like noise as she whipped the first of the knives out and over.</p>\\n<p>I leaped over to the house with the green shingles, glad that the algae offered more traction rather than less.\\xa0 I collapsed, no longer running.\\xa0 There was no point.</p>\\n<p><em>A hail Mary</em>, I thought, joking with myself.</p>\\n<p>Not the kind of joke that was worth getting in the habit of saying, considering the Academy\\u2019s relationship with religion.\\xa0 Young children among the hoity-toity got lectures for saying \\u2018oh Jesus\\u2019, much as adults lost friends or jobs for mentioning religion.\\xa0 At best, it was a lower class thing to say, only the peons dwelt on such things, as Mauer\\u2019s followers had.\\xa0 At worst, it could offend someone with ties to the Academy.</p>\\n<p>The weapon flew through the air.\\xa0 Mary was already throwing more from the rooftop behind us.\\xa0 She had the threads out, and was spinning the knives in whirling circles before casting them out sending them more up and skyward than over.</p>\\n<p>Her aim was better than I\\u2019d thought.\\xa0 I had weighed the odds, and considered a civilian with a knife in their shoulder or head to be worth it, but Mary was better than that.\\xa0 The first two knives didn\\u2019t veer far off course, and they didn\\u2019t hit anyone.\\xa0 Crates, boxes, and the side of one cart, striking violently enough to interrupt conversations and turn heads.</p>\\n<p>The third hit one of the larger monsters that were serving as guards, just a little past the front of the carriage.\\xa0 Solidly built, with a bulging, translucent forehead and reptilian cast to its horned skin, it was nonetheless humanoid.\\xa0 I could hear it roar, see it react with pain.\\xa0 It lurched forward, lashing out, and shouldered its way into the horses at the front of the carriage, and the ensuing movement and chaos made one side of the vehicle rise up.\\xa0 Forward movement arrested.</p>\\n<p>We were going to have to apologize to people.</p>\\n<p>Mary grunted softly as she hopped over to the rooftop I was on.\\xa0 She walked past me, picking her way past one arm I had outstretched to grip the cusp of the roof, a thread and knife spinning within a few inches of my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKill?\\u201d She asked.\\xa0 She had a cold, dead look in her eyes, as she stared into the distance, focused on her quarry.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to say yes.</p>\\n<p>But we didn\\u2019t know for sure if they were Academy or not, and murdering someone who was in good standing with witnesses watching could get us in trouble.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWound,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She made a face, then released the string.</p>\\n<p>The knife flew skyward.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou ask a lot,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m a jerk like that,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd I know you\\u2019re capable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie stopped panting long enough to whistle, \\u201cIs it too soon to say nice throwing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cUnless he moves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man driving the carriage twisted, shouting something to people behind him.</p>\\n<p>But his legs were where they were.\\xa0 The knife came down, seemingly right on top of him, and he screamed, doubling over.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHit?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThigh,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She sounded oddly detached from things.\\xa0 No joking, no follow up comments.\\xa0 Like a stitched might sound.</p>\\n<p>My mind was switching gears, thinking about the social dynamics, the challenge of dealing with a crowd of people with guns, now at high alert, convincing them to give us the man in the carriage.</p>\\n<p>It was complicated because a part of me was stuck interpreting Mary, trying to read her.\\xa0 She was stuck in my head, for the time being, persistently, stubbornly occupying a portion of the mental real-estate.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe should go, before he gets away,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The group of soldiers was busy trying to get a wounded, angry monster under control, simultaneously trying to locate the threat.</p>\\n<p>Some were pointing at us.\\xa0 They had weapons in hand.\\xa0 Rifles.</p>\\n<p>Reluctantly, my legs protesting, still a bit short of breath, I stood up.\\xa0 I was careful to move slower to avoid posing any threat.</p>\\n<p>I sheathed my knife in my belt, slid down the roof, searching below for any sign of the red-haired woman before I let myself fall.\\xa0 I dropped down to the street, raising my hands the moment I was able.\\xa0\\xa0 Mary was the next down, and I lowered my hands enough to help catch Jamie as he dropped down, before passing him his bag with the book.\\xa0 We walked as fast as we were able, hands raised.</p>\\n<p>The soldiers weren\\u2019t pointing the guns at us, at least.</p>\\n<p>The carriage was still there.\\xa0 Once we were in earshot, I\\u2019d have to give them a warning.\\xa0 Make something up?\\xa0 I could tell them a portion of the truth, show them my badge.\\xa0 If it didn\\u2019t convince them to arrest the man, it could make them keep the man, his carriage and <em>us</em> in custody until a higher-up could arrive.</p>\\n<p>With that arrival, we\\u2019d have answers.</p>\\n<p>But things couldn\\u2019t be that simple.</p>\\n<p>The red-haired woman stepped out of a space between buildings, eyes fixed on us.\\xa0 She stopped, back to the men with the rifles, her full attention on us.</p>\\n<p>Her eyes looked <em>feral</em>.\\xa0 She was curved and flawless in a way that made me think she was crafted rather than born.\\xa0 With her hood down, her hair was getting wet.\\xa0 She\\u2019d cast off her coat with the hood at some point, no longer wearing it.</p>\\n<p>Definitely not a proper human being, yet something about her seemed familiar.</p>\\n<p>Blocking our way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho are you?\\u201d I tried again.</p>\\n<p>No answer.\\xa0 She backed away a step, then another, eyes still fixed on us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWound?\\u201d Mary asked, from beside me.</p>\\n<p>I signaled with a gesture rather than speak.</p>\\n<p>Mary threw out an arm.\\xa0 A knife soared through the air, straight as an arrow, aimed at the heart.\\xa0 The knife\\u2019s target stepped to one side, pulling one shoulder back and away to let the knife fly past her.\\xa0 It hit the road a distance in front of the men with the rifles, skittering, spinning, before coming to a stop.</p>\\n<p>They recognized it, and one shouted, \\u201cHey!\\xa0 You!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary tried again, not caring about the rifles.</p>\\n<p>Another dodge, to the point that it looked <em>easy</em>.</p>\\n<p>Enhanced reflexes?</p>\\n<p>This ghost was untouchable, it seemed.</p>\\n<p>We were drawing closer, though.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure what that meant.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Twenty feet away, then sixteen, then twelve-\\xa0 the red-haired woman was retreating without running.\\xa0 She was a short distance from the men with rifles, enough that Mary was reluctant to throw.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBehind us,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I half-turned to look.</p>\\n<p><em>Not just fast, but strong</em>.</p>\\n<p>The Easterner was directly behind us, approaching at a brisk walk.\\xa0 She had a small child in her arms.\\xa0 A grubby child, no older than six, or perhaps a malnourished eight, a girl.\\xa0 The girl was unconscious or dead.\\xa0 Again, the woman wasn\\u2019t wearing her lab coat.\\xa0 Only a simple black dress.</p>\\n<p>And way, way, down the street, almost beyond my ability to make them out, I could see the others, giving chase, trying to catch up.</p>\\n<p>Turning my attention forward, I could see the man at the carriage, turning to stare at us, his expression flat.\\xa0 He had longer hair and a widow\\u2019s peak, his beard cut so there was no hair on his cheeks, round specs on his nose, and a doctor\\u2019s lab coat draped over him.</p>\\n<p>He was pulling ahead, moving.\\xa0 He\\u2019d been given permission to go.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHold!\\u201d I called out to the riflemen.\\xa0 \\u201cThat carriage!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The red-haired woman bolted, turning a hard right and sprinting for an alleyway.</p>\\n<p>I twisted to look, saw the Eastern woman doing the same.\\xa0 They\\u2019d moved in the same instant, and she moved just as fast with her burden in her arms.</p>\\n<p>We moved to give chase, Mary drawing her knife-</p>\\n<p>-and stopped altogether as one of the men at the waypoint fired their gun.\\xa0 Aiming it into the air.</p>\\n<p>We came to rest, watching as the ghosts disappeared from view, the carriage moving further down the street, beyond our reach.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe carriage-\\u201d I started, raising my voice.</p>\\n<p>Another rifle shot.</p>\\n<p>I scowled, falling silent.</p>\\n<p>The men with guns approached, and we waited patiently as they drew near, hands raised.</p>\\n<p><em>One day, we\\u2019re going to invent a better brain.\\xa0 Then we\\u2019re going to put that superior brain in everyone\\u2019s heads, and stupid things like this aren\\u2019t going to happen</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>I considered it for a moment, then amended the thought to add, <em>as much.</em></p>\\n<p>Bayonet blades and rifle-nozzles prodded us as they drew close.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t suppose you could send someone after that carriage?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShut up,\\u201d a soldier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr tell us who was in the carriage?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShut up!\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I sighed.</p>\\n<p>We were searched, and Mary relieved of the blades they could find.\\xa0 When they realized they had to reach under her clothes to get at her knives, they opted to bind her hands behind her back instead.\\xa0 They did the same for me, rough, and were working on Jamie when Gordon\\u2019s group caught up with us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay!\\u201d Gordon called out.\\xa0 He had his badge out and was holding it up.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d already found mine in the pocket of my shorts while patting me down.\\xa0 It was sort of irritating that they actually gave Gordon\\u2019s a proper look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHunting enemies of the Crown,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can reach out to Professor Hayle at the Tower if you need to confirm our identities.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou attacked us,\\u201d the soldier said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe had to stop the carriage at all costs,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>All costs.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd my aim is good enough that I wasn\\u2019t going to hit anyone important,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d the soldier said, in a way that suggested Mary\\u2019s statement hadn\\u2019t helped our case.</p>\\n<p>All of us were panting, except for Helen, and all of us were sweaty and dirty.\\xa0 My hands were bleeding in places from the scrabbling, violent climbing and running on rooftops.\\xa0 I had a skinned knee.\\xa0 Jamie and Mary weren\\u2019t much better off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe carriage,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWho did they tell you they were?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t question him,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIsn\\u2019t that your job?\\xa0 To question and search?\\u201d\\xa0 Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>A little too accusatory.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t go over well with the soldier.\\xa0 Tensions and frustrations were already high between our two groups.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShift change.\\xa0 We got updates and debrief on recent goings-on from the last shift, which pretty much is jack shit all and gossip.\\xa0 Last shift processed the carriage.\\xa0 It looked like he had papers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I panted, eyes roving aimlessly, searching for clues or cues that I could use to formulate a better question, squeeze an answer out of the soldier.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave you seen the cart before?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn passing,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I could have stabbed him for being so unhelpful.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe women,\\u201d Jamie said, voice soft.\\xa0 \\u201cThe red-haired one and the Japanese woman with the child?\\xa0 Have you seen them before?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cCould you be more specific?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t brook that tone,\\u201d he said, now hostile.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure I trust any of you, yet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease,\\u201d Helen said, stepping forward.\\xa0 \\u201cChildren might be dying.\\xa0 Friends of ours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen knew how to provoke reactions, to play the social game or change the tenor of the conversation.\\xa0 She put the soldier on his back foot with one deft verbal thrust and a little bit of emotion injected into her words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going on,\\u201d the man said, \\u201cAnd I don\\u2019t like not knowing what\\u2019s going on, considering it\\u2019s a part of my duties here.\\xa0 Perhaps you should have your turn at doing some explaining.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I felt the urge to stab him again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomeone may be posing as a member of the Academy, using experiments to find and kidnap children from the shims,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe man in that carriage is one.\\xa0 The two women you saw are two more.\\xa0 There\\u2019s also a blonde woman.\\xa0 They\\u2019re attractive enough to draw attention.\\xa0 Surely you\\u2019ve noticed them before?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFrom a distance,\\u201d the soldier said, relenting a little.\\xa0 \\u201cUsually during night shifts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon pressed, \\u201cAnd the carriage?\\xa0 When you say you see it in passing, does that mean it usually passes through just before your shift begins?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI suppose,\\u201d the soldier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes the time you start your shift change, or is it set?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt changes.\\xa0 You\\u2019re implying some conspiracy here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they have a pattern of passing through when you\\u2019re busy and preoccupied, that says they know a dangerous amount of how the Academy and our military is operating.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Now we had the soldier\\u2019s attention.</p>\\n<p>And now that we had it, my attention was on the people in the background.\\xa0 The captain\\u2019s subordinates.</p>\\n<p>They looked uncomfortable.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpeak up,\\u201d I cut in.</p>\\n<p>The captain gave me an offended look, shifting to a hostile state in a flash.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou,\\u201d I said, pointing at one man in the crowd.\\xa0 \\u201cSay what you\\u2019re thinking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcuse me?\\u201d the captain asked, on behalf of his soldier.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not thinking anything,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour eyes slid to one side as you said that,\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a sign of evasiveness.\\xa0 You\\u2019re lying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>An utter lie.\\xa0 His eyes hadn\\u2019t moved at all.\\xa0 But now he was thinking about his eyes and not his words.\\xa0 More pressure, on top of the attention of his captain and the rest of the squad.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour buddies here are looking at you, your captain is looking, you know something and you\\u2019re not saying it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not thinking anything,\\u201d he said, with even less sincerity than before.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour gaze moved again,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt didn\\u2019t!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJames,\\u201d the captain said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this about?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not- it\\u2019s\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo we need to go to the barracks and bring others into this?\\u201d the captain asked.\\xa0 Now he was on my side.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI- no.\\xa0 No sir.\\xa0 It\\u2019s just\\u2026 the women.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat about the women?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen them before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid they have kids with them?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure, but that\\u2019s not so strange, is it?\\xa0 Given that it\\u2019s the shims?\\xa0 Even when women work?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWork?\\xa0 You mean prostitutes?\\u201d Gordon cut in.</p>\\n<p>The man startled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat almost makes sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The captain gave him a curious look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re weapons.\\xa0 Evasive ones.\\xa0 They\\u2019re aware of their surroundings to the point that they can avoid trouble and isolate targets, they pass as either employees of the Academy or as prostitutes, to slip past our defenses, whichever works.\\xa0 Individuals you don\\u2019t question, ones that can distract, or ones that you\\u2019re afraid to pay too much attention to, depending on who your commanding officer is.\\xa0 Probably different identities for different checkpoints and situations.\\xa0 Chameleons.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The captain\\u2019s look hardened into one of grave concern.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think you should notify people further up the chain,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause this is as serious as it gets.\\xa0 If they\\u2019re capable of doing this, they\\u2019re capable of worse, and with a war going on, they might not just have three.\\xa0 Or they might have these in cities other than Radham.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay,\\u201d the captain ordered.\\xa0 Then, as an afterthought, he ordered his men, \\u201cWatch them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We watched as the man broke into a run, heading to the nearest phone or superior officer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m exhausted,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>There were a few nods.\\xa0 Lillian was among them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s rare for me to have a feeling and be unable to pin it down,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut does this methodology feel familiar to anyone else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes went straight to Mary.\\xa0 She had a dark look in her eyes.\\xa0 Before I could speak, she did.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d was all she said.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/lamb-to-the-slaughter-6-8/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>We were surrounded with the net closing around us, and I was swiftly realizing that the so-called \\u2018net\\u2019 was <em>made</em> for this.</p>\\n<p>The women were entirely capable of staying out of sight as they closed the distance to us, and they chose not to.\\xa0 They revealed themselves, crossing a street, hopping down from one place to another, moving along rooftops, or stepping out of cover.\\xa0 Most were wearing black dresses, some had shoes, some didn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>But each and every one was erratic.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t run headlong at us, but moved in diagonals or horizontally.\\xa0 They only revealed themselves when they were in a position to reverse direction and take cover, or take a step to the side and be out of reach.\\xa0 All of the instincts and habits and prediction that suggested where they <em>should</em> be were consistently, inevitably wrong.\\xa0 They would step out of sight and reappear a distance away, and I could never be sure if it was the same one, or a clone.</p>\\n<p>Three times, Mary started to move to throw a knife, and each of those times, the ghosts would fade away in the same moment she started to move.\\xa0 The knife never left her hand.\\xa0 It would have been a wasted throw.</p>\\n<p>As psychological weapons went, it was all very effective.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Dog had broken away from the group, and I could see some of the women moving, turned away from us, giving chase in their roundabout way.\\xa0 The women were still disappearing, hiding with the same mind-bending effectiveness, even though we weren\\u2019t their focus.</p>\\n<p>Throughout it all, I could feel a peculiar tension and strain, as if my body was experiencing a unique form of stress, bone-deep.\\xa0 It was as if something was stretched too tight, a terrible noise that would have been hurting my ears if I could hear it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEcholocation,\\u201d I said, between pants for breath.\\xa0 I was running as fast as I was capable.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>They communicated through screeches, too high for the human ear to catch.\\xa0 Those same screeches told them where we were, and what the surroundings were.\\xa0 To be this effective at staying out of sight, they were mapping it all out in their heads, figuring out where our fields of view were, and avoiding those areas.</p>\\n<p>If I recognized their system and tried to muck with it by turning my head more, being unpredictable, I only saw glimpses.\\xa0 My head and eyes could move faster than their whole bodies could, but only barely.</p>\\n<p>Not sustainable.\\xa0 I was disorienting myself more than anything.</p>\\n<p>Craig had said this was Academy work.\\xa0 We\\u2019d convinced ourselves otherwise.</p>\\n<p>But to create this many, to do work <em>this good</em>, it was beyond the capacity of the rebellion, as I understood it.\\xa0 The Snake Charmer, Percy, and all of the doctors working for the rebellion thus far had been people who\\u2019d been removed from the Academy.\\xa0 Less resources, less education, or less grounding.\\xa0 Some had been brilliant, but they\\u2019d been working with less.</p>\\n<p>Unless there was something I was missing, these women were on the level of a superweapon.\\xa0 On par with Dog and Catcher, or the Humors, or the Lambs, but modern, not years out of date.</p>\\n<p>That did mean they were less experienced.</p>\\n<p><em>No, I have to focus.</em>\\xa0 It was too hard to think along multiple tracks at once, these days.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere!\\u201d I pointed.</p>\\n<p>An ajar door.</p>\\n<p>If we were being surrounded, then we had to minimize the number of avenues they had for approach.</p>\\n<p>We ran through the door, catcher first, Mary at the rear.\\xa0 She slammed the door shut behind her.</p>\\n<p>It was an apartment complex under construction, two stories high, getting more apartments with length rather than height.\\xa0 The essential posts and beams of the building were intact, not yet cut back from the mostly straight, treelike growths that had been generated, and only a few walls were being grown, plant matter set to grow, the rapid growth directed with boards that had been propped up and temporarily clamped into place.\\xa0 The project must have moldered, because there was grass and flowers growing up here and there where the work had been left incomplete.</p>\\n<p>The door was barely shut when I heard glass breaking and things tumbling to the floor above us, and at the various parts of the building to the left, right, and front of us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe cornered ourselves!\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Catcher and I spoke at the same time.\\xa0 Catcher glanced at me, and I said, \\u201cWe were already cornered.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh god,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI remember-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She paused, she was talking too fast while trying to take too much air in, and ran into a conflict of sorts.\\xa0 \\u201c-when I started.\\xa0 They said I wouldn\\u2019t get into danger.\\xa0 I\\u2019d stay at the back and sidelines, just close enough to practice what I\\u2019d already learned.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey lie,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSays our best liar.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEverything I am, I learn from others.\\xa0 I learned from them, Lil.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFocus!\\u201d Catcher barked.\\xa0 All business.\\xa0 \\u201cYour hand signals, earlier.\\xa0 You have a minute to teach me.\\xa0 Command for stop?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have three,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cDifferent-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have fifty-five seconds to teach me!\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop,\\u201d Mary raised a fist, pointing it at the ceiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLeft?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLike this with left hand,\\u201d she said, doing the same gesture, pinky extended, then raised her other hand, thumb extended, \\u201cThis with right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can guess what the sign for the other direction is.\\xa0 Danger?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary extended middle and index finger together, pointed in various directions.\\xa0 She then pointed it straight down.\\xa0 \\u201cTrap.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He did the gesture, but pointed straight up.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s this, then?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHeads up.\\xa0 Alert,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou sat down and worked this out?\\xa0 A special language, for all of you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt evolved naturally.\\xa0 We bullshit it half the time and trust the others to figure out what we mean.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou think they hear us?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey hear everything,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they do have echolocation, they hear the walls.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked to make sure Jamie, Helen, and Lillian were keeping up.\\xa0 We\\u2019d spent enough time out and about in the last six months for them to build up stamina, but Jamie and Lillian weren\\u2019t athletic.\\xa0 Not like Mary, definitely not like Gordon.</p>\\n<p>Helen was different.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t have the <em>capacity</em> to build stamina in that sense.\\xa0 The rest of us, we were human, in varying senses, and humans had come into being as primates who excelled at marathon running.\\xa0 In getting better at running, we were returning to our roots.\\xa0 For her, it was learning something alien.\\xa0 Something she wasn\\u2019t built for.</p>\\n<p>Catcher raised a hand, two fingers raised.</p>\\n<p><em>Alert</em>.</p>\\n<p>He was adjusting his grip on his weapon.</p>\\n<p>Twenty feet down the hall, a red-haired woman stepped out of a doorway, spinning to face us, rapidly walking backward.</p>\\n<p>The two fingers folded into his fist, leaving only the gesture for \\u2018stop\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d picked it up fast enough.</p>\\n<p>We stopped in the middle of the hallway.\\xa0 There were no footsteps drumming above us, but there were creaks here and there in the apartment building, as if it were caught in a strong wind, or it was busy resettling.</p>\\n<p>A full second after we stopped, the sounds did too.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHello!\\u201d Helen called out to the red-haired woman.</p>\\n<p>The woman was silent, staring.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She pushed her way through the group, slowly approaching.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not armed, see?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Hands out to the side, fingers splayed.</p>\\n<p>I held out my hand, two fingers together, pointing at the ceiling.</p>\\n<p>Helen pushed my hand aside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can search me, can\\u2019t you?\\xa0 You know I don\\u2019t have any weapons,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI just want to say hi, before you all jump on us all at once and cut us into itty bitty pieces.\\xa0 You\\u2019re <em>pretty.\\xa0 </em>I\\u2019m glad I get to die looking at something pretty.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was rambling, not really stopping one sentence before leaping into the next.\\xa0 Patter, customized for her target.\\xa0 She was drawing nearer, halfway between us and the woman-</p>\\n<p>Helen set her foot down on floorboards, and her foot went through, the floorboards shifting.\\xa0 It was only a foot or so of distance from floorboard to the surface beneath, but it left Helen off balance, unable to pull back or pull away while she reeled, trying not to fall forward and wrench the ankle.</p>\\n<p>The red-haired woman was already moving, lunging forward from the instant the foot came down.\\xa0 She <em>also</em> put a foot through floorboards that had been nailed in place, but for her it was a deliberate motion.</p>\\n<p>She raised the same foot, kicking straight up to bring a shorter piece of board straight up into the air to slap against her waiting palm.</p>\\n<p>She thrust her blunt spear toward Helen\\u2019s throat.</p>\\n<p>It was a series of movements that made me think of Mary.</p>\\n<p>Helen let herself collapse backward, like a rag doll, one ankle still embedded.\\xa0 Her back flat against the ground, she brought her feet up.</p>\\n<p>The spear wielding red-haired woman was already pressing the attack, stepping forward again, this time onto secure ground, stabbing for Helen\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p>Catcher\\u2019s mancatcher encircled the end of the board.\\xa0 He wrestled it to one side, forcing the woman to drop it, then lunged forward, moving not in a straight line, but curving off to the right, to place his feet on the floorboards at the base of the wall.\\xa0 They rattled, but they didn\\u2019t collapse or slide off to one side to let his foot fall through.</p>\\n<p>He was fast.\\xa0 Almost the opposite of Helen in many respects, he was built to <em>survive</em>, to <em>endure</em>.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t tire from running, and he was built to be good at it, just as he was built to be strong.</p>\\n<p>She was quicker, all of our pursuers were, but the red-haired woman lost time by having to turn around and navigate the shaky floorboards.\\xa0 While she was picking her way, skipping more than running, covering surprising ground while doing so, he extended the mancatcher for the back of her throat.\\xa0 As if she had eyes in the back of her head, the woman ducked beneath it, and it snapped closed above the top of her head.</p>\\n<p>A moment later, floorboards gave way under Catcher\\u2019s foot, and he twisted as he fell, using the rotation of his body to get more velocity as he threw.\\xa0 A bola.\\xa0 Mary threw too, almost in unison.</p>\\n<p>The red-haired woman dodged that too, moving to the other side of the hallway.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s knife-throw had followed Catcher\\u2019s throw by no more than a second, and the red-haired woman stepped out of the way of that too.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t all a wash; the two sudden changes of direction left her off balance, and Catcher took advantage.\\xa0 His feet under him, he lunged forward, weapon in one hand, the other outstretched.\\xa0 Between the reach of his already long arms and his pole-weapon, he wasn\\u2019t leaving her any room to dodge to either side.</p>\\n<p>Helen raised a hand to her ear, then made a high sound, \\u201cEeh!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Whatever she was trying to communicate, Catcher reacted too.\\xa0 He moved, striking out, but he was blind to the exact nature of the attack.\\xa0 A petite brunette woman tore out of one doorway, straight behind Catcher, knocking his legs out from under him.</p>\\n<p>A moment later, the red-haired woman was gone through a doorway, the brunette had carried on forward into another apartment, and Catcher was lying on the floor of the hallway, staring up at the ceiling.\\xa0 No danger in sight.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHmm,\\u201d Catcher made a noise.</p>\\n<p>Noises rustled throughout the building for a moment as the ghosts found new positions.</p>\\n<p>Then we had silence.</p>\\n<p>We picked our way over the section of floor, approaching Catcher, as he helped himself to his feet, using his pole.</p>\\n<p>He touched the back of his legs, and the tips of his gloved fingers were crimson with blood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey hear the walls well enough to know what parts of the building are sound,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo it seems,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI really thought that might work,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She gestured.\\xa0 <em>That enemy.\\xa0 Silent.\\xa0 Quiet/rest</em>.</p>\\n<p>No hostile action, no sound, no indicator of violence.\\xa0 Just letting Helen walk into the de-facto trap.</p>\\n<p>Catcher was watching us, his eyes on Helen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm, here,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He pulled out a paper from his pocket, and wrote down the gist of it for Catcher.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm,\\u201d Catcher observed.\\xa0 He gestured, emulating Helen, and Jamie pointed to words in turn.\\xa0 The man went on to say, \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to remember all of this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She switched to gestures once she had Helen\\u2019s attention.\\xa0 <em>Noise.\\xa0 You.\\xa0 </em>The third sign was the one for <em>morning, past, before</em>.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was scribbling down a rough translation for Catcher.</p>\\n<p><em>Enemy scream.\\xa0 I warn.</em></p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d heard the scream, at a pitch and volume none of the rest of us, Catcher excluded, had been able to hear, and with no time to spare, had tried to communicate that the <em>enemy</em> was communicating.\\xa0 It was a very instinctual, Helen way of dealing with it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNext time, signal us?\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Helen nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny chance we can learn what they\\u2019re saying?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cPredict their moves?\\xa0 It would force them to either stop coordinating so damn well, or let us counterattack.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you could, I would be amazed,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a mess of noise, faint enough I\\u2019m not sure if I\\u2019m imagining the sounds or hearing them.\\xa0 It gets louder as they close in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen nodded.\\xa0 Same for her, apparently.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamn,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think they\\u2019re that capable of fighting,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cSeeing how they moved, they\\u2019ve practiced, but they aren\\u2019t <em>practiced, </em>if that makes any sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Catcher nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope Gordon\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI trust Gordon to handle himself,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut we need to keep up with him.\\xa0 Do you have the scent, or whatever?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 He took the pen from Jamie, scribbling down a message.\\xa0 \\u201cDog will let us know which direction to go in, as soon as we\\u2019re out and able to communicate.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The message read only: <em>Yes.</em></p>\\n<p>He paused, then added, <em>they\\u2019re communicating</em>.</p>\\n<p>He did have the scent.\\xa0 A small mistruth was changing how the ghosts organized.\\xa0 More weight on Gordon and Dog, but it perhaps alleviated pressure on us.</p>\\n<p>Catcher led the way, the butt end of his polearm sweeping across the floor, checking for loose floorboards.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t much slower, despite the damage to his legs.\\xa0 I was expecting trouble to come from around the corner or any of the doorways we passed, but there was nothing.</p>\\n<p>As we reached the double doors at the end of the hallway, he kicked it open, picking up speed.\\xa0 Mary was right beside him, passing through the door in the same moment.</p>\\n<p>He slammed his hand out, clumsy given the need for haste, and shoved Mary into the doorframe.\\xa0 He brought his foot out, kicking, and stopped mid-stride, hovering over the top of a set of stairs.</p>\\n<p>Razor wire.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook out!\\u201d Mary shrieked, throwing herself back toward the rest of us.\\xa0 I caught her in my arms.</p>\\n<p>With my face full of Mary hair and shoulder, I didn\\u2019t see all of what happened next.\\xa0 A piece of furniture, a stack of bricks and a ladder slammed down onto the top of the stairs, between us and Catcher.\\xa0 Brick fragments and bits of wood went flying in every direction, and the dust that came with all of it occluded our view further.</p>\\n<p>Jamie whistled, a short, sharp sound.</p>\\n<p>I turned to look, and saw figures moving across the hall, further down.</p>\\n<p>The net was closing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTraps,\\u201d Mary observed.\\xa0 She looked angry.\\xa0 \\u201cDeadfall, razor wire.\\xa0 Staples.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBacked by a natural ability to assess environment and locate the enemy,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Catcher was isolated.\\xa0 If he was hampered or injured in any way, they\\u2019d be closing in.\\xa0 We needed to reach him.</p>\\n<p>There were windows to either side, absent of glass, with boards in place.\\xa0 A sufficiently impact would probably get us through.\\xa0 We could ram past or try using our bodies.\\xa0 We couldn\\u2019t do either and devote the required attention to the ghosts behind us.</p>\\n<p>And if they\\u2019d trapped the front door, I wasn\\u2019t sure they hadn\\u2019t trapped the window.</p>\\n<p>I stared at the doorway, saw the rubble and the heap of detritus, the cloud of dust, the ladder sitting askew.</p>\\n<p>I touched my fist to Mary\\u2019s shoulder.\\xa0 I was gratified that she didn\\u2019t flinch or pull away like she had when I\\u2019d tried to hold her hand.\\xa0 I gestured, quick, a series of instructions.\\xa0 <em>Together.\\xa0 Push.\\xa0 You.\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 Push.\\xa0 Up.\\u201d</em></p>\\n<p>Then I grabbed her arm, pulling her alongside me, whistling to get the others\\u2019 attention.</p>\\n<p>We charged for the stairwell that they\\u2019d just dropped everything on.\\xa0 The razor wire was still potentially there, the footing was uncertain, and there was no guarantee there was even a path through, with the dust obscuring vision.\\xa0 If I was wrong, then we\\u2019d lose precious time, we\\u2019d open ourselves up to being attacked.</p>\\n<p>Except, much as we\\u2019d been cornered from the start, we were already in danger of being attacked.\\xa0 We had little to lose.</p>\\n<p>I threw my shoulder against the base of the ladder, to the left side of the door.\\xa0 Mary stepped up onto loose bricks and pushed the top.</p>\\n<p>There was a spring to the ladder as it pushed back, pressing against the razor wire, but the wire was only at knee height or below.\\xa0 By pushing my end, I kept it in place.\\xa0 Mary tipped it forward, so it leaned forward, landing on top of more razor wire and rubble further down the little staircase.\\xa0 The wire bit into wood and locked the ladder in place.</p>\\n<p>Before I was even standing, Helen was up, stepping onto the struts of the ladder, crossing the makeshift bridge.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d communicated to signal that the deadfalls and traps should be released, but their communication was simpler, limited in some of the same ways our hand signals were.\\xa0 When the order had gone out to release the trap, everyone had released it.\\xa0 Nothing was kept in reserve for when the rest of us poked our heads out and made a run for it.\\xa0 The trap had been sprung, and our exit into known difficulties here was safer and faster than any alternative.</p>\\n<p>Lillian and Jamie crossed too, losing a little speed as they made sure they didn\\u2019t slip or fall.\\xa0 Mary offered me a hand, and I gratefully accepted it.\\xa0 We crossed together, me a step behind her.</p>\\n<p>Catcher stood about twenty feet ahead of us, hunched over, bleeding from a wound to the face that had cut a deep notch into his high collar.\\xa0 Slices.\\xa0 His attackers weren\\u2019t anywhere to be seen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re okay?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPhysically?\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll take that as a yes,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cOur enemy doesn\\u2019t seem intent on playing fair.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>His hand moved.\\xa0 A signal.\\xa0 <em>Danger.\\xa0 Left.\\xa0 Left.\\xa0 Left.\\xa0 Right</em>.</p>\\n<p>Now that I looked, I could see them.\\xa0 The women stood so that only half of their faces were exposed, or the shadows embraced them.</p>\\n<p>Looking around, I identified the area as one that had burned in the fires around the time the war had started.\\xa0 Effort was being made to piece it together, but it was slow going, and resources had been diverted elsewhere.\\xa0 The result was that we were in an empty husk of a residential area.\\xa0 No residents, no \\u2018home\\u2019.\\xa0 Seeds and components for construction were everywhere, stacked in front of buildings and on either side of the streets, so that it was impossible to go more than three or four paces before reaching another pile of stone or wood or a crate of something.\\xa0 Cloths and treated canvases had been tied over many of the piles, light rain running off them.</p>\\n<p>Too many hiding places for the enemy, here.</p>\\n<p>Very naturally we fell into a position so that we stood in a circle, our backs to each other.</p>\\n<p>In answer, more of the women around us emerged.</p>\\n<p>It was a given that we\\u2019d be surrounded.\\xa0 They were fast.\\xa0 They knew the terrain.\\xa0 They would harass us, they\\u2019d punish recklessness by closing in on us and picking us off or making us bleed, and they\\u2019d punish us for biding our time by setting up traps in the periphery.</p>\\n<p>In execution and raw effectiveness, it was a big step up from Mary\\u2019s generation.\\xa0 Percy had a hand in this, but his wasn\\u2019t the only one.\\xa0 There was another, probably two or three more minds collaborating to make this work as it did.</p>\\n<p>I was starting to feel like we might not be okay, this time around.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not often that I\\u2019m stuck like this,\\u201d Catcher said, echoing my thoughts.</p>\\n<p>I did like the man.\\xa0 If the Lambs were my siblings, in a roundabout way, Catcher was an extended family member.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you thinking, Mary?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe replaced me.\\xa0 With <em>these</em>,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 There was a note of emotion to her voice, more anger and frustration than anything.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can\\u2019t catch them, we can\\u2019t pin them down.\\xa0 They\\u2019re <em>better </em>than me, and they outnumber us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re more experienced,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey have that damn echolocation trick,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey can dodge thrown knives.\\xa0 I\\u2019d be willing to trade my field practice for that trick.\\xa0 Probably.\\xa0 Maybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I watched the women, knew they were listening, and I didn\\u2019t care.\\xa0 They were staying still, watching from various vantage points and perches.\\xa0 Seven in total, in our immediate vicinity.\\xa0 Possibly one or two more in the upper floor of the building we\\u2019d just vacated, and one on the ground floor.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d already sussed out their attack pattern.\\xa0 They were pack hunters.\\xa0 They ran their prey down, always playing it safe, skirting the edges, remaining out of reach.\\xa0 It was an attack pattern devoid of one critical component.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey might know how to dodge a thrown knife,\\u201d I said, \\u201cBut they don\\u2019t seem to know how to throw them.\\xa0 If they did, they would have already.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd we\\u2019d be dead,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian made a small sound.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I watched as Mary\\u2019s posture changed.</p>\\n<p>She needed support in this.\\xa0 She needed reassurance, in an odd, hard-to-define way.</p>\\n<p>But Mary wasn\\u2019t supposed to be my focus.\\xa0 I cursed the way my brain was stumbling lately, and focused on the danger.</p>\\n<p>The arrangement of the women was lopsided.\\xa0 Seven I could see, a number more I couldn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Of the seven, four were lined up on top of or in the windows of buildings down the length of the street, almost in a row, and two were at the far end of the street.\\xa0 The other was standing in the middle of the street, opposite the other two, just in case.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDog signaled yet?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s not telepathic,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 He tightened his grip on his weapon, and his hand signal pointed the way to Dog.\\xa0 The line of four women was apparently intent on blocking our way to accessing Gordon and Dog.\\xa0 We\\u2019d have to pass between or under them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you still don\\u2019t have a scent on our target?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d he said gruff.\\xa0 His other hand indicated the end of the street.\\xa0 The two individuals were in our way.</p>\\n<p>Now we knew where Percy was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, you\\u2019re utterly useless,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t know why we brought you along.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWatch it, brat,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t suppose you have any clever ideas?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThinking,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Beside me, Mary was holding a throwing knife.\\xa0 I imagined it wasn\\u2019t solely for throwing, but also a reminder that she wasn\\u2019t inferior to our attackers.\\xa0 The knife wouldn\\u2019t be useful, when the ghosts were this very slippery.</p>\\n<p>Or was there another use?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d I said, holding out a hand.\\xa0 \\u201cKnife?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She started to reach out.</p>\\n<p>I caught her hand before she could reverse the direction of the knife to give me the handle.\\xa0 My heart was pounding.\\xa0 Shot in the dark, and I was tense, certain that, the moment I gave them <em>any</em> opening, they\\u2019d lash out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOther hand,\\u201d I said, without letting go of her fingers.</p>\\n<p>She gave me a sidelong glance.\\xa0 She brought her left hand my way.</p>\\n<p><em>Enemy.\\xa0 Speak.\\xa0 Around.\\xa0 Question.</em>\\xa0 I signaled.\\xa0 I suspected I knew the answer.</p>\\n<p>Beside me, Jamie confirmed.\\xa0 Not that he could hear the enemy\\u2019s communication, but he\\u2019d relayed to Helen, who could.</p>\\n<p>They were busy communicating.\\xa0 Chattering, planning.</p>\\n<p>I was holding Mary\\u2019s hand, which was holding the blade.\\xa0 Moving it, I touched the sharper edges of the blades together, and moved them against each other.</p>\\n<p>Nothing.</p>\\n<p>I let go of Mary\\u2019s hand.</p>\\n<p>She repeated the motion.\\xa0 This time she knew what she was trying to accomplish.</p>\\n<p>Blade against blade, sharpening, scraping.\\xa0 It was a sound that could put hair on end.</p>\\n<p>Every single one of the ghosts in the area turned their heads, fixating on Mary.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t even need to wait to see Jamie\\u2019s relay from Helen.\\xa0 I could sense the change in the air.\\xa0 I could almost breathe deeper, without feeling the tension or hearing that inaudible chatter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did you just do?\\u201d Catcher asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCommunicated on their level,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t think they liked it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary was smiling, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe make a break for Dog and Gordon.\\xa0 Group with them, then see if we can\\u2019t find our target.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My hand signals instructed differently.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s make this as difficult for them as possible,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I glanced casually down the length of the street.\\xa0 I saw a wrought-metal railing, indicated it to Mary, who passed it along to the others.</p>\\n<p>Another signal, counting down, and then we made a break for it.\\xa0 Toward Dog, the four women lurking on rooftops.</p>\\n<p>Collectively, our assailants vanished.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>We changed direction, heading for a point further up the street.\\xa0 Mary drew blade against blade, eliciting sounds we couldn\\u2019t necessarily hear.</p>\\n<p>I felt a sinking feeling as the women reappeared.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t disrupting them, and it wasn\\u2019t having an effect.\\xa0 Was it merely another sound to them?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCrap!\\u201d I swore.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie called out.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re different!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I had to glance over to look.\\xa0 I saw the women fading away, but the synchronicity was gone.\\xa0 They weren\\u2019t fading in and fading away in the same way.\\xa0 Not in a way that made them hard to count or helped them play off each other.</p>\\n<p>The sounds Mary was making were undoubtedly different from the sounds they made on their own, but it was a more unfamiliar sound, one that was on similar channels to their usual mode of communication.\\xa0 Anyone could hold a conversation with a guy in the corner shouting nonsense syllables, suffering only minor annoyance, but these women were young, in a sense.\\xa0 They were inexperienced.\\xa0 There was an opening, a vulnerability today that might not be there in a year.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCatcher,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat thing, you challenged me to find a use for it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat about it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGive it to Sy!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was a ring, sharp-edged, with a bit of a corkscrew coil on one side.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t even sure how to hold it without cutting myself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat am I doing with this thing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWindows!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Further up ahead were a set of shuttered windows, the glass so dusty they were almost opaque.</p>\\n<p>Clever Mary.</p>\\n<p>I veered to the right, closer to the window, holding out the edge of the ring as best as I could.</p>\\n<p>Metal screeched as it cut glass.\\xa0 It got a reaction from <em>Catcher</em>.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t see Helen\\u2019s reaction, because she was toward the tail end of the group, but I imagined it was the same.\\xa0 An unpleasant sound to anyone with a good sense of hearing.</p>\\n<p>We were covering ground now, and our assailants were faltering.\\xa0 They were able to keep up, but the confidence was gone.\\xa0 They appeared, flanking us, they taunted us, but they\\u2019d changed their pattern.\\xa0 It no longer seemed like they were everywhere, uncountable and unpredictable.\\xa0 They no longer were able to say, in their ultrasonic language, \\u2018I\\u2019m stepping out, someone else step in\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>But, at the end of the day, they were wired to take advantage of any gap in defenses.\\xa0 They were scavengers, picking off the weak and, apparently, the overconfident.</p>\\n<p>With a smoothness that proved deceptive, leading the eye to take a fraction longer to register it, one stepped out of the alleyway.</p>\\n<p>Helen was the first to react, shouting in alarm.\\xa0 Mary turned, raising her knives.\\xa0 I swiped hard at the nearest window, and the edge of the circular blade cut into the base of my palm, making the woman flinch.</p>\\n<p>The woman nonetheless drove her attack home.\\xa0 A length of pipe, sharp at one end.\\xa0 Her reach was longer, she was stronger, and Mary\\u2019s attempt to fend off the attack proved futile.\\xa0 She twisted around, trying to sidestep the attack, holding out the knives to keep it at a distance from herself, and the woman only took a longer stride, then thrust down and through.</p>\\n<p>Mary.</p>\\n<p><em>Injury added to insult, for Mary to be struck down by one of her successors.</em></p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019d always hated to lose, and to lose here, of all places?</em></p>\\n<p>Catcher lunged.\\xa0 Off balance, senses failing her, the brown-haired woman wasn\\u2019t even aware enough to see the attack coming.\\xa0 The mancatcher closed around her throat.\\xa0 She stumbled as Catcher moved the stick to force her to carry forward with her movement, and folded over his shin as he kicked her in the middle.</p>\\n<p>While she reeled, he repositioned her, and then kicked again, this time for the small of her back, snapping her back in two.</p>\\n<p>I caught up to Mary, who\\u2019d ceased running, and only stumbled, each step weaker than the last.\\xa0 I threw my arms around her before she could fall to the ground.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDumb,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJerk,\\u201d she said, voice already weak.</p>\\n<p>Catcher reached us.\\xa0 He relieved me of my burden, grabbing Mary with one arm, pole held in the other.\\xa0 As I stepped away, I felt the blood that had already welled out of the open wound.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRefuse to die,\\u201d Mary said, quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cSupposed to- have to look Percy in the eye.\\xa0 End him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not going to die,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian had caught up to us.\\xa0 She wasted no time in taking hold of the tear in Mary\\u2019s dress with both hands and hauling it open wider.</p>\\n<p>I was aware of the ghosts gathering around us.\\xa0 There was a feral edge to what they were doing, now.\\xa0 More disorganized, something about their body language and expressions that suggested we\\u2019d pushed them out of their comfort zone, and they were no longer content to bide their time.</p>\\n<p>Very similar to Mary in that way.\\xa0 Sometimes her blood got riled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCatcher,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Catcher was still holding Mary with one arm under and around her armpits.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t respond.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTell me Dog and Gordon are close?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey aren\\u2019t,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>There was no hand signal to go with the statement.\\xa0 He was telling the truth.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was gone, Mary was down.\\xa0 Helen, Lillian, Jamie and I weren\\u2019t fighters.</p>\\n<p>The ghosts were.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcuse me,\\u201d I told Mary, as I reached under her skirt.\\xa0 I knew just where to reach to unclip two lengths of razor wire from her underwear, blades strung along the length.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGave you your chance,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 There was a note to her voice, as if she was already delirious.</p>\\n<p>My expression was stone as I took a series of knives for myself and then handed the other to Jamie.</p>\\n<p>He gave me a look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope you\\u2019ve been watching Mary closely,\\u201d was all I said.</p>\\n<p>He gave me a curt nod.</p>\\n<p>I could see Lillian trying to tend to Mary, Catcher trying to make her job as easy as possible while being on guard for an attack, and I couldn\\u2019t pull my attention away from the scene to focus on the enemy.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t think along multiple tracks.\\xa0 I felt <em>stupid</em>, at a time I needed all my wits about me, and I felt even stupider because of the incoherent, violent emotion mixed into it all.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNobody\\u2019s dying today,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot like

wasn\\u2019t in his lab?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 One word answer.\\xa0 Preoccupied.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid you see him enter the lab?\\u201d\\xa0 I prodded her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 He left before I finished with Doctor Edith.\\xa0 The doctors were gone too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>More than one or two words, this time, at least.</p>\\n<p>I frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShould we wait inside?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s too hot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe stay here, where we agreed to meet him,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She groaned, long and loud.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBesides,\\u201d I said, gesturing in the direction of the security team at the base of the building, \\u201cDo we really want to have them run their hands and tentacles and noses all over us?\\xa0 Twice, since we\\u2019d have to go in and come back out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian made a different sound, groaning and moaning in disgust.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s not,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll be glad when the war\\u2019s over, and we don\\u2019t have to do it anymore.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie was more conscious about his appearance than any of us.\\xa0 He was private, and that privacy was violated several times a day.\\xa0 Worse, attention was drawn to his scars now and again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll work extra hard to make it happen,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cEnd the war sooner.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere he is,\\u201d Mary said, perking up a bit.</p>\\n<p>Gordon.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t in the building, but was coming from the Rise, the storage buildings and a few labs that were kept separate from the rest.</p>\\n<p>There were a lot of temporary buildings set up in that vicinity.\\xa0 As Gordon approached with Dog and Catcher in tow, he had a backdrop of very large creations and tents that only barely covered the warbeasts and projects within.\\xa0 These were projects that had very high metabolisms.\\xa0 Started small, highly efficient, they devoured food to grow into hulking beasts that would need the big gate to exit the Academy.\\xa0 They were placed near the Rise for easy access to food, and it was very possible to see one in the morning, then see one at night, and see a noticeable difference in size.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was talking to Catcher as he approached.\\xa0 They wrapped it up as they reached us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou disappeared on us,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHayle said Dog and Catcher were free.\\xa0 I figured I\\u2019d ask.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a good idea,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She raised her hand in a small wave.\\xa0 \\u201cHi.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHello,\\u201d Catcher said, with a voice like gravel.</p>\\n<p>Catcher was wearing a military jacket, his usual wide-brimmed hat replaced with a lopsided military cap with a fold at one side, the other laying flat.\\xa0 His high, modified collar and the skew of his hat left only his eyes visible, milky white and framed by scars that looked like old burns.\\xa0 He cut an imposing figure, shrouded in a long coat that hung open to reveal the curious and very sharp tools that were strapped to his chest.\\xa0 His mancatcher was strapped to his back.</p>\\n<p>Dog grunted, before making an unintelligible sound that might have been speech.\\xa0 He was outfitted for war, and had more rigging and hooks around his quadruped body that no doubt served to hold bags and containers, or armor, or other things in that vein, when he was out in the field.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat means \\u2018hello\\u2019,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Catcher confirmed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI figured as much,\\u201d Mary said, but she was smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShall we?\\u201d Gordon indicated the direction to the gate.\\xa0 We started walking as a group, many of us going without our umbrellas.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve already filled them in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary practically skipped to keep in step with Catcher and Gordon, her attention more on Catcher than anyone.\\xa0 Dog loped beside the group, long and large enough that Gordon walked beside his head, Helen walked behind Gordon, and I walked behind Helen, and I was only beside Dog\\u2019s left, back leg.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo establish the particulars, they\\u2019re fast,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re elusive.\\xa0 The trick is going to be finding them in the first place, and they know we\\u2019re onto them.\\xa0 I was talking to my team, well, they were talking at me and not saying anything I hadn\\u2019t heard before-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shrugged, a little too fast, not very convincing.\\xa0 Trying to seem more cavalier than he was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-and in the back of my mind, I was wondering what the next step was.\\xa0 How we find them and get ahead of them when they might be leaving, going into hiding, or completely changing how they operate.\\xa0 I thought of Dog and Catcher.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Distracting himself by focusing on the job?</p>\\n<p>What exactly had his research and development team been telling him?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re quiet today, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said, turning around.\\xa0 \\u201cThoughts?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was a little caught off guard.\\xa0 He\\u2019d interrupted my thoughts in much the same way I figured he would if I\\u2019d been speaking aloud.\\xa0 I took a second to think on the subject at hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust killing them won\\u2019t accomplish anything.\\xa0 We need to capture or follow them back to wherever they\\u2019re set up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d Catcher made a sound.\\xa0 He reached over his shoulder and grabbed his mancatcher, holding it with one hand, then unclipped his coat and reached behind his back to retrieve another head for the mancatcher.\\xa0 Where the head at the end of the thick pole formed a partial circle with teeth pointing in toward the center, the one he\\u2019d picked out had no teeth, but did have hooks pointing out and back, like a bull\\u2019s horns.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan I please see?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe haven\\u2019t talked, you and I,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m new.\\xa0 I joined a year and two months ago.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Catcher said, in the tone of an annoyed parent, with the actual voice of an elderly man who\\u2019d gargled iron filings.\\xa0 \\u201cTake off the head yourself, watch it, it\\u2019s heavy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He held the pole so it extended toward Mary.\\xa0 She caught it, and she grunted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTold you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t tell her how to remove it, but she figured it out quickly.\\xa0 She removed pins and then unscrewed the head from the pole, letting the circle hang off her wrist while she adjusted positions.\\xa0 She handed it to Catcher, getting the new head in return and as she turned to do it, I saw the look on her face.\\xa0 There was a light in her eye.</p>\\n<p>She was having fun.\\xa0 This was her midwinter present.\\xa0 A new toy.\\xa0 A small challenge.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm,\\u201d she made a noise, as she got the new head on.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI- uh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpeak,\\u201d he barked the order.</p>\\n<p>I almost laughed.\\xa0 It was a fitting command coming from someone who was partnered with a \\u2018Dog\\u2019.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt needs cleaning, and oiling, this part.\\xa0 The pins are halting as I put them in.\\xa0 If you wait-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t wait,\\u201d he interrupted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t want to insult you, saying something bad about your weapon.\\xa0 But-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re right.\\xa0 It needs attention.\\xa0 Lots of smaller parts and blood in the mechanisms.\\xa0 I ran out of cleaning supplies in the field.\\xa0 I was going to spend the day cleaning my tools.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Dog snorted, loud enough to startle bystanders.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think Dog agrees,\\u201d Gordon said, amused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaking me look bad in front of the children,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think you look bad,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHrmph,\\u201d Catcher grumped.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re a good one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary beamed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He extended the pole out further.\\xa0 The entire thing was too heavy for just Mary to hold, even with Catcher holding the spiked butt-end of the weapon, so Gordon took hold of the head, with Mary in the center, free to fiddle with it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow was the fighting?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t normally ask, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt could have been worse.\\xa0 We were kept busy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary used the lever.\\xa0 The head of the weapon closed, forming a complete circle that would typically have someone\\u2019s neck within it.\\xa0 She toyed with it, switching between open, closed, and locking it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Duke was giving the orders?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cAssigning you your missions?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave you met him?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 But there was a dialogue.\\xa0 He gave us tasks.\\xa0 We accomplished them.\\xa0 We would get one or two days to breathe or heal, then he would give us another set of tasks.\\xa0 A lot was said, in terms of expectations and results.\\xa0 I walked away thinking he knows what we\\u2019re comfortable doing better than the team that created us,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 He turned to Mary, \\u201cYou like it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen I was being trained, I learned to use and make a garrote on a pole, because I was expected to take down adults, and I can\\u2019t always reach the throat.\\xa0 I like this, it\\u2019s sort of the same, but it\\u2019s so clever!\\xa0 And satisfying when it closes.\\xa0 Like, <em>tch, tch,</em> it\\u2019s a solid sound.\\xa0 Do you have a silent one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It hadn\\u2019t been that long ago that she\\u2019d only been giving one word answers, and I\\u2019d had to squeeze longer sentences out of her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do have a silent one, and I do have cords, for when I need my target especially silent, too.\\xa0 When we stop to rest, I can get them out and show you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes please!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s earlier tractability was gone, replaced by her excitement.\\xa0 I suspected it would return, but there was a lot to be said for Mary being young, with her areas of interest.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like the Duke,\\u201d Catcher said, to the rest of us, as he took his weapon back from Gordon and Mary, strapping it to his back.\\xa0 \\u201cI would not want to be in the same room with him, or have to endure a conversation with him, but I like him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBased on the\\u2026 what, scraps of paper with written instruction?\\xa0 The \\u2018dialogue\\u2019 of job given and job completed?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cHis intuition and command?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It reminded me, in a way, of the dialogue between our group and Cynthia, as we\\u2019d engaged in the opening foray of strategy and counter-strategy between the forces of Westmore and those of Whitney.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d\\xa0 reached the gate, and the team there started hauling it open as soon as they saw our advance.</p>\\n<p>The team in charge of searches moved our way.</p>\\n<p>Dog rumbled, a low, long growl.\\xa0 He moved something, and metal slammed against metal on the far side of his body.\\xa0 His head swung to one side, to stare at the group.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know who we are,\\u201d Catcher called out.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t insult us to boost your own egos.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have orders to-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Shove</em> your orders,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>Their group stopped, watching as we kept walking.</p>\\n<p>I had a wide grin on my face, and turned to make sure they saw it before picking up my stride to catch back up with the others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t hang out nearly enough,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Catcher chuckled.</p>\\n<p>It was a bit of a walk to the area we\\u2019d last seen Percy and his \\u2018ghosts\\u2019.\\xa0 Conversation continued, sporadic, sometimes the entire group falling silent, just walking and feeling far too warm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow\\u2019s your bum?\\u201d Lillian asked Helen.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s not sore?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHolding together?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, thank you,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>Silence.\\xa0 Somewhat awkward silence.</p>\\n<p>I eventually broke the silence to ask, \\u201cDid anyone else feel a compulsion to say or do something <em>immensely</em> inappropriate when the Duke was staring us down?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Everyone present, Dog and Catcher included, gave me horrified looks.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNone of us, then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t even joke,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m just saying-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t even entertain the thought.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut if you were to pass wind, just really quiet, but long and quiet, so everyone knew what was happening-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Lillian cut in, voice a little tight. \\u201cPlease.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr if someone dropped trou?\\xa0 Stared him in the eye, like it was any other day?\\xa0 Don\\u2019t you wonder if he would be so amazed at the audacity of the act that he\\u2019d reward it?\\xa0 It\\u2019s got to be boring, with everyone always saying yes-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Gordon cut in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIgnore him,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe was as spooked as any of us.\\xa0 He\\u2019s just using the situation to get a reaction out of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were one or two chuckles and a few names thrown my way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpoilsport,\\u201d I muttered to Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re already on edge,\\u201d he muttered.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy make it worse?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNevermind,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know the answer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned at him.</p>\\n<p>His expression remained placid.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the answer?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>His lips firmly pressed together.</p>\\n<p>I jabbed him in the stomach.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that at your collarbone?\\u201d Mary was asking Catcher.\\xa0 \\u201cThe metal thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt goes into the eye socket.\\xa0 Pinch it like this to open it up, hooks go under the eyelids, prying the eye open, and you release, and the rest sits against the socket.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy would you need to pry someone\\u2019s eyes open?\\xa0 Well, I mean, I can think of reasons, but why not just have a knife?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor psychological effect.\\xa0 To make them watch what I do to their friend.\\xa0 Or I can hold their head still, and let water droplets fall on the open eye.\\xa0 The eyes are the window to the soul.\\xa0 Pry at the eyes, and you can shake the soul.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat is <em>so</em>\\u2026 oh wow.\\xa0 The way you said it, even.\\xa0 And that one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSlide it into an opening, turn the dial\\u2026 it unfolds from a tube to a sphere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd that one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I jumped in, \\u201cIt\\u2019s what he uses to pick his teeth.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary half-turned.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t see what I\\u2019m pointing at, can you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause if you could, you\\u2019d get how funny that was,\\u201d she said, and she allowed me a small smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUproariously funny, apparently,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She rolled her eyes, turning back to Catcher.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll see if you can figure out what it\\u2019s for, by the end of the task at hand,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>Dog made a sound, garbled, a jaw of metal and wires and oversized teeth, not quite made for speaking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s he saying?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIgnore him,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>Dog \\u2018spoke\\u2019 again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what that means,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>Dog \\u2018harumphed\\u2019, which was a pretty impressive sound coming from something as big as he was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright, alright,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cFine.\\xa0 Spend this much time with someone, they lose all patience.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe spend all of our time together, pretty much,\\u201d I pointed out.</p>\\n<p>Catcher ignored me.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s for.\\xa0 I thought it looked intimidating.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary laughed, and the sound caught me off guard.</p>\\n<p>Beside me, in a low voice, Jamie spoke, \\u201cYou okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFine,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause you don\\u2019t seem fine.\\xa0 The way you\\u2019re holding yourself, the way you\\u2019re talking\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo problems.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour jokes are falling a little flat.\\xa0 You\\u2019re talking less.\\xa0 Teasing less.\\xa0 You were moving a little less fluidly, when we were chasing.\\xa0 I know because I watched you.\\xa0 I\\u2019m pretty sure <em>everyone</em> sees the way you\\u2019re interacting with Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary\\u2019s a different thing,\\u201d I said, with a fierce whisper, my volume minimal.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know she\\u2019s a different thing.\\xa0 But she\\u2019s a thing that I think the <em>real</em> Sy would be more on top of.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gave him a look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know what I mean.\\xa0 Actually, I\\u2019m surprised you know what <em>you</em> mean.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie, come on.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve seen the sheep and horses go at it.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve seen cats, and there were the warbeasts, too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t start by comparing yourself to a horse or a warbeast, Sy.\\xa0 That road leads to tears.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve lost track of what you\\u2019re talking about, but I\\u2019ll try to keep that in mind,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI started this off asking if you were okay, but I only just now realized you successfully changed the topic and distracted me, which means you\\u2019re not too bad off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust a little bad off,\\u201d I murmured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause of Mary, or because of\\u2026?\\u201d he made a syringe motion toward his head, depressing the invisible plunger with his thumb.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGirls, poison, what\\u2019s the difference?\\u201d I whispered.</p>\\n<p>Helen, walking in front of me, turned to give me a look.\\xa0 Those sharp ears of hers.\\xa0 Beside her, Lillian turned, looking between Helen and I quizzically.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you\\u2019re the best kind,\\u201d I told Helen.</p>\\n<p>She sniffed, turning forward.\\xa0 \\u201cI hope so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The confusion on Lillian\\u2019s face redoubled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou more than anyone, Lil,\\u201d I said, smiling.</p>\\n<p>Her eyes narrowed, she turned away, then shot me another look, as if she could\\u2019ve caught me smirking at her back.</p>\\n<p>I smirked when she was done.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe <em>really</em> need to get you an appointment,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBefore you get yourself in trouble, trying to be funny.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHate to admit you\\u2019re right,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey said I could have had <em>my</em> appointment, but I convinced them to put it off, because I knew the rest of you wouldn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Better to do it all at once, so the Lambs aren\\u2019t shorthanded.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood.\\xa0 I\\u2019m glad to have you with us.\\u201d\\xa0 I clapped a hand on his shoulder.\\xa0 He smiled.</p>\\n<p>We were all the way down King street, and now, like the veins and arteries in a human body, things were starting to break down into smaller streets.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHereabouts,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re looking for specific smells,\\u201d I said, \\u201cAcademy carriage, or something made to look like one, stitched horses.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToo common on these streets, both,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChild, drugged, in the carriage,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnclosed?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToo muffled an odor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBlood,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI threw a knife at one of the beasts at a checkpoint, it attacked the horses.\\xa0 I had another knife hit Percy, at the front.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t-\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She stopped herself.</p>\\n<p>And, though I was only able to see occasional glimpses of her face as I watched her, I could see her attitude shift.\\xa0 The glitter of pretty stabby torture things and the glamour of spiked mechanical confinement tools were only meager bandages for a bigger wound.</p>\\n<p>She hadn\\u2019t finished her sentence, and the answers that my mind supplied weren\\u2019t kind ones.</p>\\n<p><em>I wasn\\u2019t sure it was him?\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t want to hurt him?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cBleeding stitched is more distinct,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 Dog bobbed his oversized head in a ponderous nod, the metal at his jaw clicking and rattling as he switched from moving his head down to lifting it and vice versa.\\xa0 \\u201cBleeding man and bleeding stitched?\\xa0 That\\u2019s a starting point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Dog swung his head one way, then the other.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd he\\u2019s got the scent,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcellent,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He was smiling.</p>\\n<p>Metal at dog\\u2019s face shifted, covering his nose.\\xa0 That metal moved, slats opening to let the air in, closing as he moved his head, then opening again when he stopped it.</p>\\n<p>He turned to Catcher, then huffed, a blast of hot breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot it,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 He tilted his head to one side.\\xa0 \\u201cThere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Dog started moving, loping forward.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not running?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen we\\u2019re closer.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t worry,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cVery few slip away when we have the trail.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We backtracked a bit, then headed down a side street.\\xa0 The buildings here were more apartment than anything else, with the occasional shop on the lower floors.\\xa0 Bakeries, butcheries, furniture stores.\\xa0 The balconies weren\\u2019t as clustered together as the ones in the shims, which suggested larger residences, but the area wasn\\u2019t quite <em>nice</em>.\\xa0 It just wasn\\u2019t awful.\\xa0 A step up from the shims.</p>\\n<p>Jamie whistled under his breath, then gestured.</p>\\n<p>In the time it took our collective heads to turn, the blonde woman in the window ducked out of view, only a flash of pale hair visible for an eyes\\u2019 blink of time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWant to chase?\\u201d Catcher asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not fast enough,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re quick.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you?\\u201d Mary asked Catcher, \\u201cWant to chase?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 I thought you\\u2019d want something to do.\\xa0 It\\u2019s your job, we\\u2019re just helping,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOur job.\\xa0 We share the credit if this goes well, we Lambs suffer any consequences if it goes bad,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSays <em>Gordon</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHeck no.\\xa0 I totally want the credit.\\xa0 But if Dog and Catcher want to take some of the blame, I\\u2019m not going to whine about it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a good thing I know you\\u2019re joking,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAm I?\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t realize.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie made another small whistle, gesturing.</p>\\n<p>The Japanese woman, also on lookout, this time on a rooftop.\\xa0 Once she realized we\\u2019d spotted her, she moved, falling back to a position where we couldn\\u2019t see her.</p>\\n<p>The situation had reversed from what we\\u2019d faced before.\\xa0 This time, they were the ones on watch, we were the ones encroaching on their territory.\\xa0 We wanted to make away with a captive we could squeeze for information, if we couldn\\u2019t get to Percy himself.\\xa0 They\\u2019d wanted to make away with a child.</p>\\n<p>We didn\\u2019t make it another half-block before Mary moved, pointing with a knife-tip.</p>\\n<p>The red-haired woman.\\xa0 Inside a window.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>Collectively, the group stopped moving.</p>\\n<p>The woman was already fading into the shadows within the unlit apartment.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGhosts,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cI can\\u2019t hear them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Dog shook his head.</p>\\n<p>Catcher spoke again, \\u201cI can hear most footsteps, can hear some from a distance like this if I focus.\\xa0 I\\u2019m focusing and I don\\u2019t hear them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Dog said something garbled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou do?\\u201d Catcher asked.</p>\\n<p>Dog grunted an affirmative.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFootsteps?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Dog shook his head.\\xa0 Spoke in that mishmash of sounds and metal against metal that only Catcher and sometimes Gordon could understand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA high sound,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cToo high for even my ears.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr mine,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>Dog raised one paw, an amalgamation of flesh with metal supporting and replacing the flesh where it hadn\\u2019t grown in strong enough, bobbing it in time with noise we couldn\\u2019t hear.\\xa0 Up up, down, up up, down down down, up\\u2026</p>\\n<p>A conductor to a silent orchestra.</p>\\n<p>The paw came down, the claws themselves clacking like so many spurs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSilence?\\u201d Catcher asked.</p>\\n<p>Dog nodded slowly, head craning, vents on the lower face opening and closing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>The Japanese woman.\\xa0 On another rooftop.\\xa0 She\\u2019d managed to cross the street in front of us and travel a distance that would have taken another person four or five minutes, and she\\u2019d done it in half that, without being seen.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t budge from her position, halfway down the street, at the top of a flat rooftop.\\xa0 The wind stirred her damp hair and black dress.</p>\\n<p>No.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cI\\u2019m a little spooked.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s good,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 My eyes were wide, searching, my senses pitched to a painful sharpness.\\xa0 \\u201cSensible reaction.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t think they were <em>that</em> fast.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re not,\\u201d I said, just as Dog began shaking his head.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s more than three of them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie pointed to the other side of the street.</p>\\n<p>A brunette.\\xa0 Same clothes, same demeanor, same look in her eyes.</p>\\n<p>The next building over, another Japanese woman, identical to the one who stood on the flat rooftop.</p>\\n<p>We shifted positions, our backs to one another, shoulder to shoulder, searching the area.</p>\\n<p>They stepped out of hiding, one after the other.\\xa0 There was a petite one with dark hair, who I saw four different versions of, another blonde, two more redheads\\u2026 those were only the ones in the direction I was facing.</p>\\n<p>Dog raised his paw, bobbed it, then dropped it to the street.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re talking,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 Dog nodded confirmation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey communicate with whistles?\\xa0 Too high frequency for any human to hear?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cA unique language?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo it seems,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo many of them,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>Mary was silent, her expression dark.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCommunicating like that\\u2026 they\\u2019re pack hunters,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo it seems, yes,\\u201d Catcher repeated himself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t get separated,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBest thing we can do-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHold on,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHold on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Silence reigned for a long few seconds.\\xa0 The women gathered around us were all utterly still.</p>\\n<p>I felt like I <em>could</em> hear the high pitched sound, but I couldn\\u2019t.\\xa0 But something was setting my teeth on edge, making my head hurt.</p>\\n<p>I raised a hand, snapping my fingers.</p>\\n<p>When the others looked at me out of the corners of their eyes, I gestured, fierce.</p>\\n<p><em>Silent.\\xa0 Around, enemy scout</em>.</p>\\n<p>Or, in context, <em>be quiet.\\xa0 They can hear us.</em></p>\\n<p>Hear what we say to each other, plan or counter-plan accordingly.</p>\\n<p>Gordon raised his hand, snapped once, gestured.</p>\\n<p><em>Leader chase.\\xa0 I group dog.\\xa0 You go.\\xa0 </em></p>\\n<p>There were two options.\\xa0 To decide we were in over our heads, or to go for the leader.</p>\\n<p>Gordon wanted to go for the leader.\\xa0 He\\u2019d group up with Dog.\\xa0 The rest of us, Catcher included, would take another path.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t technically disagree with the idea.\\xa0 The ghosts were coordinated enough to make use of any weakness or opportunity our splitting up afforded to them, but Gordon and Dog together could be fast, and I trusted them to be effective, for the most part.</p>\\n<p>Yet his left hand, at his side, was partially clenched, ring and middle finger extended, and the middle finger bobbled up and down as if it wasn\\u2019t under his control.\\xa0 He was holding it between himself and Mary as if he hoped to keep it out of people\\u2019s view.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d I spoke aloud.\\xa0 He looked at me.\\xa0 I glanced down at his hand.\\xa0 \\u201cYou sure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPerfectly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t believe him at all.</p>\\n<p>It was such an awful situation.\\xa0 When I had to extend trust to someone or lose <em>their</em> trust.\\xa0 It took a great power balance and upset it, because it wasn\\u2019t a thing that happened <em>once</em>.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Gordon and Fray, Mary and Percy.</p>\\n<p>He gestured.\\xa0 Our gestures for numbers were what they were for much this reason.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t intuitive.</p>\\n<p><em>Three.\\xa0 Two.\\xa0 One</em>.</p>\\n<p>He grabbed onto Dog\\u2019s armor, hauling himself up, heading right.\\xa0 The rest of us ran forward, down the length of the street.</p>\\n<p>Silent, without fanfare or theatrics, the ghostly sentries of this neck of Radham slid away.\\xa0 Not all into shadow, but perfectly out of view.\\xa0 It was as if they knew where every single one of our blind spots were, every piece of cover that would serve.</p>\\n<p>Percy was injured.\\xa0 He\\u2019d be patching himself up, if he wasn\\u2019t already done, and as hurt people tended to do, he would be inclined to find shelter, return home.</p>\\n<p>The enemy wasn\\u2019t the only wild card in this game, not fully understood as a group.\\xa0 Mary counted as one.\\xa0 Gordon counted as another.</p>\\n<p>Catcher leading the way, Mary at the rear corner of our triangle formation, Helen at the other corner, we ran, making a break for the weakest link, the critical target.</p>\\n<p><em>A leap of faith, then another, then another.</em></p>\\n<p><a

my arms around him, pinning his arms to their sides.\\xa0 Mary joined me, clapping a hand over his mouth, her other hand making sure he didn\\u2019t drop his book.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmph.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need your eyes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmph?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We led him over to the window.\\xa0 Helen was already standing by the window with Lillian.\\xa0 We were on the second floor of Claret Hall, overlooking one of the grassy open spaces where students were eating their lunches, most doing it while looking over papers, making notes, or having discussions.\\xa0 Always working, working, working.</p>\\n<p>A canopy of slanted glass panes set between interwoven branches directed the rainwater onto stylized grates, with the water disappearing into some underground reservoir.\\xa0 There was a steady patter of rain, but it was also a hot summer day, making for the kind of humidity where clothing stuck to the body.\\xa0 Gordon was there, sitting on a bench beneath a tree, unfolded paper on his knee, a partially eaten sandwich in hand.\\xa0 Shipman was on the other end of the short bench, arm\\u2019s length from Gordon.\\xa0 Brown bottles of Sassafras Beer had been placed on top of Shipman\\u2019s papers as a kind of paperweight.\\xa0 Meeting for lunch, between their individual tasks.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re better at lipreading than I am,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy am I lipreading?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cTheir breakup has

\\u201cIf we know, we can tailor how we respond to him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded enthusiastically.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr,\\u201d Jamie pointed out, \\u201cWe can let him decide how and when he wants to let us know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re talking,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She grabbed Mary\\u2019s arm.\\xa0 \\u201cMary, Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m looking,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m watching.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie sighed.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t walk away, though.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been thinking,\\u201d Mary recited, her voice

in \\u2018Gordon voice\\u2019, then switched for Shipman.\\xa0 \\u201cGordon\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She trailed off, apparently struggling to figure out the words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m a big

\\u201cI don\\u2019t know the right word.\\xa0 But a relationship should be about being secure with one another and not having to apologize.\\xa0 There should be that security.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI wanted this to be a positive thing for both of us, but it doesn\\u2019t feel that way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>They were taking turns now.\\xa0 Mary for Gordon and Jamie for Shipman.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is going a lot better than I thought it would,\\u201d I remarked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh,\\u201d Lillian shushed me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s to your credit,\\u201d Shipman/Jamie said, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t think this would be anything serious.\\xa0 You saved me, back in the dungeons, with Sub Rosa.\\xa0 I was curious about you and your friends and I thought I\\u2019d humor you, but I actually liked you quite a bit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPast tense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve never been good at

against the tree behind the bench.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen you went to Whitney, I shouldn\\u2019t have gone with you,\\u201d Shipman/Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think so?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToo much time around each other, woke me up to how different we were.\\xa0 The world you lived in.\\xa0 If I\\u2019d been ignorant, we could have stayed together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe still wouldn\\u2019t have been a perfect fit.\\xa0 Only difference is it would have taken us longer to figure out,\\u201d Gordon/Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe that\\u2019s true.\\xa0 So is that it?\\xa0 We\\u2019re over?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like to work with you in the future.\\xa0 I respect the work you do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Shipman reached over, touching Gordon\\u2019s cheek.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething something fatter girl?\\xa0 Her head was turned,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know how to flatter a girl,\\u201d I guessed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd now she\\u2019s saying, \\u2018If you find another girl and she needs a reference, send her my way?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think relationships work that way, Gladys,\\u201d Gordon/Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd they\\u2019re laughing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>They were.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is going a <em>lot</em> better than I thought it would,\\u201d I remarked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou sound glad,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI <em>am.\\xa0 Really.</em>\\xa0 I thought Gordon would charge the problem head-on, offend Gladys, and this whole thing would end in tears.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t give him enough slack,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou haven\\u2019t for a while now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m just saying.\\xa0 Gordon is a problem solver.\\xa0 When he solves problems, he does it in ways that keep that problem solved.\\xa0 Hammer through the brainpan, broken legs, smashed glass\\u2026\\xa0 even social problems, he likes his firm solutions.\\xa0 His handling of this is a lot more delicate than I would have expected.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re all evolving,\\u201d Lillian remarked.</p>\\n<p>It was a strange statement, coming from the only one of us who wasn\\u2019t augmented, altered, or inhuman.</p>\\n<p>Gordon raised his bottle of beer and clinked it with Gladys\\u2019.\\xa0 The pair weren\\u2019t smiling, but they weren\\u2019t upset either.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are the rules for this?\\u201d Mary said, in her Gordon voice.\\xa0 \\u201cBreaking up?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can be civil to each other, say hi when we cross paths?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSee?\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFirm, solid solutions.\\xa0 Making sure everything is settled.\\xa0 Very Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShh!\\u201d Lillian shushed me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Shipman/Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can be civil.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStay in touch?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd, if there\\u2019s someone else, somewhere down the road, there won\\u2019t be any\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHurt feelings,\\u201d Jamie supplied.</p>\\n<p>Gladys was smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you already have your eyes on another girl, sir?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 But I want to make the most\\u2026\\u201d Mary started.\\xa0 She hesitated.\\xa0 \\u201c\\u2026of the time I have, and I don\\u2019t want to hurt you or anyone else if I happen to move on more quickly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Shipman reached out, touching Gordon\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p>The group was quiet.\\xa0 Shipman and Gordon talked for a solid ten or fifteen seconds, and there was no translation via. lipreading.</p>\\n<p>My heart felt uncomfortably weighty in my chest.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t just the words, the idea behind what he\\u2019d said.\\xa0 That he\\u2019d told her, that he\\u2019d changed the mood to do it?\\xa0 He\\u2019d been holding on to that.\\xa0 He\\u2019d needed to express himself, share that, and he had chosen Shipman over the rest of us, to do it.</p>\\n<p>I saw Shipman\\u2019s body language change.\\xa0 She was using her hands more, and her volume had raised a fraction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait, what\\u2019s she saying?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary had a hand to her face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe said she might introduce him to someone, what kind of girl does he like?\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe said he wanted someone more mature.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I slapped my hand to my own face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe was asking him what he means by that, she\\u2019s two years older than him, he said two and a half, she said she wanted to know what he meant, was she immature?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon, Gordon, Gordon,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe says no, that\\u2019s not what he meant.\\xa0 He meant he would be more interested in someone who knew how to handle themselves in a situation like we had in Westmore, and now they\\u2019re arguing.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t really feel comfortable trying to figure out exactly what they\\u2019re saying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe was doing so well,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGuess we\\u2019re not evolving that much after all?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe are,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut\\u2026 journey of a thousand steps, I guess.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Shipman stood up, snatched up her drink and the papers she\\u2019d brought with her, letting Gordon\\u2019s drink fall to the ground.\\xa0 She turned on her heels and stalked off.\\xa0 Gordon remained sitting.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSad thing is, he\\u2019s a brilliant guy,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm hmm,\\u201d Mary made a sound of agreement.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re all idiots, when it comes to first romances,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>Every head present turned to face her, a little caught off guard at the profound statement, coming from <em>Helen</em> of all people.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSpeaking from experience, Helen?\\u201d Jamie asked, very carefully.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNope!\\xa0 No romance here, and there never will be.\\xa0 Instead, I get the-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop,\\u201d I said, putting my hands out to mash her mouth shut, both of my palms pressing against the lower half of her face.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t finish that statement.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her eyebrows furrowed into a frown.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause it\\u2019s going to be weird and disconcerting,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cLet the rest of us live in ignorance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.</p>\\n<p>I released her mouth.</p>\\n<p>Down on the bench, Gordon picked up his fallen drink, wiped dirt from the glass, then tipped it back to finish it off.\\xa0 He folded up the paper he\\u2019d wrapped his sandwich in and set it aside with the bottle, one hand resting on it to keep it from blowing away.\\xa0 He heaved out a deep, profound sigh.</p>\\n<p>A moment later, he reached out to touch his thigh.\\xa0 He rubbed it, hard, as if he was trying to rub the bone beneath the muscle, then doubled over a little, expression changing, eyes shut, jaw clenched.</p>\\n<p>I turned my back to the window, and Jamie did the same.\\xa0 I saw Mary staring, and touched her arm, steering her away.</p>\\n<p>Too personal.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI should help him,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing you can do,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019d be more upset that you came to help than thankful.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s my job to look after you.\\xa0 All of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLeaving him be is looking after him,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cWith Gordon, if he doesn\\u2019t ask for help, he\\u2019ll resent it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s stupid,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>I shrugged.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019ll get looked after during his next appointment,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s going,\\u201d Helen observed.\\xa0 She was right.\\xa0 Gordon was limping just a little, but he seemed able to walk it off, or at least pretend it wasn\\u2019t a problem.\\xa0 By the time he reached the end of the field, his umbrella going up to shield him from the rain as he passed from under the canopy, he was walking normally.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s catch up with him.\\xa0 Drag him out to the city,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>There was no argument.\\xa0 We moved as a group, down the hallway, passing the occasional student.\\xa0 People were wearing their summer uniforms, but even the people proudest of their lab coats and the prestige those coats afforded them had doffed the things, leaving them in offices and dorm rooms.</p>\\n<p>Passing outside, though, the heat was like a physical wave of water, except this wave smelled like hospitals, blood, and that vague pungent smell of fresh manure.\\xa0 The opposite of refreshing, really.\\xa0 It made me feel disgusting the moment it swept over me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBlahhh,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>We walked the gauntlet, no less than five different experiments sniffing, touching, or waving digits at each of us.\\xa0 Prehensile limbs, antennae, and long-fingered hands gave us each a thorough search.\\xa0 One limb snaked through the armhole of my shirt, before sliding down my back, sweeping sweat free.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOw,\\u201d Mary said, as long fingers tugged at a knife she\\u2019d worked into her hair.\\xa0 \\u201cCareful, you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Other fingers from the same lumpy figure poked at knives resting flat against the small of her back, the outlines just barely exposed by the humidity-soaked clothing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m reaching for a badge,\\u201d she said, moving slowly, talking to the Academy student who was overseeing the things.\\xa0 She raised the badge, to show the man.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet them on through,\\u201d he said, sounding disinterested.</p>\\n<p>The morass of various creatures that had investigated us were quick to listen.\\xa0 I wondered if they had human brains in there, or if someone had gone to the effort of making a nonhuman brain that understood speech.</p>\\n<p>We walked, and half of us didn\\u2019t flip up our hoods or raise umbrellas.\\xa0 I was part of that half.\\xa0 It was so humid that I figured I\\u2019d be dripping anyway, and at least the rainwater was a <em>cleaner</em> dripping.</p>\\n<p>Hot as it was, the Academy was far from sluggish.\\xa0 People milled this way and that, hurrying, all with things to do.\\xa0 The population was different, too.\\xa0 Before Fray\\u2019s war had erupted, there had been perhaps a ten to one ratio of ordinary people to experiments or stitched, not counting ourselves.\\xa0 Now it felt like half-and-half.\\xa0 Unlike Dame Cicely\\u2019s, however, there were two discrete groups.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t student paired with experiment, but whole groups of experiments, weapons of war, and regiments of stitched, churned out and ready to be carted off somewhere.\\xa0 Specially constructed wagons carried the resources that would go toward making more.\\xa0 Cart upon cart of food for feeding the newest and greatest weapons of war.\\xa0 The students were cogs in this machine, heads down, their thoughts on their work and the expectations of their superiors.</p>\\n<p>We walked with purpose too, but our goal was to find Gordon before he went and disappeared off on his own.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was walking, oblivious to the rest of reality.\\xa0 We caught up with him, falling into formation, walking as a group in the most natural way imaginable.\\xa0 He arched an eyebrow as he looked at me, to his left, and Mary to his right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAppointments?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot yet,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cSorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy would you be sorry?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm.\\xa0 Because I know you probably want to get back to work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGetting away wouldn\\u2019t be so bad,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe some place by water, where we can swim in this kind of heat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat sounds nice,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019d need swim clothes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re going into the town,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWant to come with?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>We reversed direction, to pass around Claret Hall.\\xa0 The concentration of experiments and idle weapons of war was even greater, and the air was heavy with smells that I couldn\\u2019t entirely place.</p>\\n<p>The Duke was there, and as royalty, he was surrounded by a guard of sorts.\\xa0 The gauntlet of creatures investigating each and every person that came or went was part of it.\\xa0 Some of the weapons were top of the line, too.\\xa0 Two giants were sitting on either side of the door.\\xa0 Skinless, with three or four layers of muscle and bone set atop one another, with gaps suggesting what lay beneath.\\xa0\\xa0 Humanoid warbeasts, capable of using weapons.\\xa0 Probably from another Academy.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t move much, probably to reduce the amount of resources they consumed.</p>\\n<p>As we approached the gate beside the Hedge, we were subjected to another battery of searches.\\xa0 As the tentacles and prehensile noses stretched toward her, Mary heaved out a sigh.</p>\\n<p>For my part, I got the one with a sense of humor.\\xa0 It prodded at my face, repeatedly, apparently aiming for my nose and eye.\\xa0 I squinted and tilted my head a few times, dodging the pokes.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t begrudge it that, though.\\xa0 If the roles were reversed, I would have annoyed people all I could, knowing there was nothing they could do about it.</p>\\n<p>I snapped my teeth as it got too close, again.\\xa0 As the experiment overseer rose from his seat, I drew my badge.</p>\\n<p>He waved us on through, the search ending prematurely.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo glad I got these,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAren\\u2019t you glad I got these?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re glossing over the amount of trouble those badges caused us, when you picked them,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cShort term trouble, long term gain.\\xa0 Seriously, how much trouble have these badges spared us?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t make up for it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He reached out for me, probably to muss up my hair, but I dodged his hand.</p>\\n<p>Normally he would\\u2019ve got me anyway.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Slower to move.\\xa0 Was his leg still bothering him?</p>\\n<p>I made a mental note of that.</p>\\n<p>We made our way down the path, past Lambsbridge Orphanage, and into the city proper.</p>\\n<p>It, too, had changed over the months we\\u2019d been away.\\xa0 With a given job taking weeks or months, a brief visit back home to report in, then another job taking weeks or months, we\\u2019d only really seen glimpses of the transition.\\xa0 Now we were back, there was no job waiting for us, and we had more of a chance to take it in.</p>\\n<p>If there was a fifty-fifty split of people to experiments in Radham Academy, it was even more pronounced in the city.\\xa0 An experiment on every corner, armed, uniformed stitched walking the streets in pairs, and more choking the street itself.\\xa0 Some buildings had been torn down or retrofitted, the new buildings grown for expediency\\u2019s sake, leafless branches still spearing up and out, the building features themselves vague: too-narrow windows, lumpy protrusions around where the doors had been set in.\\xa0 It was thick material, clumsy in construction, but it was durable.</p>\\n<p>Military emplacements, placed at regular intervals.</p>\\n<p>The Academy was often described as being laid out like a living thing.\\xa0 The spread of Radham around it was little different.\\xa0 But this was a living thing which was trying to anticipate an attack from within.\\xa0 An uprising, sabotage, revolt.\\xa0 How did a body protect against such things?\\xa0 Antibodies.</p>\\n<p>The effect on the city was oppressive \\u2013 no doubt intended.\\xa0 Should there be another Mauer-like issue, Radham was fully prepared to squash it.\\xa0 But there was such a thing as an overactive immune system.\\xa0 The body could rebel.\\xa0 Things could start falling apart.\\xa0 The system originally meant to protect the body could destroy it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere are we going?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m open to whatever,\\u201d I said, \\u201cBut I thought we could visit an old haunt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought you were up to something,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 Who?\\xa0 Me?\\xa0 No.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have this way about you when you\\u2019re being sly, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamnable lies.\\xa0 I know that psychological trick.\\xa0 You convince someone they have a tell, and they work so hard to reverse it that they develop one.\\xa0 I\\u2019m pretty sure I told you about that, even.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, uh huh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d I mimicked him.\\xa0 \\u201cNope, you\\u2019re wrong.\\xa0 There are other reasons for this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah?\\xa0 I break up with a girl and before I even figure out how I feel about it, you guys come out of the woodwork to show me special attention?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He narrowed his eyes at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou broke up with Gladys?\\u201d Lillian asked, feigning surprise.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think she could have sounded less convincing if she\\u2019d spoken in a monotone.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a <em>knowing</em> look this time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey, Lil,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t call me that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour fault he knows we know.\\xa0 I\\u2019m obliged to punish you,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 No.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething slimy down the back of your shirt, maybe?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>No.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr an ice cube in your underpants, <em>Lil</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\xa0 No!\\xa0 I don\\u2019t even know how you would, but no!\\xa0 Don\\u2019t you dare.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr something in your ear\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t let him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m just really fascinated by the insight into how Sy thinks,\\u201d Jamie said, his voice dry.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s all very <em>physical</em> torments, two out of three for getting under Lillian\\u2019s clothes, no less.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s fascinating,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait,\\u201d I said, \\u201cHold up.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re tormenting Lil here, not me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The discussion continued, with a lot of back and forth and everyone getting their turn as the one made fun of.\\xa0 We were interrupted as we had to pass through a waypoint to get from one district to another.\\xa0 Another brief search and questioning.\\xa0 A mark made in a book.</p>\\n<p>Into the shims.\\xa0 The more dilapidated end of Radham.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSame old markings,\\u201d Gordon said, touching a wall.\\xa0 The wood had been carved with a triangle, given two eyes and two circles for ears.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNostalgic,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat does it mean?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSafe spot for the young,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cEvery generation or so, you\\u2019ll get a group that look after each other, not as an organized thing, but it\\u2019ll just happen.\\xa0 Because there\\u2019s too many kids who don\\u2019t have a good reason to go home and they have to spend their time with <em>someone</em>.\\xa0 Every other generation or so, you\\u2019ll get someone who \\u2018makes it\\u2019.\\xa0 Who has a shop or a house or something and they aren\\u2019t hard up for cash, and who looks after kids.\\xa0 The mouse is for places like that, or for groups that\\u2019ll look after you if you\\u2019re young.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.\\xa0 She\\u2019d left her hood down, and her hair was wet.\\xa0 She brought her hands up to tuck wet hair behind her ears.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree triangles for a fox,\\u201d Gordon gestured at the corner of one building, near to the ground.\\xa0 There were two such markings there.\\xa0 \\u201cIs the fox.\\xa0 That\\u2019s not one you used to see very often, and you\\u2019d never see it in pairs.\\xa0 Usually people would work together, deal with it, and the only fox mark you\\u2019d see would be crossed out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere was one earlier, too,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBy the waypoint.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the fox?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe fox preys on the mouse,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian\\u2019s eyes widened.</p>\\n<p>The rain was worse here, kind of.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t that it was technically heavier rain or anything, but the buildings didn\\u2019t necessarily have gutters, the water streamed off of the rooftops, and it spattered as it landed in puddles, where the water hadn\\u2019t drained completely.</p>\\n<p>The houses were dilapidated, falling to pieces, many uninhabitable.\\xa0 Even the poor had started migrating toward the city center, leaving the edges a little lonelier.</p>\\n<p>Jamie pointed, indicating another fox scratched into a doorframe.\\xa0 I nodded.</p>\\n<p>We came to a stop.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey!\\u201d Gordon shouted.\\xa0 \\u201cButtholes!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a pause.</p>\\n<p>A window opened, on the second floor of a building across the street.\\xa0 A boy about our age poked his head out.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat, dickstink?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow about a hello, huh?\\xa0 Open the door,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The kid smirked, then pulled his head back inside.\\xa0 I heard him give an order to another kid.\\xa0 A few seconds later, the door opened.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is meant as a bit of a treat to you, Mary,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She arched an eyebrow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShow you a bit of what Gordon and I used to do, back in the day,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like that,\\u201d she said, smiling.\\xa0 She folded up her umbrella.</p>\\n<p>We passed into the house.\\xa0 There were three kids on the ground floor, and an older, shirtless boy at the top of the stairs.\\xa0 I recognized Thom, and the young Daisy.\\xa0 The house was scattered with knick-knacks and detritus.\\xa0 I was being polite, given that it was ninety percent trash.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd,\\u201d I added, under my breath, \\u201cI thought you might like to get some tips on lockpicking, among other things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her eyes lit up.\\xa0 She gave me a happy little wiggle of the shoulders.</p>\\n<p>We made our way up the stairs, to a floor of the house that had little more than scattered bedding without beds, blankets, and discarded clothes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLong time, Gordon,\\u201d the shirtless boy said.\\xa0 \\u201cHi Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen gave him a wave.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCraig,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He threw an arm around Craig\\u2019s shoulders in a half-hug, Craig doing the same.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi,\\u201d Lillian said, as the blonde girl Daisy approached.\\xa0 She was seven or eight, if I had to guess.\\xa0 Not that anyone had ever known or cared about Daisy\\u2019s birthday, to keep track.</p>\\n<p>Daisy ignored Lillian, talking to me instead.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been keeping an ear out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can tell you who\\u2019s who, now, and what happened with the Byron Boys, and how Miss E is sleeping with the pastor\\u2019s sister,\\u201d Daisy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou gotta ask for cash before you drop tidbits like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSetting the hook,\\u201d Daisy said, looking up at me.\\xa0 \\u201cLike you told me.\\xa0 There\\u2019s enough more that I\\u2019m not worried.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright, fair.\\xa0 Hook\\u2019s set,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cCuriosity piqued.\\xa0 But give me a bit to get caught up before I start grilling you.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want to pay for information I can pick up for free.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She made a face.</p>\\n<p>There were several more kids on the upper floor \\u2013 six in all.\\xa0 A card game was underway.\\xa0 Most were just staying in the darker corners, enduring the heat.\\xa0 Many heads turned as Helen came up the stairs.</p>\\n<p>Thom came up the stairs behind us.\\xa0 I clapped a hand on his shoulder as he passed me.\\xa0 He\\u2019d helped me get my hands on the others\\u2019 files, back around the time we\\u2019d dealt with the snake charmer.\\xa0 He\\u2019d helped me many other times, besides.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomeone\\u2019s going to break out the old practice locks for this pretty girl to learn lockpicking,\\u201d I said, indicating Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd they\\u2019re going to do it for free.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat so?\\u201d a boy I didn\\u2019t know asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019ll show you a cool knife trick,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAfter she\\u2019s learned something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He mulled it over for a second, then waved her over, lifting up the bench under the window to pull out some stuff.</p>\\n<p>The rest found their places, Helen watching the card game, distracting both of the players.\\xa0 Lillian stuck closer to me, while Jamie found a seat, pulling out the book we\\u2019d interrupted him from reading earlier.</p>\\n<p>I started to fill Lillian in on particulars.\\xa0 Rules, expectations, groups, with Daisy nodding along and enjoying being able to offer her own input, while being very miffed at Lillian being there at the same time.</p>\\n<p>I was distracted from my explanation as I overheard Gordon talking with Craig in a low voice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGirl troubles,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know those troubles,\\u201d Craig said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon smiled.\\xa0 He looked more at ease than I\\u2019d seen him in a while.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve got other troubles?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p><em>Of course he\\u2019d find other work to do.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not like we get a proper day off.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cLots,\\u201d Craig said.\\xa0 \\u201cBe more specific.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLast I was aware, you had a lot more kids up here, that was half a year ago.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d Craig said.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not because of the waypoints or anything, is it?\\xa0 Kids being unable to get from there to here, because of curfews and checkpoints and all that?\\xa0 There\\u2019s something else going on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie was looking up from his book, watching.\\xa0 Most of the others were distracted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI saw four foxes scratched into the scenery on the way here,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cKids in here, not out and about?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Craig nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho\\u2019re you hiding from?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Craig made a face.</p>\\n<p>There were more ears listening, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cOut with it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s awkward, given you are who you are,\\u201d Craig said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t know if I should.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t want to hurt our ongoing relationship.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon punched Craig, hard, in the arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTry again,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Craig frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Academy.\\xa0 Pretty sure it\\u2019s the Academy.\\xa0 Picking off the little ones.\\xa0 They go, they don\\u2019t come back, they don\\u2019t turn

sense.\\xa0 Whatever you need.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He offered me a smile.</p>\\n<p>We were spread out, walking as a pack, some more off to one side than the others.\\xa0 Our core was Lillian and Jamie, however, with both me and Mary close by.\\xa0 Helen was off to one side, swishing her skirt with her hands periodically, walking backward now and again, in her own little world.\\xa0 Gordon was leading the way, looking alert and wary enough that it was liable to tip off anyone who saw, if they were even watching.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t so sure they were.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGhosts,\\u201d Mary commented, in a way that suggested she was thinking aloud.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, someone else named our enemies for us, this time around,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mary continued, \\u201cOnes that will throw one child off a building to claim another.\\xa0 They\\u2019re elusive, they show up in a black carriage and never where the mice can approach or deal with them.\\xa0 They disappear, and their victims disappear with them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been at the Academy for two weeks, waiting for your appointments,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI haven\\u2019t seen any captured children around, have any of you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIn twos and threes, sure.\\xa0 Families?\\xa0 Sure.\\xa0 But nothing like they described.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf Jamie says no, that\\u2019s pretty definitive,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 His voice was low, and he sounded almost distant.\\xa0 Preoccupied.\\xa0 He added only a belated, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCould be going straight to the dungeons,\\u201d I remarked.\\xa0 \\u201cUnless, have you been down there, Helen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes!\\xa0 My father is doing some projects for the war.\\xa0 I was observing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan you not call him that?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s icky.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Helen said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cI didn\\u2019t see any children.\\xa0 But they\\u2019re still renovating, and I didn\\u2019t have permission to go to the lower floors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoing nothing to work against the \\u2018ghost\\u2019 idea,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019ve up and disappeared.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I took note of more marks here and there.\\xa0 Symbols on doorframes of homes and small shops \\u2013 the sort of small, crummy little bakery that subsisted in the shims, and homes that barely qualified as homes.\\xa0 A roof over the head and something on the floor to sleep in.\\xa0 Many, going by the aroma, didn\\u2019t have proper washrooms.\\xa0 The people we saw here and there, far too sparse considering the time of day and the area, all dirty.\\xa0 Most didn\\u2019t seem to care or give a second thought about the rain.</p>\\n<p>It was the heat that did it.\\xa0 Putting up a hood was unpleasant, more fabric meant more heat.\\xa0 Raising an umbrella was too much effort.</p>\\n<p>Better to get soaked, and let the faint breezes be that much more effective.</p>\\n<p>None of us had raincoats, and only Jamie had an umbrella.\\xa0 Jamie and Lillian had bags, but both were carrying very little \\u2013 Jamie\\u2019s oversized notebook, and Lillian\\u2019s bare essentials for care.</p>\\n<p>My eye fell on Jamie\\u2019s book.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid you get descriptions?\\xa0 For the women?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did.\\xa0 Three women have been seen, as far as we can tell.\\xa0 Each in good shape, attractive, each wearing makeup.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot always a priority for a doctor or a student,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He was thinking of Shipman, no doubt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cEspecially for a group that\\u2019s been trawling the shims.\\xa0 You\\u2019d think makeup would make them stand out more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you have a thought?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot really.\\xa0 Keep going.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t stampede all over you.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll think on it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He smiled, \\u201cI\\u2019m used to being trampled over.\\xa0 Um.\\xa0 There\\u2019s the man, older, usually seen with the carriage, and then the three women.\\xa0 One of the women is a blonde, another is a redhead, the third is from the East.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEastern Crown States or over-the-pond East?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAcross the western pond,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cChinese, Japanese, or something like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t see many of those,\\u201d I remarked.\\xa0 \\u201cThey aren\\u2019t usually allowed, given we\\u2019re at war with them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought about it, and I don\\u2019t remember seeing anyone fitting that description around Radham,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs it possible they\\u2019re not actual Academy personnel, but an experiment?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s just the impression I get.\\xa0 One man, at arm\\u2019s length from the rest, sending his creations out to do the dirty work,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd sometimes men like making pretty women when they\\u2019re making their servants.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo they?\\u201d Helen asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI had no idea.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShush, you\\u201d Mary said, but she smiled.\\xa0 Helen smiled back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat methodology, you\\u2019re thinking about Hayle?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cHow he uses <em>us</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t, actually,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a common pattern,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s in keeping with how the Academy works.\\xa0 Leadership figure at the center, operating through several arms, each of those branching out into subordinates and then branching out further to the work and creations those subordinates work with.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t rule out the Academies as the source of this problem,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cMuch as we might want to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Are you saying that because you really believe it, or because of what Craig said, about you being beholden to other interests?\\xa0 </em>I couldn\\u2019t help but wonder.\\xa0 Much as Gordon hadn\\u2019t done or said anything to suggest he was going to betray us or the Academy and run off to go find Fray, I wasn\\u2019t sure I trusted him entirely.\\xa0 More to do with what I didn\\u2019t fully grasp about his current psychology than about any actual decisions he was making.</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t see the moves he was making or thinking about making.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t anticipate him.\\xa0 That left me feeling very unsteady in the Gordon department.\\xa0 His break with Shipman was perhaps the best move he could\\u2019ve made, and went a long way toward restoring my confidence in him.</p>\\n<p>But even here, with Craig, I couldn\\u2019t be sure.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s action, dragging me into the room under the stairs, it had surprised me, but when I looked at it in perspective, it felt natural and flowed with my understanding of her.\\xa0 Some of Gordon\\u2019s most mundane, everyday actions or word choices didn\\u2019t feel natural or flow with my understanding of him, odd as it was to think about.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf what we know about the ghosts holds up, they won\\u2019t show up where we can get at them and outnumber them,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe should do what the mice did.\\xa0 Find perches and observe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cIf that doesn\\u2019t work, we could lay a trap, or we could try baiting them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrap in what sense?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLiteral trap.\\xa0 Deadfall, dig a hole in the ground for the carriage to fall into?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat sounds like a pain in the ass,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll have Craig\\u2019s gang do the heavy lifting,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He rolled his eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you really think baiting them is a better idea?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cAgainst a complete unknown?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, I suppose not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGroups of three?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWe know from hearing about what happened to Tom and Sam that they\\u2019ll go after pairs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He gave me a nod.\\xa0 \\u201cGroups of three.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou pick first,\\u201d I offered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I frowned at him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Assuming each group needs to keep one person who can handle themselves in a fight, that forces my hand.</em></p>\\n<p>Had he given me Mary on purpose?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d I finally said.\\xa0 I eyed her, but her face didn\\u2019t give anything away.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a curt nod by way of response.\\xa0 He turned and pointed at a nearby rooftop.\\xa0 The four posts at the corner were grown wood, not cut, and the branches reached up.\\xa0 A tattered cloth fluttered there, bound at all four corners.\\xa0 There would be shade, cover from the rain, and a little bit of concealment.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie, Mary, any preference?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She pointed at a small church.\\xa0 The window was broken and hadn\\u2019t been repaired, suggesting it was abandoned.\\xa0 Stone walls.\\xa0 It would be cooler, better insulated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSounds good,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Then he was gone.</p>\\n<p>A little abrupt.\\xa0 Too businesslike.</p>\\n<p>He was someone I could no longer pin down.</p>\\n<p>We made our way to the church, noting the markings here and there.</p>\\n<p>On a door, a circle, with three pairs of the \\u2018closed eyes\\u2019 that marked death.\\xa0 Again, it was old.\\xa0 Simply a sign of life in the shims.\\xa0 More for remembrance than anything else, though there were areas marked with innumerable \\u2018closed eyes\\u2019 that were essentially back alley battlefields.\\xa0 I saw the three crossed lines that formed a six point star, warning of Academy lawmen, and a series of diamonds around a \\u2018t\\u2019 shape, which warned of a monster.\\xa0 An escaped experiment, very likely.</p>\\n<p>We reached the church and found it empty.\\xa0 Dust was thick in the air, the light catching it, and plant life had grown up through floorboards, climbing up the walls.\\xa0 It was strange to see a church which had Academy materials, but I saw the less-straight, organic patterns, framing some of the windows, reinforcing some of the cracked stone.\\xa0 From older days, before the Crown had started taking issue with the cross.\\xa0 It came down to power, as so many things did.</p>\\n<p>Once-white sheets stained with leaked, fatty tissues and bodily fluids were laid out on pews, of varying ages.\\xa0 The bodies they covered were emaciated, mummified by the changes in temperature and the elements that had made their way in through broken windows and cracked walls.\\xa0 In lieu of burial, people had been laid to rest here for the scavengers to gnaw on and the weeds and moss to embrace.</p>\\n<p>Jamie changed course slightly to fix a cloth, gently lifting up a skeletal head to tuck the corner of the sheet beneath, so it was covered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey weren\\u2019t buried?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is easier,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cPeople do what\\u2019s easiest, as a rule.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think it\\u2019s more about wanting to put the dead to rest where graverobbers won\\u2019t find them and haul them off for a few coins,\\u201d Jamie said, briefly laying a hand to rest on the sheet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr both,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr both,\\u201d he echoed me.</p>\\n<p>He wiped his hands on his shorts as he rejoined us.</p>\\n<p>We ascended stone stairs up to the second floor, and I took a little bit more care with the footing, before deciding the floor was secure.\\xa0 The floorboards were loose, broad, thick planks with old fashioned square nails at the ends, but the wood was sturdy.\\xa0 I perched in one window at the north face, my back to the frame, feet on the windowsill, so I had a view of both the interior and the world outside.</p>\\n<p>Mary took her time setting up a tripline at the top of the stairs.\\xa0 Once she was done, she sat in much the same position I was, at another window at the west face of the church.\\xa0 We had a view of each other, but she was so far away I\\u2019d have to raise my voice to talk to her.</p>\\n<p>I wondered if that was residual awkwardness from her talk.\\xa0 It said a lot that the moment she\\u2019d sat down, she had a knife out, turning it over and around in her hands, periodically tossing it into the air and catching it by the handle.</p>\\n<p>Antsy Mary.</p>\\n<p>Jamie stood by my window, backpack off and dropping to the floor beside me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSee them?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>Under the distant rooftop, Gordon\\u2019s group was already waiting and watching.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWill the pen scratchings bother you?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 My eyes roved over the street.\\xa0 There was a group of stitched standing in an alley by a building.\\xa0 I wondered if they were expired or waiting for nighttime.\\xa0 On a hot day like today, the usual faint burned-hair, rotting-flesh smell of a stitched could become a pungent burned-hair, rotting-flesh smell, instead.\\xa0 It was humid enough that the air carried smells far better than it usually might.</p>\\n<p>I could remember how Mary smelled, in close proximity to me.\\xa0 Memory and sense of smell weren\\u2019t my strongest traits, yet it stuck with me.</p>\\n<p>A bit of a tangent of a thought, that.</p>\\n<p>Jamie settled down beneath me, his head resting against the windowsill, back to the wall.\\xa0 He had his book out, and was scratching away, drawing a map.</p>\\n<p>Something big lurked in darker corners between a wall and a building.\\xa0 A bear without fur, a reptile without scale, it was hard to tell from a distance.\\xa0 I watched it until it moved out into the street.\\xa0 I saw locals look at it without reacting with alarm, and took it to be a long-time resident of the shims.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you and Mary okay?\\u201d Jamie asked, voice soft.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re fine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause the way you\\u2019re sitting and not talking, it makes me think you\\u2019re not quite okay,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll adjust.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not worried,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe might want some time to think on her own.\\xa0 You know as well as anyone how hard it can be to think straight when you\\u2019re surrounded by the rest of the Lambs.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 His pen scratched away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t a convincing uh huh, Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t a convincing statement, Sy,\\u201d he retorted, not looking up from the page.</p>\\n<p>I frowned down at the top of his head, but his nose was in his book, and he couldn\\u2019t see.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary!\\u201d I called out, making Jamie jump, \\u201cHey!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She turned her head slowly, reluctantly, and gave me an annoyed look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re okay, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She switched her knife to her other hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>She threw it.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t flinch as it sank into the wood about a foot above my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what that means!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re fine, Sy!\\u201d she said, in a tone that suggested the opposite.\\xa0 \\u201cNow shush!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Silence reigned, but for Jamie\\u2019s pen scratches and the periodic noise from outside.</p>\\n<p>I reached up and tried to pull the knife from the windowframe.\\xa0 When I couldn\\u2019t, Jamie sighed, exasperated, and rose from his seat to reach over and haul it free.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was the angle,\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I couldn\\u2019t get it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was.\\xa0 And if I pulled too hard, I\\u2019d fall, and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019d never do something that nice for others without an ulterior motive,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I stuck my tongue out at him.\\xa0 He did the same to me, before half-sitting, half-collapsing to the floor at the base of the window.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou weren\\u2019t supposed to mention it, I think,\\u201d Jamie mused.\\xa0 \\u201cThat there was anything with you and Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou asked.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever exactly happened, it was between you two, maybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you asked,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd a gentleman never tells,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd there\\u2019s nothing to tell.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie looked up, face turned up so he looked at me upside-down.\\xa0 He raised an eyebrow, then relaxed it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd besides, who would ever call me a gentleman?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoint.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I watched a few carriages move through the shims.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t look like an Academy make, and there was nothing particularly special about them to draw my attention.</p>\\n<p>That would be suspicious unto itself, if we didn\\u2019t have the details we did.</p>\\n<p>A light flashed in my eye.</p>\\n<p>I looked and saw Mary, angling a blade to reflect light at my eye.</p>\\n<p>That would get annoying fast.</p>\\n<p>Before I could do anything, she raised the blade to her lips, shushing me, and then pointed with her free hand.</p>\\n<p>There was a rat, crawling across the rooftop.\\xa0 Unlike the usual rat, it was green.\\xa0 Fur tufted out and back, winding around the tail.\\xa0 Flowers and weeds were growing out of it, all apparently alive.</p>\\n<p>A perfect camouflage.</p>\\n<p>By the angle of Jamie\\u2019s head, he was already watching it as it found a hole in the floor and squeezed its way through, a small puff of plant matter flying out as it made its way free.</p>\\n<p>When I looked back at Mary, she was smiling.\\xa0 She shifted position, looking outside once more, expression still soft.</p>\\n<p>She looked lonely, I thought.\\xa0 That was a thing.</p>\\n<p>But I was pretty sure we were okay.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s nice, stepping away from the city sometimes,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re in the city.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, from the city-city.\\xa0 The machinery and meat of it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what this is, if not the meat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe bones, the framework, the husk?\\u201d Jamie suggested.\\xa0 \\u201cThe dead leaves, fallen from a living tree?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDark way of looking at it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think so?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think you\\u2019re weird,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you\\u2019re not?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re being all poetic and garbage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Garbage?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTalking about this place and making it out into something it isn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He leaned his head back, so it rested against the edge of my thigh and the windowsill.\\xa0 \\u201cI spend so much time in the past.\\xa0 Wallowing in memory.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like to think about the future.\\xa0 Extrapolate.\\xa0 Figure out where we\\u2019re going.\\xa0 And the shims feel like a place we\\u2019re going.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow\\u2019s that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat rat.\\xa0 A project long forgotten.\\xa0 How long before the world\\u2019s riddled with things like that?\\xa0 The wars are done, maybe we\\u2019re here, maybe we\\u2019re not, maybe not in the same way, and all over, there are experiments that have become matter of fact, their creators long forgotten.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAre we among those experiments?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He made a sound.\\xa0 A one-note huff of a suppressed laugh.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably not, huh?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I thought of Mary, and of Gordon, and of Mary and Gordon.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t really plotting what I was saying, but the words came out anyway, thoughts spilling out as words, more aimless than my usual.\\xa0 \\u201cProblem with looking too much at the future, is you can get caught up in enjoying or anticipating what\\u2019s down the road.\\xa0 Sometimes you have to live in the now, bring that future to pass.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wondered if Mary would.\\xa0 If she\\u2019d reach out to Gordon in time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s very, very good advice,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He seemed to take a while to digest it, then said, \\u201cI\\u2019d ask you if that\\u2019s what you talked to Mary about, but I think it should stay between you two.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDefinitely.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Several minutes passed.\\xa0 I watched another carriage carefully.\\xa0 Black, this time, but not an Academy carriage.\\xa0 It could be mistaken for one, if I wasn\\u2019t being generous to Craig\\u2019s group, but was it really the ghost carriage?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Mary called out.</p>\\n<p>Was she thinking the same thing?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon\\u2019s trying to get our attention.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked.</p>\\n<p>Mary was on the roof, arms extended above her head.\\xa0 She was distant, but she apparently noticed when I turned my head to face her.\\xa0 She extended an arm out toward the east.\\xa0 Gordon did the same.</p>\\n<p>I looked, searching, and in roughly twenty seconds, I saw the <em>real</em> ghost carriage come down the path.\\xa0 An Academy vehicle, washed free of dust by the rain, with nothing to suggest it was in any state of disrepair, a matching set of horses, covered by drapes to protect them from rain.\\xa0 Stitched.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere we are,\\u201d I observed.</p>\\n<p>Jamie stood to go look.\\xa0 He handed me his book, where he\\u2019d scratched out a map.\\xa0 He touched that map with one finger, moving it as the carriage traveled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought we\\u2019d have to spend a while waiting,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe hunt a grass-rat for food?\\xa0 What the hell are they doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t know,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>The carriage slowed, then stopped.</p>\\n<p>Two women got out, wearing labcoats with hoods.\\xa0 One had long, very straight hair, the Easterner, the other had red hair, curvier than the first.\\xa0 They started walking, a very leisurely, sure pace.\\xa0 Moving as if they knew where they were going.</p>\\n<p>Curious.</p>\\n<p>The carriage resumed motion, turning at the next corner.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe carriage always picks them up,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cRight?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it dropped them off, it\\u2019s moving, it\\u2019s going to meet up with them again.\\xa0 Whatever they\\u2019re doing, they don\\u2019t expect to take long.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked over at Gordon.\\xa0 I pointed an arm straight out in his direction, then raised my arms above my head, an \\u2018x\\u2019 shape.</p>\\n<p>His group.\\xa0 Aggression.\\xa0 In the simplest terms possible, for our crude language system, he was going after the people.</p>\\n<p>His right arm went up, confirmation.</p>\\n<p>I left one arm above my head, then dropped it, letting it swing pendulum style.</p>\\n<p>My group.\\xa0 Ground, moving.</p>\\n<p>He raised his arm again, confirming.</p>\\n<p>We had our tasks.</p>\\n<p>Mary had joined Jamie and I.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d hoped to have her in Gordon\\u2019s group, to give her opportunity.\\xa0 Gordon had been oblivious.\\xa0 I was very aware of her, and thoughts of her as she\\u2019d been in that room danced through my head, making even the fact that she was standing near me that much more interesting and exciting.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re after the coach, he\\u2019s after the two on foot,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to stay together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to slow you guys down,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, you\\u2019re not staying behind,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cNot with that story Craig told about that one kid disappearing when they were searching for the first one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLen,\\u201d Jamie supplied.\\xa0 \\u201cBert.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGet your book,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cSy, help me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned, \\u201cWith?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She stomped on the floor.\\xa0 A floorboard rattled.</p>\\n<p>By the time Jamie had his book in his backpack, which wasn\\u2019t long at all, Mary and I had torn up a lone floorboard.\\xa0 It stretched twelve or so feet, and was less than a foot thick.\\xa0 We slid it out the window, to the nearest building.\\xa0 Mary tested it, wobbling it.</p>\\n<p>Jamie looked a little wary at that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll hold it,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cSy, you go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stepped up to the windowsill.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll take the bag,\\u201d I said, reaching for Jamie\\u2019s book.\\xa0 \\u201cI weigh less, and I trust my balance more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He handed me the bag, but his expression was clouded with doubt.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy do it like this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we go down, on foot and try to navigate around buildings, we\\u2019ll lose too much time,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Her reasoning continued as I ran down the length of the plank.\\xa0 I hooked the bag over a chimney and held the other end firm.</p>\\n<p>I could only barely hear what Mary was saying to Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201c-follow Sy and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He moved at a crouch, more a shuffle than a run, but it wasn\\u2019t as slow as I\\u2019d anticipated.\\xa0 Mary was as fast as I was.</p>\\n<p>As a pair, while Jamie held onto us to keep us from sliding down the shallow slope of the roof, we hauled the plank up, propping it up to the next building.\\xa0 We had to place it at an incline, leading up to a higher vantage point.\\xa0 One slip, we\\u2019d fall, bounce off the roof, and hit the road.</p>\\n<p>We flipped it dry side up before I went.\\xa0 I went up first, bare feet on wood, quick, and grabbed the edge of the roof.\\xa0 I hauled myself over the lip.\\xa0 Flat-topped roof.</p>\\n<p>I looked and noted the location of the carriage.\\xa0 Another look marked the location of the two women.\\xa0 Gordon, Lillian, and Helen were traveling over rooftops, too.</p>\\n<p>There were benefits to the dense urban geography and the narrow roads of the shims.</p>\\n<p>I gave Jamie a hand as he followed.\\xa0 The two of us reached down, each devoting one hand to holding the plank steady while the other hand reached for her hands.\\xa0 We clasped her fingers and lifted her up.</p>\\n<p>From then on, it was smoother sailing.\\xa0 Buildings with grown exteriors, branches extending out, some hewn short, others left like leafless trees.\\xa0 Handholds.\\xa0 We tracked the cart.</p>\\n<p>There was a trick at work here.\\xa0 An experiment, something less natural.\\xa0 Academy work.</p>\\n<p>We hadn\\u2019t done anything at this point that Craig\\u2019s mice couldn\\u2019t do.</p>\\n<p>Yet we made our way along rooftops, taking shortcuts, tracking the carriage.\\xa0 We kept the location of the women in mind, noting their presence every time intervening buildings blocked our view, giving Gordon\\u2019s group direction to point the way to the women when we could.</p>\\n<p>The carriage, apparently no longer intent on a rendezvous with the women, pulled away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCheckpoint,\\u201d Jamie huffed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat way would be one of the checkpoints.\\xa0 Search and investigation by Academy tools, armed guards.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re going back empty handed?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMust be,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe carriage only stopped once.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo carriages?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>I frowned.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t see a second.</p>\\n<p>Gordon had stopped, he was signaling.</p>\\n<p>A question.</p>\\n<p>I turned and looked, tracking the last known location of the women.</p>\\n<p>One woman.\\xa0 The Eastern one.\\xa0 Between the time they\\u2019d stepped behind an obstacle and now, one of the two had become a ghost.</p>\\n<p>Mary was drawing a weapon.</p>\\n<p>I drew the blade she\\u2019d thrown at me.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s group seemed to get the message.\\xa0 Gordon hopped down from the rooftop, out of view, Helen and Lillian following, in that order.</p>\\n<p>The problem with hunting predators, was that the tables could so easily turn.</p>\\n<p>We moved, running along wet, loose shingles, weapons in hand.</p>\\n<p><a

resistance.\\xa0 Daisy stiffened.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I haven\\u2019t had you in on previous leadership meetings, I don\\u2019t want you in on this one,\\u201d Craig said.\\xa0

Craig warned.</p>\\n<p>An unsteady sort of leadership here.\\xa0 One enforced with knocks on the head and crude threats.\\xa0 But it was necessary.\\xa0 Anything else wouldn\\u2019t work on kids like these, who didn\\u2019t know other sorts of authority, and the alternative was having no leadership at all.</p>\\n<p>Thom remained, as did the boy with the locks, who was sitting with Mary, and one other.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe called them ghosts, at first.\\xa0 We lost two of the youngest ones, one right after the other,\\u201d Craig explained.\\xa0 \\u201cSent Bertie home.\\xa0 He\\u2019d been here too long, taking too much, not giving.\\xa0 Figured his dad would give him a hard time and he could come back later.\\xa0 But he wasn\\u2019t to stay here all the time.\\xa0 He cried, but he went.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd he never made it?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Craig made a face.\\xa0 Disgusted.\\xa0 \\u201cI should\\u2019ve had him stay.\\xa0 My gut told me it wasn\\u2019t right, sending him back, but I wasn\\u2019t thinking about it in terms of the bigger picture, y\\u2019know?\\xa0 I thought it was about him and his dad and his dad roughed him up but he\\u2019d <em>survive</em>.\\xa0 Weighed his survival against ours and what he was costing us by eating out of our cupboards.\\xa0 Thinking too small, not considering everything else.\\xa0 <em>Stupid</em>!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know deep down inside that there was no predicting something like this.\\xa0 You couldn\\u2019t have known.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI <em>knew!\\xa0 </em>Not about the ghosts or foxes or Academy.\\xa0 I knew he was little and he hadn\\u2019t got that thick skin we all get at some point.\\xa0 He ducked his head and he cried and anyone who looked at him knew he was a victim.\\xa0 Whoever took him knew he was a victim!\\xa0 He was prey to the whole rest of the world and I knew it and I sent him out there alone!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThen yeah.\\xa0 It was your fault, at least a little.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Craig shook his head, but it was in anger at himself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were angry with him,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou wanted to give him that thicker skin, you knew you couldn\\u2019t coddle him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t justify it,\\u201d Craig said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow far to his

minutes away?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Craig nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said there was another.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019ve been six I know of,\\u201d Craig said.\\xa0 \\u201cTwo right from under my nose.\\xa0 Bert was the first.\\xa0 We went out looking for him.\\xa0 I expected to find his body.\\xa0 Nothing.\\xa0 But while we were looking, we got a little too far apart from each other.\\xa0 Len was helping out, never one to stay here overnight, had it pretty good, but he\\u2019d play cards with us, join in any games, participate if we were pulling something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSharp enough a guy.\\xa0 Whisked away, not five seconds after I last saw him.\\xa0 No noise, no scuffle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLen\\u2019s mom is torn up about it,\\u201d Thom said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you?\\u201d Gordon asked Craig.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLen could look after himself,\\u201d Craig said, but his expression betrayed some concern or doubt.\\xa0 Self-blame, but it didn\\u2019t cut as deep as Bert did.\\xa0 Craig cleared his throat.\\xa0 \\u201cWe switched it around, so we didn\\u2019t go anywhere except in groups.\\xa0 When they were in the mood to play with cards or dice, I told them to do it from perches.\\xa0 Watch over the streets while they played.\\xa0 Keep an eye out for anything odd.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat we saw was people in Academy coats, using Academy carriages.\\xa0 People with gray coats, loading an unconscious kid into the coach.\\xa0 Since we started keeping an eye out, we\\u2019ve seen the carriages show up now and again.\\xa0 Usually from a distance.\\xa0 We try, we lay in wait, but they steer clear.\\xa0 Can\\u2019t seem to pin them down.\\xa0 But they\\u2019re still getting us.\\xa0 That\\u2019s when we started to call them ghosts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll boys?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Girls too,\\u201d Craig said.\\xa0 \\u201cTom and Sam were at one perch.\\xa0 Got caught up in their game, not watching, Tom says.\\xa0 Then hands seize him, they tip him off the edge of the roof.\\xa0 Broken arm, broken leg, wrenched his arm so bad it tore out of the socket.\\xa0 What are you supposed to do, knowing what we know, that it\\u2019s Academy people doing this, and Tom is that hurt?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There was a waver of emotion in Craig\\u2019s voice.\\xa0 He was younger than some of the leaders of the mice I\\u2019d seen.\\xa0 Experienced, but young.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t have full control over his emotions, he wasn\\u2019t detached, and his skin was thinner than he\\u2019d like to pretend.\\xa0 When he asked what he was supposed to do, the uncertainty was spilling out.\\xa0 That uncertainty was laced with the raw fear of someone that was responsible for others and failing in their duties.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did you end up doing?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWith Tom?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSent him to the Hedge.\\xa0 His mom says he\\u2019s there, he\\u2019s in repair.\\xa0 He hasn\\u2019t disappeared.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think that was the right thing to do,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Craig shook his head a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd\\u2026 I forget the other one\\u2019s name?\\xa0 Who was on the roof with him?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSam.\\xa0 She was next oldest, compared to me.\\xa0 Tom didn\\u2019t even see them leave the building.\\xa0 Whoever attacked him, they and Sam just\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Craig spread his hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGone.\\xa0 A ghost,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was a lot easier when she was around,\\u201d Craig said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think I remember her.\\xa0 Scowler, wasn\\u2019t she?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFace like a dog with its muzzle smashed in,\\u201d Craig said.\\xa0 He glanced at Lillian, \\u201cDon\\u2019t give me that look.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t- okay, I was, but you can\\u2019t say that about a <em>girl.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe said worse about herself.\\xa0 She knew where her strengths were, and none of the whole sitting proper, doing up her hair nice, wearing powder on her face and being sweet stuff was part of it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian shifted uncomfortably.\\xa0 Her hands had been folded in her lap, and she, very casually, shifted her posture, so they were gripping the bench on either side of her legs, instead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFeel like I have to ask, so I don\\u2019t step on toes,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou want help with this one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think I have any other choice,\\u201d Craig said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 He glanced at me, and I nodded confirmation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you have descriptions?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTom does, but he\\u2019s at the Hedge.\\xa0 Daisy was one of the ones who kept a lookout.\\xa0 She\\u2019s seen \\u2019em from a distance.\\xa0 You could ask her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded, rising from his seat, bringing notebook and pen with as he headed downstairs.</p>\\n<p>Gordon heaved out a sigh.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t miss the fact that one hand was clenched in a weird way.\\xa0 Another attack, so soon?</p>\\n<p>Still, he spoke in a very careful, level voice.\\xa0 \\u201cI know you know something about what we do.\\xa0 That we do work for the Academy.\\xa0 I know you know well enough not to ask.\\xa0 Because we\\u2019re not telling you particulars.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Craig nodded, jaw set in a firm line.</p>\\n<p>This had been a point of contention in the past.\\xa0 The not-telling part.\\xa0 In a world where the stars had aligned differently, the pair could have been the best of friends.\\xa0 In this world, the secrecy had been a wedge.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKnowing what I know about the Academy, I\\u2019ve got to say this, and I know the response you\\u2019re going to give, but I\\u2019ve got to say it.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know that there\\u2019s any guarantee the Academy did it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Craig\\u2019s posture shifted, forward-leaning, aggressive, \\u201cAcademy-controlled town in wartime, Gordon?\\xa0 Academy coats?\\xa0 Academy transportation?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s likely,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cBut it\\u2019s not a guarantee.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure, Gordon,\\u201d Craig said, in the most disagreeable way possible, without quite being sarcastic.\\xa0 His hands clenched the fabric of his shorts at his knees.\\xa0 \\u201cDecide what you want.\\xa0 You have to do what you have to do.\\xa0 But if anyone gets snatched up while you\\u2019re wasting time trying to prove the people you work for didn\\u2019t do it, you know I\\u2019m going to hold it against you, yeah?\\xa0 If they\\u2019re dead or disappeared?\\xa0 That\\u2019ll be on you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He suddenly looked very tired.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you need?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cClothes,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cClean-ish.\\xa0 We\\u2019re wearing orphanage clothes.\\xa0 We need orphan clothes, instead.\\xa0 So we don\\u2019t stand out if we happen to be looking around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have many girl clothes,\\u201d Craig said.\\xa0 \\u201cRoom under the stairs was where Sam changed when she came over.\\xa0 Might have something.\\xa0 Come on down, I\\u2019ll get some of my stuff so you can wear it.\\xa0 Might smell a bit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll live,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was in the kitchen with Daisy, grilling her while he sketched.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t making him pay for the information, which was a little out of sync with the lessons I\\u2019d taught her.\\xa0 I\\u2019d used her on a previous job, way back in the day, because she\\u2019d been small enough to go unnoticed.\\xa0 She\\u2019d proven good at listening to the drone of gossip here and there, picking out the important details from the noise, and I\\u2019d had her hone those talents.\\xa0 Whatever she wound up doing, and the shims weren\\u2019t a part of Radham that brimmed with opportunity, knowing what was going on and what information other people might be willing to pay for was a skill she could carry with her.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d worked with others that weren\\u2019t here now.\\xa0 I\\u2019d worked with Thom, but not in a specific capacity.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUnder the stairs?\\u201d Lillian clarified.\\xa0 The area in question was adjacent to the kitchen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 That\\u2019s the girl\\u2019s room,\\u201d Craig said, waving his hand to indicate the general direction.</p>\\n<p>I glanced over, and noted that the \\u2018girl\\u2019s room\\u2019 wasn\\u2019t a room so much as a closet, and that might have been generous.\\xa0 A pole had been nailed into the doorway to the space, and a curtain hung from it.\\xa0 Lillian and Helen entered, while Mary joined me in watching Jamie\\u2019s sketching.</p>\\n<p>He was doing it in very loose, broad sketches.\\xa0 General shape.\\xa0 Man in a lab coat, drawn in about five loose sweeps of the pen, basic geometric shapes.\\xa0 When Daisy said the man had been taller and narrower, the hair different, sweeping back, Jamie started anew, elsewhere on the page.\\xa0 Once that was set, he moved on to details.</p>\\n<p>He still wasn\\u2019t an artist, but there was a process at work.\\xa0 One that relied on his ability to recreate that which he\\u2019d done before, making steady adjustments.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI only saw him from far away,\\u201d Daisy said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s more or less it?\\xa0 My head plays tricks on me.\\xa0 I imagine him as more devilish than I know he was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMemory is a funny thing like that,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cTell me about the woman?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWomen,\\u201d Daisy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWomen,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I would have thought that women would get the attention of the other boys in the house, but they were clustered in the kitchen, talking nonchalantly.\\xa0 It made me think that something was up.\\xa0 I watched them, trying to figure out what they were doing, until Gordon interrupted, hucking balled-up clothes at me.\\xa0 I took the first, heaviest ball right in the stomach, then caught the rest out of the air.</p>\\n<p>I took a step to the right, so some of the boys in the kitchen blocked Mary\\u2019s view of me, unclipped my suspenders, and switched shorts in roughly two seconds flat.\\xa0 I pulled off my shirt, stepping back into view.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like how you stepped out of view of me, but you didn\\u2019t for Daisy,\\u201d Mary observed.\\xa0 \\u201cI see how things are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you?\\u201d I asked, smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat I see,\\u201d Gordon commented, \\u201cIs the skinniest little bastard.\\xa0 Half of the people in this house don\\u2019t even eat regularly, and they\\u2019ve got more meat on their bones than you do, Sly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I offered him an obscene gesture, pulling on the dark gray sleeveless shirt.\\xa0 In a proper outfit, it would have been an undershirt at best.\\xa0 For the here and now, it worked for casual wear in the poorer end of town.\\xa0 Shorts, shirt, no shoes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 But he threw -not tossed but <em>threw</em>\\u2013 the clothes at me instead.\\xa0 I caught them, took them over to Jamie, and draped them over his back, as he hunched over his book.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll change when the girls are through,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShy?\\u201d Craig asked, tone just a little mean and mocking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Jamie said, softly.\\xa0 \\u201cShy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon might\\u2019ve said or done something, because Craig replied, \\u201cFair.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen and Lillian emerged.\\xa0 Both were wearing bag dresses.\\xa0 Bottom of the barrel clothing, perhaps in even a literal sense.\\xa0 When parents were counting every bit of money that came their way, some used the bags that oats or crops came in to put clothes together.\\xa0 Some of the farmers had caught on, and had taken to printing the dresses in simple patterns.</p>\\n<p>Helen was, I suspected, going to stand out no matter what she did.\\xa0 She wore a slightly washed-out dress in a purple floral pattern, and was licking her hands and fingers, running them through her hair.\\xa0 Lillian\\u2019s dress was much the same, but checked in white and green, and considerably more washed out, and she wore her socks to the knee, while Helen\\u2019s feet were bare in her shoes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be right back,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy bag?\\u201d Lillian was asking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLeave it,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut if I need the stuff-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA full bag is the sort of thing that people are going to want to take.\\xa0 Leave it.\\xa0 Take only the essentials,\\u201d Gordon instructed.</p>\\n<p>The boys in the kitchen were acting different again.\\xa0 It dawned on me why.\\xa0 They were very casually leaning over, looking-\\xa0 I crossed the room, moving to their side, and saw that the curtain, due to the poorly-positioned and bent nails at one end of the rod, didn\\u2019t cover the entire gap.</p>\\n<p>I saw Mary in profile, undressing, felt a shock that was the opposite of unpleasant, momentarily paralyzing me.\\xa0 A knife\\u2019s blade dangling at her bare shoulder glinted, breaking the spell.</p>\\n<p>I felt annoyance and anger at the boys.\\xa0 Very casually, I crossed the room, leaned by the doorframe, and pulled the curtain shut.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was arguing about the bag with Gordon, and Helen was draped over the clothes that I\\u2019d draped over Jamie\\u2019s back, chin on his shoulders, watching him draw.</p>\\n<p>Sure that nobody would see and that heads wouldn\\u2019t roll, I met the eyes of the glaring boys and glared back, drawing my finger across my throat.</p>\\n<p>They found other places to be, scattering, some moving back upstairs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThanks for closing the curtain,\\u201d Mary murmured, through the curtain, her mouth not far from my ear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou could\\u2019ve moved, or done it yourself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThanks anyway,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 I could hear rustling.\\xa0 \\u201cYou looked.\\xa0 I saw.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh.\\xa0 Sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBoys will be curious,\\u201d she said, voice light and casual.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to know I\\u2019m worth being curious about.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHa ha,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI was curious about the knives, that\\u2019s all.\\xa0 You hide them so well.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s all?\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 Then come in, help me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 My brain missed a stair, thudding heavily at the next one down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh,\\u201d she said, echoing me, mocking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen and Lillian usually help you with that,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you need help at all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She poked her head out to my right, holding the curtain tight, looked around the room.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen and Lillian are busy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her hand gripped my collar.\\xa0 She hauled me into the little space, then hauled me a half-foot to one side, so my back was to the gap in the curtain.\\xa0 \\u201cThere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was in her underclothes, a camisole and knickers.\\xa0 She\\u2019d removed the ribbon from her hair, and it hung loose around her shoulders.\\xa0 The space was small enough I didn\\u2019t know where to look.</p>\\n<p>She turned her back to me, hands over her nearly-bare shoulders.\\xa0 \\u201cHere.\\xa0 Hold it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She held out wire.\\xa0 There were twists of metal at the ends.\\xa0 I took the wire from her, which was hard, given how fine it was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUp,\\u201d she said, holding the dress up in front of her.\\xa0 \\u201cDown a little.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I adjusted as she required.\\xa0 It was a necklace, of sorts, the pendant a throwing knife, pointing straight down toward her belly button.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan you connect the wires without moving it up or down?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>I did.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re better than Helen, and she\\u2019s done this a dozen times,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I was silent, watching as she pulled out more.\\xa0 There were ribbons and wires, straps and belts.\\xa0 I realized the band of her knickers was solid, more a belt than anything.\\xa0 I held her dress against her body as she judged the best possible length for the wires that connected to the belt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it had been just Helen in here, I don\\u2019t think you would\\u2019ve looked,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have that mortal fear of her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHealthy fear,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe finally talks!\\u201d she said.\\xa0 Mary sounded merry.\\xa0 She was damn well enjoying herself, putting me in this situation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd if it was just Lillian, you would\\u2019ve teased her.\\xa0 Said something or done something, to get a rise out of her.\\xa0 Then you would\\u2019ve protected her, holding the curtain closed like you did for me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s fun to tease.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe likes being teased,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She turned around, stepping closer, \\u201cLook over my shoulder.\\xa0 I want the ribbon to run along the same line the collar does.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I did.\\xa0 She had the ribbon held out, and I saw what she meant.\\xa0 A series of blades hung between her shoulderblades.\\xa0 I adjusted the slack.\\xa0 She held out another pair of ribbons, to draw out an \\u2018x\\u2019, pinning the blades in place.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLil likes being teased?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you tease her,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 Her breath was hot against my shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cBut me?\\xa0 You don\\u2019t dread me.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t tease me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou fall somewhere in the middle?\\u201d I said, making it a question.</p>\\n<p>She made a sound I couldn\\u2019t figure out.\\xa0 Something of a \\u2018phooey\\u2019 and a raspberry mixed together.\\xa0 She turned her back, picking through the knives and ribbons.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I had to put it into words, I respect you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere isn\\u2019t another one of the Lambs I\\u2019d rather avoid going up against, one-on-one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was silent.\\xa0 Then she slipped a ribbon through the armhole of the camisole, holding it diagonally against her back.\\xa0 She paused, and I took her signal to mean I should reach out and hold it in place.\\xa0 She turned her head, and I saw that she was smiling, eyes downcast.</p>\\n<p>She worked on tying the ribbon, then did another diagonally, the other way, with my help.\\xa0 She set the knives in place, then looped threads around the blades to keep them at the right angle.</p>\\n<p>Not a single sheath.\\xa0 Only blades, twenty-two by my count, close to skin.</p>\\n<p>She bent down, moving easily despite the close proximity to razor edges, skin brushing against the blades.\\xa0 She picked up one of Sam\\u2019s dresses.\\xa0 A washed out red, and pulled it on.\\xa0 I helped tug it into place, so the cheap fabric wouldn\\u2019t drag against any knifepoints.\\xa0 Without being asked, I did up the buttons at the back.\\xa0 Mary took the time to do up her hair in a loose, wild ponytail, wavy brown hair lasso\\u2019ed with a strip of lace torn from a dress that was already going to rags.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid it bother you?\\xa0 The knives, the blades against skin?\\xa0 Back when you started, I mean.\\xa0 Was it something you had to get used to?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 Mostly to fill the quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI always liked it,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>She had a knife in her hand, and she hadn\\u2019t had one a second ago.\\xa0 She reached out, and I didn\\u2019t flinch, as she ran it down the inside of my right arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d she said, voice very quiet, eyes on the blade, as she moved it ever slower.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on with Gordon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s my place to say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She adjusted the position of the knife, pricked me, made me jump.</p>\\n<p>When I met her eyes, they were very close.\\xa0 Her face was an inch from mine.\\xa0 She was taller than me.\\xa0 Her breath touched the bridge of my nose and eyelashes.\\xa0 She was angry, annoyed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s going to pieces,\\u201d she said, without a trace of that anger in her voice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow long?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p><em>How long?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt can vary.\\xa0 He might get lucky, they might figure something out-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWeeks?\\xa0 Months?\\xa0 Years?\\u201d\\xa0 She moved the knife away.\\xa0 She raised it to the ponytail at the back, working with two \\u2018s\\u2019 shaped bits of wire.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot years,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She nodded, lowering her hands, the knife left where she\\u2019d placed it, hidden in her ribbon-tamed mane of hair.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re looking for the courage to say something to him,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr if you\\u2019re wondering what kind of window of opportunity you have, I can\\u2019t say for sure, but sooner is better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She put her hands on my shoulders, pushing me away.\\xa0 The space was confined enough that my head hit one of the stairs that slashed up through one upper corner of the little box of a room.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you want to say you like him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you were mocking Gordon for being a doof,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>It was my turn to ask, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNevermind.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know you like him.\\xa0 He\\u2019s handsome, he\\u2019s fantastic, you go together like peas in a pod.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not saying you\\u2019re wrong,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m saying that at this particular moment in time, Sy?\\xa0 You\\u2019re a bigger doof than Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat is a <em>baldfaced lie</em>.\\xa0 I\\u2019m never a bigger doof than Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you think this was, here, Sy?\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cSeriously.\\xa0 I\\u2019m trying to figure out what\\u2019s going through your head.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My voice was soft.\\xa0 I had a hard time meeting her eyes.\\xa0 I swallowed hard.\\xa0 \\u201cI think it was you inviting me in, lowering your defenses, and being beautiful and girly in a way that was very \\u2018Mary\\u2019.\\xa0 It\\u2019s- I don\\u2019t want to be weird, but every time I see a pretty girl, or have a nice moment with a girl, I\\u2019ll compare it to this.\\xa0 And a lot of the time, I\\u2019ll be comparing those things to this and they\\u2019ll be worse off for it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She started to speak, then stopped.\\xa0 She frowned at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot to be said for you being you, and getting to see a side of you nobody else has.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s pretty neat, you know,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She sighed.\\xa0 \\u201cSee?\\xa0 That <em>wasn\\u2019t</em> a doof answer.\\xa0 I was prepared to yell at you, and now I\\u2019m not sure what to say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, you can start by not saying doof anymore.\\xa0 It\\u2019s annoying.\\xa0 You doof.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She poked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou didn\\u2019t answer the question,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She pricked me again, just the tip of a knife, making me jump and bang my head on the stair a second time.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOw,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cSomeone\\u2019s going to hear that and wonder.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnswer the question.\\xa0 Why did I bring you in here?\\u201d she grilled me, still holding the knife.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause you think you like me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She moved the knife to my throat, threatening.\\xa0 \\u201cI like you, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Only Mary would say as much with a knife to someone\\u2019s throat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou do.\\xa0 Some.\\xa0 And,\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhen we\\u2019re in danger, Gordon\\u2019s the one you turn to.\\xa0 Gordon\\u2019s the one you ask about, the one you leap to the defense of.\\xa0 He\\u2019s your first pick when we\\u2019re pairing off.\\xa0 He\\u2019s the one you show interest in.\\xa0 When Shipman was there, you stepped into the background more.\\xa0 When she left the picture, earlier today, well, you started wanting to show off to boys.\\xa0 Even if it meant giving some strange boys a thrill by allowing them a peek, knowing you probably wouldn\\u2019t see them again.\\xa0 Letting Sy in as you\\u2019re getting dressed, telling yourself you have confidence and that you\\u2019re pretty, which you are.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019re aware, but Gordon\\u2019s more important to you than I am.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said, intense, then again, less intense, \\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She shifted her grip on the knife, frowning.\\xa0 I saw her move a little in frustration, not sure where to go or what to do.\\xa0 I thought she\\u2019d storm out.</p>\\n<p>Instead, she held the knife to my throat again.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is supposed to be one of those times where you lie.\\xa0 You bend the rules and you play unfair and you keep your stupid mouth shut, and you and I fumble our way along and there\\u2019s more like more of this and it\\u2019s <em>good</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I could\\u2019ve, I would,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cReally.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou should\\u2019ve,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut we don\\u2019t have the luxury of time.\\xa0 The Lambs won\\u2019t be around forever, and within a couple of years, maybe a couple of months, or weeks, or days, or hours, there\\u2019ll be one less Lamb.\\xa0 Then one less, then one less,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I paused.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t like saying the words.\\xa0 \\u201cLike I said\\u2026 the sooner the better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her expression shifted.\\xa0 Just a bit.\\xa0 A little bit of fragility.</p>\\n<p>I wondered, for a moment, if the expiry dates had ever really sunk home for her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d I whispered.</p>\\n<p>Her head bowed, her forehead coming to rest against mine.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d I whispered, gain.\\xa0 I reached out to rub her upper arms, felt knives under fabric, and shifted to her shoulders instead.</p>\\n<p>She nodded, the movement of her head making mine move in turn.</p>\\n<p>She stayed like that for several more seconds, then straightened, stepping away, head turning as she rubbed at the corner of one eye.\\xa0 I watched as her expression changed.\\xa0 Neutral, safe.\\xa0 A poker face as good as any I\\u2019d seen on her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019ll excuse me,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re excused,\\u201d I said, smiling a bit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to catch these \\u2018ghosts\\u2019,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause I damn well want to stab something right now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Then she swept the curtain aside and stepped out into the kitchen.</p>\\n<p>There was jeering.\\xa0 I heard the \\u2018thock\\u2019 of a knife striking a surface, and most of the jeering stopped.</p>\\n<p>I drew in a deep breath, then stepped out of the little room.</p>\\n<p>More jeering.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t have a knife to fling at them.</p>\\n<p>Jamie approached, bundle of clothes in his arms.\\xa0 He paused to lean close as he reached me, to say, \\u201cYou\\u2019re blushing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAm not,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He stepped inside.\\xa0 I held the curtain closed as I had with Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re not.\\xa0 I wanted to get a dig in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToo frigging bad,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou okay?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>I cocked my head to one side.\\xa0 I mulled over the question for a bit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot sure,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll distract you with a good mystery,\\u2019 Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHow\\u2019s that?\\xa0 Foxhunt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I smiled.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/03/lamb-to-the-slaughter-6-10/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The Percy before us was a younger version.\\xa0 If I had to guess, features had developed differently.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t wear a lab coat, and his clothes were utilitarian \\u2013 a shirt with buttons, left half-unbuttoned, and slacks.\\xa0 He was barefoot.\\xa0 Beating the heat as best as he could manage.</p>\\n<p>Dog had positioned himself so his body was between the small children Gordon had rescued and the worst of the gore and death.\\xa0 Not that it mattered.\\xa0 They were unconscious, by the look of things.\\xa0 Helen had a spring in her step as she approached them.</p>\\n<p>She would do fine as a babysitter, watching over them in case they roused.\\xa0 It was good that she had something to do while we mulled this over.</p>\\n<p>As for myself, I walked up to Mary\\u2019s side, before dropping down to sit on my heels, bringing myself more to her level.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t touch or prod her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan he talk?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The remainder of the Lambs gathered in a half-circle around Percy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs he dangerous?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot really,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cDog had me watch him while breaking the vats, the Percy tried to fight me, I beat him.\\xa0 He tried to run, we broke his legs.\\xa0 Well, that was mostly Dog, but I got us started.\\xa0 The moment Dog turned his back, the Percy crawled for a weapon under the table, we broke one of his arms.\\xa0 I think he got the message.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan I approach?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI frisked him, I don\\u2019t see a problem,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t have many supplies,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut we can at least patch him up.\\xa0 We <em>were</em> supposed to have one captive, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She paused to roll her skirt up at the waist, until she could kneel on the bloodstained floor.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t matter.\\xa0 She was already a mess from dealing with Mary.\\xa0 Still, appearances had to be observed.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Mary, who wasn\\u2019t really moving.\\xa0 Her eyes were focused on something I couldn\\u2019t see, making little movements as if she was following thoughts more than the current goings-on.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow many of you are there?\\u201d I asked Percy.</p>\\n<p>He remained silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, I don\\u2019t think you\\u2019ll get very far.\\xa0 He\\u2019s a tough nut to crack,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He was still leaning against the wall, a bit to the Percy\\u2019s right, arms folded.\\xa0 \\u201cPain doesn\\u2019t hurt him.\\xa0 He doesn\\u2019t care that much about death and dying.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo self-preservation?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot enough to matter,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe lives for the mission.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I rose from my crouching position, and began to explore the surroundings.\\xa0 It was a storehouse, and as best as I could judge, there was the big open space we stood in now, with us and the little lab at one and vats lining the path to the door.\\xa0 The space between vats had been kept clear, once.\\xa0 Now it held corpses.\\xa0 Three doors led to side rooms.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She stirred, twisting to look at me.</p>\\n<p>I pointed at the open space.\\xa0 \\u201cTraining yard?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon says he doesn\\u2019t know how to fight.\\xa0 How do they learn?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPercy didn\\u2019t know more than what a fencing hobby taught him, and he taught me a lot.\\xa0 He pit us against one another.\\xa0 If we did well, we got praised.\\xa0 If we could teach a form or a technique to the others, we got rewards.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you were good at that,\\u201d I said, without looking at Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I picked my way over the bodies until I found one that was roughly halfway intact.\\xa0 I moved the head until it faced me, examining it.\\xa0 I could see the exposed spines, and I could prod the now-bruised, swollen intact flesh to feel them beneath.\\xa0 Running my finger one way, it was smooth.\\xa0 The other way, I could feel the rasp, like brushing against stubble, only sharper.</p>\\n<p>It was hard not to draw the connection between this and Mauer\\u2019s creature.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe clone of Percy there is conducting the role you were promised you\\u2019d have.\\xa0 Looking after the next generation.\\xa0 Training them, organizing them, looking after their growth.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I did look at Mary.\\xa0 She\\u2019d stood and turned around.\\xa0 Her shoulders were drawn together.\\xa0 She replied with only a word, \\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou would have done better than this guy did,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Her eyebrows twitched.\\xa0 Her response wasn\\u2019t another rote \\u2018yes\\u2019, this time.\\xa0 I got surprised silence instead.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was saying something to Gordon, who was dividing his attention between her and my conversation with Mary.\\xa0 Jamie was at the desk in the lab, looking over notes and papers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFourteen vats,\\u201d I remarked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAcademy\\u2019s vats,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou sure?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m with Helen on this,\\u201d Jamie said, still poring over papers.\\xa0 \\u201cThey match what we use.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen nodded.</p>\\n<p>I frowned, turning to take in the space.\\xa0 \\u201cFourteen clones per generation, one generation every\\u2026 who knows how long.\\xa0 Every few months?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething like that,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI joined the Lambs a year and some months ago.\\xa0 He would have had to set this up, start it growing, then release them, and train them while starting the next batch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCrap,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I looked around.\\xa0 \\u201cFourteen vats here.\\xa0 He would have had to grow his Percies.\\xa0 Probably a whole batch, with one ghost to act as a bodyguard for each?\\xa0 And he\\u2019d used himself because\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I searched for an explanation and floundered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEgo,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause he needed a source material with a high native intelligence.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut it\\u2019s still different,\\u201d I observed.\\xa0 \\u201cYou noticed a clear difference that wasn\\u2019t just a change in appearance or effective age.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMannerisms, behavior, the way he holds himself\\u2026 completely different person.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>It was disconcerting to be having this conversation, cajoling Mary in this way, this department, when I\\u2019d spent the first few months around her trying to create a distance between her and Percy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t like how these numbers are adding up,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIs anyone else feeling it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s fast,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cVery fast, to have clones created, up and running.\\xa0 I mean, they\\u2019re mostly nonverbal, aside from the ability to run through scripts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDidn\\u2019t run into that,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe did,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are elements missing, but this is a scary amount of progress for, what, months?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMonths,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I was starting to see the bigger picture.\\xa0 I moved quickly between the bodies, turning them over, turning heads, looking for hair color, body type, and other traits.</p>\\n<p>I found what I was looking for, unfortunately.\\xa0 A Percy, malformed, with more of the spines inside him.\\xa0 His chest had only partially developed, spines sticking out, leaving him looking odd at best, horrific at worst.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExponential growth,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne generation every few months, each one with a Percy that can study and learn from his creator, then go off to start a new cell.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLess trained than what he did with <em>us</em>,\\u201d Mary said, \\u201cBut with a great deal of inherent ability, thanks to their echolocation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich seems pretty heavily inspired by Mauer\\u2019s creature,\\u201d I remarked.\\xa0 I snapped my fingers twice, trying to place it-</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhiskers,\\u201d Jamie supplied.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFail to find and uproot every single cell, and the problem just reasserts itself within the year.\\xa0 All with the <em>real</em> Percy in the background, patching up problems with the system, revising his work, running interference, organizing the organizers.\\xa0 Apparently with the cooperation of others.\\xa0 Mauer included.\\xa0 Our enemies are banding together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We took in the implications, sharing looks, Jamie looking up from his papers, Lillian from the Percy, Gordon, Dog and Catcher gathered against the far wall, and the rest of us amid the carnage of the shattered vats.</p>\\n<p>Gordon broke the silence, \\u201cDog and I were discussing it while we waited for you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDog can\\u2019t talk,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Dog huffed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe talks well enough.\\xa0 What we\\u2019re thinking is this isn\\u2019t as bad as it could be.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s pretty damn bad, Gordon,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt has the potential to be.\\xa0 But it\\u2019s not there yet.\\xa0 Even if we assume the quick timeline, they\\u2019re only just getting started.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly just?\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf we look at the scale, here, it could be fifteen cells in fifteen cities.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHell of a lot better than two hundred,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe wouldn\\u2019t aim for two hundred,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cToo much exposure, too hard to communicate, too easy for one to get found out and for everything to crumble.\\xa0 Better to aim for fifty.\\xa0 Something in that neighborhood is still very hard to wipe out, even with the Academy\\u2019s coordinated resources.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cThat makes sense.\\xa0 Fold the extras into the existing cells for training and reinforcement?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Until a cell reaches a certain size.\\xa0 When they do, have them <em>achieve</em> something.\\xa0 Take out key players, go on the offense,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon had joined the conversation, and it was mostly bouncing between him and Mary now.\\xa0 I was content to let it happen, the two of them going at it, getting into the details and figuring out implications.\\xa0 I turned away, picking my way past glass and blood to access the first of the doors.</p>\\n<p>Bunk beds, not true bunk beds, but crude ones.\\xa0 Fifteen in one large room, the \\u2018beds\\u2019 simply cloths hooked to posts with metal rings.\\xa0 I peeked, and I climbed up one post to check the upper levels, but I didn\\u2019t find much.\\xa0 A twist of dead flowers, a trio of small quartz crystals, a stuffed animal, some marbles.</p>\\n<p>I hopped down.\\xa0 The others were still talking.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFood.\\xa0 Biomass,\\u201d Lillian was saying.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBottlenecks,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian was saying growth wouldn\\u2019t be boundless, not forever.\\xa0 There are factors that control how much they can expand.\\xa0 They need weapons-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He indicated Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey need the vats, and they need biomass.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I approached the second door and pushed it open.\\xa0 I wrinkled my nose at the smell.\\xa0 I was reminded of compost and dying flesh.\\xa0 The room was unlit, but the shelves on either side were stacked with bottles of varying contents and bags much like the bags that would hold flour.\\xa0 Food, supplies, and probably formula to fill the vats with.\\xa0 In the dead center was the carriage with its four stitched horses.\\xa0 Wires ran down the wooden shelves to the horses, clipped onto the bolts at the horses\\u2019 shoulders.\\xa0 If and when there was a storm, they\\u2019d receive their power.</p>\\n<p>Catcher spoke, \\u201cWhen you talk about biomass, are you thinking of the captured children?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn part,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut there would have to be more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere is more,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFood here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe was making the purchases himself, I think,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I traced my way through the rest of the building, trying to draw a complete mental picture of how they operated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCommunication,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot a bottleneck, but it\\u2019s something they were apparently <em>very</em> focused on.\\xa0 The language the creations devised between themselves, \\u201d</p>\\n<p>Of course Jamie would think of communication.\\xa0 He\\u2019d kept a thumb on the enemy\\u2019s line of communication for a while back in Whitney.\\xa0 His secondary focus throughout the war had been on trying to figure out what the enemy was <em>saying </em>and how.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMakes sense,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s their biggest vulnerability.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny signs of anything?\\u201d I asked Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201cOn that desk over there?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shook his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPens, paper, scrips from purchases of everything from clothes to food to firewood, scripts for the ghosts.\\xa0 Conversation practice, selling themselves, logs on growth, it doesn\\u2019t sound like he expected every single one of the clones in this batch to make it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s another upside,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlways looking on the bright side of life, Gordon?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrying,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>With that word and the faintly strained tone he\\u2019d used, my head turned.\\xa0 I studied him in more depth, this time around.</p>\\n<p>He hadn\\u2019t budged from where he stood.\\xa0 He was hiding that he was in bad shape, and it had nothing to do with what the ghosts had done.\\xa0 I met his eyes, and it was clear he knew I\\u2019d realized.\\xa0 His expression was stoic as he stared me down.</p>\\n<p>I turned away, heading for the third door.\\xa0 Jamie had mentioned firewood, and the clones had needed to eat.</p>\\n<p>The interior of the third room was indeed a kitchen, with a small personal area for the Percy, complete with room for washing in the corner and an Academy uniform hanging above, dripping into the shallow basket.\\xa0 There was a wood stove, and food sat here and there.\\xa0 The window was open, the curtains billowing, water gathering on the sloped windowsill and dripping outdoors.</p>\\n<p>I put out a hand.\\xa0 The stove was hot.</p>\\n<p>Lunchtime had been a bit ago.\\xa0 Gordon and Shipman had had their meal, we\\u2019d set out.\\xa0 It was later in the day, but it wasn\\u2019t quite suppertime, and why start up the oven so early, without even having food out to cook?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I had to raise my voice to be heard in the next room.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen you came in, what was the Percy doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot sure.\\xa0 We were a little preoccupied.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I searched for tools, found a poker with a bend at the tip, and used it to turn the key that unlatched the door of the stove.\\xa0 Warm air and ash billowed out as the heat escaped into the only-slightly-cooler kitchen.\\xa0 They hadn\\u2019t shoveled out all of the ash in recent memory.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe ghosts were waiting for you?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly a couple.\\xa0 The rest were on our heels.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>They sensed him.\\xa0 They stood their ground, while Percy did what?</em></p>\\n<p><em>Busied himself with the stove?</em></p>\\n<p>I stuck the poker into the stove, raking it through the ash and the logs.\\xa0 I saw flakes that suggested paper and proved absolutely nothing, and, after a little bit more digging, moving one log, I hooked onto a thin bit of wood that the log\\u2019s weight had squashed.</p>\\n<p>That piece of wood was connected to another piece of wood, and another, with fine nails glowing pink from heat.\\xa0 The fire had burned most of everything, leaving only a portion of a circular base, a hinge, and fine constructions of wood.\\xa0 Decorative more than anything, with space between.</p>\\n<p>I pulled it free, closing my eyes and turning my face away, and walked into the other room, holding it out in front of me.\\xa0 I passed Helen and the children.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026scattered, passing on messages,\\u201d Jamie was saying.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe ghosts we released?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll split up, notify other cells.\\xa0 Even if we manage to track one, which we probably can\\u2019t, we\\u2019d find another cell.\\xa0 What\\u2019s that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy counter-theory to your thoughts on how the other cells are getting their intel and warnings,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 I waved it in front of everyone.\\xa0 \\u201cAny guesses?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBirdcage,\\u201d Gordon said, a half-second before Mary and Helen said it simultaneously.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBirdcage,\\u201d Jamie said, late, probably to feel included.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou guys take all of the fun out of guessing games,\\u201d I told them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe burned the evidence?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe did,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think he burned paper, too, so don\\u2019t strain yourself.\\xa0 Whatever you\\u2019re looking for, it\\u2019s gone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie sighed.\\xa0 He straightened from where he\\u2019d been leaning over the papers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBirdcage\\u2026 messenger birds?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI imagine so,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot a big birdcage, so we\\u2019d have to rake the coals to see if there are any more hinges from other cages.\\xa0 Otherwise, it\\u2019s just the one.\\xa0 You didn\\u2019t happen to see a whole flock of birds take off around the time you approached?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Dog exchanged a glance.\\xa0 They shook their heads in unison.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny birds at all?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t really what we were focusing on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould be handy if you noted the direction,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that they say about messenger birds?\\xa0 It\\u2019s not that they\\u2019re clever enough to find their way to their destination every single time\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re dumb because they only know how to fly one place.\\xa0 Home,\\u201d Jamie finished for me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould be nice to know where \\u2018home\\u2019 is,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf Percy\\u2019s coordinating, the birds would be flying straight to him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re making too many assumptions,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are more complex birds.\\xa0 Ones for war, with strange flying patterns, or more complex flight paths for going between multiple destinations.\\xa0 The Academy uses them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>The Academy uses them, </em>I thought.</p>\\n<p>I looked at the vats.\\xa0 I thought about the carriages.\\xa0 The uniforms.</p>\\n<p>I turned my attention to Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOur puppeteer sure likes co-opting the enemy\\u2019s system, doesn\\u2019t he?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you getting at?\\u201d she asked me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s using Academy vats.\\xa0 How did he get them?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you accusing me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, no, no.\\xa0 I\\u2019m asking you, because you have the best insight into who Percy is and how he thinks.\\xa0 He\\u2019s using Academy uniforms, he\\u2019s using a convincing carriage of Academy make.\\xa0 The mice back in the shims thought it was the Academy doing all of this.\\xa0 What if it <em>was</em>?\\xa0 In the chaos and confusion of the war, how many people are really checking and double-checking the books, making sure everything adds up and nothing\\u2019s going missing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA mole,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I held up the burned birdcage.\\xa0 \\u201cA little birdy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon straightened, stepping away from the wall.</p>\\n<p>Dog growled at the sudden movement.\\xa0 Gordon paused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGordon?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 She\\u2019d approached the rest of us, stepping away from the sea of dead clones.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Catcher, and thought about him telling me about how I needed to put trust in Gordon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf he says it\\u2019s okay, it\\u2019s okay,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d Mary started.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not really okay,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut it\\u2019s not getting better and it hasn\\u2019t been getting worse while I\\u2019ve been sitting around here.\\xa0 Best thing I can do is get to the Academy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly my heart.\\xa0 Dog doesn\\u2019t like the sound of how it\\u2019s beating, and I gotta say I don\\u2019t love how it feels there in my chest.\\xa0 Something stopped working right when Dog and I were running around,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He smiled a little.\\xa0 \\u201cNo big, but I think I\\u2019ll have to ask for my team to stop whatever they\\u2019re doing and give me my appointment sooner than later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think?\\u201d I asked, at the same time Mary gave him an incredulous, \\u201cNo big?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing we can do about it here,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought I\\u2019d tell you I had to go to the Academy after you figured out where you were going, and I could brief Hayle while you went gallivanting off, but since we\\u2019re all going to the Academy anyway, let\\u2019s get going?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t miss the faintest hint of anxiety in his tone, however well he was working to hide it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Dog was, as it happened, very useful when it came to forging a way through busy streets.\\xa0 People and horses were daunted by him, and a way naturally cleared as the ghost\\u2019s carriage took us to the Academy.\\xa0 Catcher rode on top with Mary, the others were in the back with the three kids, and Jamie and I were the designated lookouts, standing on a rail at the back, gripping the rail that ran around the top.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The ghosts were nowhere to be seen.\\xa0 That was, perhaps, the entire point of them, to be evasive and subtle, but Jamie had good eyes, and I could be fairly alert when I focused on the task, and it didn\\u2019t make sense that they would be <em>this</em> hard to find.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We passed the Lambsbridge Orphanage and started up the incline to the Academy itself.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I stared at Mary\\u2019s bloodstained back.\\xa0 Her clothing was all stiff where the blood had dried on, and Lillian had ripped it at the side to have more room to work with.\\xa0 I could see the side of Mary\\u2019s stomach, painted in a mottling of blood.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat are you thinking?\\u201d Jamie murmured.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cA lot of things.\\xa0 It\\u2019s how I work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBelieve me, I know how you work,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know you\\u2019re out here because you don\\u2019t want to be in there.\\xa0 You\\u2019re avoiding Gordon and you\\u2019re dodging the subject with indirect answers like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOh man, Jamie, no.\\xa0 You sound like me.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t do that to yourself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cFor most of the day, you\\u2019ve had me working to emulate the other Lambs.\\xa0 You, mostly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019ve ruined you,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cProbably.\\xa0 But what are you thinking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou already asked that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAre you afraid to tell me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I sighed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to.\\xa0 I know you care about us.\\xa0 You look after us more than you like to admit.\\xa0 Keep the balance, keep confidences, push us when we need pushing.\\xa0 But when it comes to you\\u2026 well, I see it as my responsibility to ask you if you\\u2019re okay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m fine,\\u201d I said, breezily.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re fine as long as the rest of us are fine.\\xa0 But we\\u2019ve gone without appointments for a stretch longer than normal.\\xa0 Things that were close to breaking down are breaking down, and it\\u2019s a little scary to see all at once.\\xa0 You\\u2019re struggling, Gordon\\u2019s struggling.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMary getting hurt had nothing to do with appointments.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBut she got hurt,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd maybe you\\u2019re wondering if she would\\u2019ve gotten hurt if we were all in top form?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201c<em>Now</em> I am.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSy,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf something happens, today, tomorrow, in a week, a month, or a year\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhen,\\u201d I corrected.\\xa0 Odd to be the one correcting Jamie.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen, not if.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhen.\\xa0 Are you going to be okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019ve been bracing myself for this for years now.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve known the estimated dates since before we had Mary.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve mourned and made the most of my time with everyone.\\xa0 I\\u2019m fine.\\xa0 Really.\\xa0 But I\\u2019m not sure the group is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie was quiet.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t look at me, still focused on his job, studying the surroundings, searching for ghosts in daylight.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I swallowed.\\xa0 \\u201cGordon was ready to leave, you know.\\xa0 Back with Fray?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThings have changed since then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHe\\u2019s always been more independent than the rest of us.\\xa0 If something happens, if the group cohesion breaks down, if there are hurt feelings, I really truly believe we might see Gordon break away.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re not disagreeing with me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t disagree.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I paused, taking that in.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMary,\\u201d I said, lowering my voice so I could be sure Mary wouldn\\u2019t hear.\\xa0 \\u201cWith the way things stand now-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWith Percy.\\xa0 Yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Enough said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd Helen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHelen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI just\\u2026 I have this horrible image in my head about the way things are flowing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cExplain?\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think about things the way you do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe\\u2019s loyal to Ibott.\\xa0 And Ibott is loyal to his aspirations, and Hayle probably told Ibott that if the man wanted an in with the nobility, working on something like Helen would be that in, and now the stars have aligned and Ibott is greedy and\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201c\\u2026I see where you\\u2019re going.\\xa0 Nothing concrete.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNothing concrete, no.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBut it\\u2019s believable.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.\\xa0 I felt both relieved and horrified to speak my fears aloud and have them validated.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd there\\u2019s Lillian,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t see her running off, but I- I don\\u2019t see her staying?\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know it doesn\\u2019t make sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI can see both,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt depends what happens.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I heaved out another sigh.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019ll feel better after an appointment,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019ll feel tons worse after an appointment.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t lie to me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd after that, you\\u2019ll feel better,\\u201d he clarified.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI hope so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The side door opened.\\xa0 The person within waited until we passed another cart going the opposite way, one that held an animal inside, then opened the door.\\xa0 It was Lillian.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She gave me a fleeting smile before working her way along the side of the carriage, stepping up onto the cover above the wheel so she was beside Mary.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie and I were quiet as we watched Lillian poke and prod.\\xa0 She said something to the effect of, \\u201c-want to do a last-minute check in case someone grades my work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary patiently sat through Lillian\\u2019s ministrations.\\xa0 She glanced back at us, and rolled her eyes, before a bump in the road made her have to reach out to catch her balance, and grab for Lil\\u2019s shoulder, to make sure Lillian didn\\u2019t bounce off.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We were at the last leg.\\xa0 The group at the gate obediently got out of the way as Dog approached.\\xa0 They remembered last time.\\xa0 It put a smile on my face.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian hopped down to the step beneath the door, then crossed back to Jamie and I, where we stood on the rear end of the carriage, looking over the top.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHi,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI wanted to thank you, Jamie.\\xa0 For backing me up.\\xa0 I think I did okay, and I wouldn\\u2019t have without you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou know it didn\\u2019t happen like that,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf you\\u2019re talking about me having it in me all along, Jamie, I have to tell you you\\u2019re full of horse-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d I cut her off.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie didn\\u2019t help you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHe-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou know what happens if they find out he knows this much,\\u201d I said, and my tone was grim.\\xa0 \\u201cThe project gets canceled.\\xa0 Or very heavily <em>revised</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI know that.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not going to say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOr hint,\\u201d I said, \\u201cOr thank Jamie, or mention it ever again.\\xa0 Because it didn\\u2019t happen.\\xa0 It won\\u2019t ever happen again.\\xa0 And if you happen to imagine something like that happening again, in dire circumstances?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m only imagining it,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGood girl,\\u201d I said, my voice quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd Catcher, Dog?\\xa0 I know your hearing is good enough to have overheard everything.\\xa0 I\\u2019m trusting you two to keep mum.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was no reaction from either.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI didn\\u2019t even imagine they were listening in,\\u201d Lillian said, quiet.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey\\u2019re good guys,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOthers aren\\u2019t.\\xa0 Be careful.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She nodded.\\xa0 She turned to go back inside the carriage, then stopped and turned back our way.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen Mary was fading out, she was babbling.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou had your chance?\\xa0 She said that to you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was a long silence.\\xa0 We passed under the gate.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOkay then.\\xa0 I feel like I\\u2019m always one step behind,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSy told you something before you performed the surgery on Mary,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have to be proactive.\\xa0 Step up and find the courage.\\xa0 Pay attention to the sentiment.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll always regret what you don\\u2019t do more than what you do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cTechnically Gordon said that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou said it too.\\xa0 It\\u2019s good advice.\\xa0 What I\\u2019m getting at is, if you want something, fight for it.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re falling behind, work hard and catch up.\\xa0 If you want to say something, then say it.\\xa0 But don\\u2019t waver.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s not that easy,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOf course not.\\xa0 It\\u2019s <em>hard</em>,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut things worth having are worth the work, don\\u2019t you think?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He gave me a look.\\xa0 I thought about how we\\u2019d talked about group cohesion.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Apt.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYeah, Jamie,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think I understand what you\\u2019re saying.\\xa0 I\\u2019m going to think on it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOkay,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It took her a few seconds to maneuver her way into the carriage without letting the door swing out to hit a bystander on the crowded street.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe is a bit of a scaredy cat, isn\\u2019t she?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI <em>really</em> need an appointment, because I\\u2019m not sure I got any of that,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe was asking about you and Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUh huh.\\xa0 I got that much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd Lillian was trying to work up the courage to ask you about you and <em>Lillian</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAlright,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s really that important.\\xa0 We have bigger things to focus

style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m not stringing anyone along.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not even sure there\\u2019s a string,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Images of Mary and the razor wires and knives in that little space under the stairs flew through my mind.\\xa0 \\u201cOr there is, I- I\\u2019m not sure.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s fair to ask me to be sure one way or the other when I

at the top of the carriage.\\xa0 \\u201cI trust you, Sy.\\xa0 You\\u2019re smart enough to know when you\\u2019ve figured it out, and I hope you\\u2019re kind enough to let us know as soon as you

Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cUs is right.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve been spared the Gordon infatuation, he\\u2019s very much into girls, as his fling with Shipman suggests.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve been spared the horrors of having <em>Helen</em> be attracted to you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He gave me an impish look, smiling, as if expecting me to laugh along with him.\\xa0 My expression was still.\\xa0 I saw the expression fade.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Dead serious, Jamie continued, \\u201cBut half the Lambs have figured out what Gordon didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Or maybe Gordon did figure it out and that\\u2019s why he broke it off with Shipman.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t expect any non-Lamb to really connect with us.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think it works.\\xa0 They can\\u2019t keep up, they can\\u2019t draw close enough.\\xa0 They don\\u2019t understand.\\xa0 And with only six of us, it\\u2019s a pretty narrow pool to pick from.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cJamie, no,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>No.</em>\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cI thought as much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p

style=\"text-align:left;\">He was being so cavalier about it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I had a lump in my throat.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey can fix that, you know,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie\\u2019s smile was a sad one.\\xa0 \\u201cNo need.\\xa0 I\\u2019m okay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/10/01/lamb-to-the-slaughter-6-9/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>They circled like vultures.\\xa0 I counted six in total that were in plain view.\\xa0 All with effective reflexes and spatial awareness.\\xa0 The screeching as we were circled was mine, however, a scrape of blade against glass, back and forth, a staccato nails-on-a-blackboard noise that made the little hairs on my arms and neck stand on end.</p>\\n<p>It was giving them pause, but I could read their body language now that I could track them consistently.\\xa0 They were building up confidence to attack.\\xa0 They\\u2019d seen one of their own die, and the noise of blade on glass was screwing with their senses.\\xa0 I imagined it was like being thrust from the bright world into darkness for the very first time.</p>\\n<p>The thought of darkness made me glance at Mary, who was being worked on by Lillian.\\xa0 I really didn\\u2019t like the expression on Lillian\\u2019s face.</p>\\n<p><em>Focus</em>, I told myself.\\xa0 Adrenaline went a long way in helping me to pull my thoughts together.\\xa0 The edges around the thoughts felt sharper and the details more crisp.\\xa0 I felt more like myself, I could touch on a thought in the middle of a running stream of consciousness and that thought was crystal clear.</p>\\n<p>I tested the knife in my hand, judging its weight.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d practiced some, one didn\\u2019t spend more than a year in Mary\\u2019s company without trying it out, but the benefits of practice had been questionable.\\xa0 I\\u2019d pick it up after four or five throws, then I\\u2019d actually be pretty good, landing about three in four thereafter.\\xa0 Then I\\u2019d try again the next night, and I\\u2019d need a few throws worth of practice again.</p>\\n<p>The women started, making motions like they were going to attack.</p>\\n<p><em>\\u2018Feint</em><em>\\u2018 </em>was my immediate thought.</p>\\n<p>Catcher reacted all the same.\\xa0 The butt end of his weapon slapped out.\\xa0 he struck a window, hard enough to shatter it, the glass breaking, the crash sharp enough to give our attackers pause.</p>\\n<p>Not that they\\u2019d been going anywhere, not really.</p>\\n<p>Still, it was opportunity.</p>\\n<p>I threw, roughly the same time Jamie did.</p>\\n<p>Our targets didn\\u2019t even move.\\xa0 The knives went flying off, far from being on target.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s went straight over his target\\u2019s head by at least a foot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re doomed,\\u201d Mary\\u2019s voice was faint.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t need commentary!\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWasting good knives,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShush!\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cYour arms are shorter than mine are.\\xa0 Release later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGot it,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat about me?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve given you advice\\u2026 hunnred times,\\u201d she mumbled.\\xa0 \\u201cWaste.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I really didn\\u2019t like how fast she was dropping off, here.</p>\\n<p>The women moved, I scratched glass with the tool, and they halted.\\xa0 I tried throwing again.</p>\\n<p>My target didn\\u2019t even dodge, for the second time.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s did, but I doubted he\\u2019d been on target.</p>\\n<p>That was what I was telling myself.\\xa0 No way was Jamie going to be better than me at this and get to be the hero.</p>\\n<p>They made a move to approach, and I scratched the glass again.\\xa0 I figured they were feinting or uncertain, but I wanted to tell them off all the same.\\xa0 Warn them, feed that uncertainty.</p>\\n<p>My damn hands were shaking.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t helping my accuracy or concentration.</p>\\n<p>Jamie, Helen and I weren\\u2019t strong.\\xa0 Catcher was, but Catcher was guarding Lillian and Mary.\\xa0 Each of the ghosts was capable and dangerous.</p>\\n<p>When our ghostly vultures swooped in, I didn\\u2019t think much of our chances.</p>\\n<p>It was too easy to let my thoughts run away.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t someone who won fights.\\xa0 At best, I helped find the road to victory.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, no, no,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 Her voice was breaking.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease, Mary, no.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>In my peripheral vision, I could see Mary drawing closer to the ground.\\xa0 Catcher let her slump down, easing the drop by slowly relaxing his hold on her.\\xa0 Lillian did much of the work in draping Mary out alongside the gutter at the base of a storefront.</p>\\n<p>My hand tightened on the knife\\u2019s handle.\\xa0 As I turned away, I sensed movement, and moved to react.</p>\\n<p>Three of them were closing the distance, using our collective distraction as an opportunity.\\xa0 Two women with blonde hair and a brunette, drawing in close, fast enough I wasn\\u2019t sure I\\u2019d get my arms up in time.</p>\\n<p>Catcher acted.\\xa0 His weapon reached for one of the blondes, who immediately reversed direction, backing away out of range.\\xa0 He wasn\\u2019t striking at her, however.\\xa0 His weapon reached further, and one of the jutting spikes touched the wrought-iron railing I\\u2019d pointed out earlier.</p>\\n<p>Swiping violently <em>away</em> from the enemy, he dragged metal against metal, eliciting a screech that made my vision waver.\\xa0 The two attackers stopped in their tracks, momentarily stunned or disoriented.</p>\\n<p>I saw opportunity and went for it, knife in hand, the rest of the string of knives dangling, stabbing.</p>\\n<p>She backhanded the wrist of my knife hand, hard. I didn\\u2019t make contact, and the entire string of knives fell from my hand.\\xa0 I reached out to catch it in the middle with my other hand, which still held the round blade, simultaneously trying to grab at her wrist with the hand she\\u2019d just disarmed.</p>\\n<p>I realized, around the time I sort of failed at both, that I was doing exactly what Gordon always accused me of.\\xa0 Trying to do too many things at once.\\xa0 The disarmed hand was still smarting from the blow and was slow to move.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t get a grip on her wrist.</p>\\n<p>The hand that was grabbing the mess of knives and wire <em>did</em> grab what I was going for, but there were more sharp edges and lengths of wire than there were things to properly <em>grip, </em>and I only got the middle of the length.\\xa0 Wires cut into the webbing between four different fingers as I got a grip on the knife handle between my middle and ring finger.</p>\\n<p>There was no time to adjust, or move, or do different, or even to make sure the wire wasn\\u2019t wrapped around my hand in a way that would make any action on my part hurt me more than it hurt her.\\xa0 I whipped the twin lengths at her upper body and face.</p>\\n<p>I grazed her.\\xa0 I felt the impact, I saw her flinch, before she retreated well out of my reach.\\xa0 Superficial damage.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t make a sound as she reeled, face twisting, one eye closed, a lick of crimson at one cheek.</p>\\n<p>Small as it was, it was perhaps my greatest victory in an out-and-out fight yet.</p>\\n<p>I had to think like they thought, connect the dots, figure out how they operated and mess with that.\\xa0 This was an unrefined project, untested in a combat situation.\\xa0 They weren\\u2019t soldiers.\\xa0 They were assassins, and they were still raw enough and new enough to the world that the unfamiliar could put them off balance.\\xa0 The jangle of blades and the nature of my attack had been strange to her.</p>\\n<p>Strange enough to get the blades a half-inch closer to her face and upper chest.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and Helen were together, dealing with the other one.\\xa0 She stood close enough that Jamie <em>should</em> have been able to swing and make contact, even with her being as fast as she was, but it wasn\\u2019t happening.\\xa0 He tried, she stepped away, and she kicked him, hard enough that he stumbled into the storefront behind us.</p>\\n<p>Helen maneuvered to corner the woman, keeping one eye out to the side and behind her for any surprise or flank attacks, but the woman easily danced to one side, putting Jamie between herself and Helen, before stepping back a fraction to avoid a furtive slash.</p>\\n<p>Jamie and Helen were getting further from the rest of us as they tried to keep their distance from their assailant.\\xa0 I wanted to shout something, a warning, but I couldn\\u2019t afford to take my attention off the one I\\u2019d just injured.</p>\\n<p>I adjusted my grip on the wires and blades, trying to make sure I was in a position to respond if she lunged for me, and probably failing.\\xa0 I had to work to get one wire out of the webbing where it had bitten down between my index finger and thumb.</p>\\n<p>Blood ran down my hand and dripped from my fingertips as I gripped the ring.\\xa0 I swiped it against the window, and the blonde woman in front of me lunged.\\xa0 Again, I swung the tangle of wires and knives in her direction.</p>\\n<p>Too quick, for how slow she was on the approach.\\xa0 I finished swinging the moment before she got close.</p>\\n<p>Her palm thrust out, slapping my forehead, driving my head back into the window with enough force that it cracked.\\xa0 The effect on my vision was about the same as what they were probably experiencing when I scraped the glass.\\xa0 Distortion, no strange colors or sights, but a momentary loss of the ability to put the pieces together.</p>\\n<p>She held my head against the broken edges of the window, gripping my head hard enough to bend it back, tilting my chin up.</p>\\n<p>Her other hand went up like she was going to slap me across the face, but I could see the blade, flat against her palm, held between two fingers.\\xa0 It was my throat, not my face, that she intended to strike.</p>\\n<p>Efficient, almost surgical execution.</p>\\n<p>I kicked at her legs.\\xa0 She was able to avoid the worst of it, pulling her legs back out of my way, while adding to the press of my head against glass, jagged shards like a half dozen individual knives cutting me.</p>\\n<p>Catcher acted once more.\\xa0 Another swipe at the railing, fierce, this time swinging forward, simultaneously swiping at the three of the women who were surrounding him.\\xa0 They would be trying to find an avenue to get past Catcher and attack Lillian and Mary.</p>\\n<p>It was a distraction, and I saw my attacker wince, but she didn\\u2019t let up the pressure on me.</p>\\n<p>Catcher hadn\\u2019t stopped moving, however.\\xa0 He\\u2019d pulled another weapon from his coat.\\xa0 The woman who held me released me, stepping back to preserve herself.</p>\\n<p>And my foot, which had been kicking at her, went up, the toe hooking under the front of her dress.\\xa0 As she tried to back up and evade the incoming attack, I caught her.\\xa0 She stumbled a little, I was hauled back and away from the window, feeling the glass slash me as I was hauled past it.</p>\\n<p>She slashed at the fabric to sever it and free herself, but the delay cost her a half second\\u2019s time and a moment of her attention.\\xa0 Catcher\\u2019s weapon, akin to a bear-trap on a leash, slapped against the side of her face.\\xa0 It bit deep.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t make a sound as he hauled on the cord.\\xa0 She clutched blindly at the contraption, but the teeth had sunken in, and she didn\\u2019t have the leverage to remove it.\\xa0 Blood welled out around the edges of the trap\\u2019s teeth, too slick for her to get a grip on the metal.</p>\\n<p>All but one of the women around us were backing off, now.\\xa0 Helen had the other blonde in her grip, the two of them on the ground, Jamie stepping on the woman\\u2019s head, knives in hand, watching Helen\\u2019s back.\\xa0 Catcher\\u2019s distraction had been well timed.</p>\\n<p>I could see how the women were watching the one in the bear trap.</p>\\n<p>I could feel it in my teeth, the harshness that cut through the humid air.\\xa0 A sound I couldn\\u2019t quite perceive.\\xa0 Different from what Catcher had described as a cacophony.</p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019s screaming</em>.</p>\\n<p>She was stumbling left, then right, hands scrabbling in a futile fashion, and she was utterly silent, but for the clack of the metal ring that was attached to the cord, banging against bloodstained steel.\\xa0 She reached the limit of her movement, the teeth pulling against flesh, and her entire body arched and spasmed with pain.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHelen,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes?\\xa0 Is Mary okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Finish fast,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>I swallowed hard.\\xa0 Catcher\\u2019s \\u2018<em>No\\u2019\\xa0</em>hit me harder than I\\u2019d expected.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAw.\\xa0 I never get to take my time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Catcher was silent, studying the enemy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease, Helen,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNext time, I promise.\\xa0 But this is serious.\\xa0 Do it for Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t going to say <em>no</em>,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cMove your foot, Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Off to my left, Helen moved.\\xa0 Cartilage and bone snapped and ground together as Helen strained, a torture rack in human form.\\xa0 I imagined I could hear the silent scream from Helen\\u2019s victim as her arms were stretched out and to either side, like a bird.\\xa0 Helen\\u2019s body shifted, bones standing out in strange ways against skin or the fabric of her clothes, a biological equivalent to a spring or mechanism being set, a trigger cocked.\\xa0 Her hands bit deep enough into skin that I wondered if she was squeezing muscle aside to press against bone.\\xa0 Flesh between fingers was bulging like it might pop.</p>\\n<p>Then Helen readjusted.\\xa0 It was a sudden, violent movement, the twist of a constrictor snake seizing its prey all at once, contorting itself in knots in a sudden, spasmodic way.\\xa0 Her body could move like that, but the body of the victim that was securely in her grip couldn\\u2019t.\\xa0 The wet sounds and the crunch of bone and gristle against more bone and gristle seemed to go on forever.</p>\\n<p>Helen hadn\\u2019t done anything but twist and wrench, but she was still bloody as she picked herself up and off of her victim.\\xa0 Her bones were still in weird places, like she had a feline or a lizard\\u2019s skeleton inside a little girl\\u2019s skin, the limbs too long, the shoulders oddly skewed.\\xa0 She sagged under her own weight, her muscle structure not lending itself well to standing upright.\\xa0 Slowly, piece by piece, she pulled herself back into a more normal configuration.</p>\\n<p>The ghosts were utterly still, standing a fair distance away.</p>\\n<p>Catcher\\u2019s captive grew ever more feeble, before sinking to her knees.\\xa0 She hit ground more violently than Mary had, bear-trap first, a sharp impact that didn\\u2019t make her move or flinch at all.\\xa0 Passed out.</p>\\n<p>Catcher used one hand to reel her in as he spoke, a sharp order cutting into the silence, \\u201cStop talking.\\xa0 Listen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Rain pattered down around us.\\xa0 I chanced a look at Mary and Lillian.\\xa0 Lillian was moving so frantically, and Mary wasn\\u2019t moving at all.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you want to pick this fight, we <em>will</em> win,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd the next time, Helen there will have the leeway to draw it out, to make it <em>hurt</em>-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-And I will use some of my best tricks and tools, to make you wish you had <em>her</em> attention instead of mine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen gave Catcher an annoyed look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou hurt one of ours,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m being merciful, because I\\u2019m going to give you a chance to run.\\xa0 Leave the area.\\xa0 Go in any direction but that one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He pointed in the general direction of Percy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t try to be clever, tr- I told you to <em>stop talking.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could see the tension in his stance.\\xa0 He looked around him, and as he did, I cocked my head to one side, to get his attention.\\xa0 His eye fell on me as he finished reeling up the chain, the body dragged to his feet.\\xa0 He stepped on her throat and hauled the bear-trap-ish thing up and away.\\xa0 It pulled free, taking generous handfuls of flesh with it, and snapped the rest of the way closed.</p>\\n<p>He held his hand at his side in a very deliberate way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t double back,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t try to trick us, or notify anyone.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re good about this, if you-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He stopped.\\xa0 His finger twitched.</p>\\n<p>I scraped the blade across the glass, hard.\\xa0 The women reacted.</p>\\n<p><em>Stop talking</em>, I thought to myself.\\xa0 <em>Listen</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAhem,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you\\u2019re good about this, I\\u2019ll offer the same chance to any of your sisters who get in our way, and give a quick death to those who can\\u2019t or won\\u2019t leave.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The scene was still.\\xa0 I felt the heat and the exhaustion of our exertion now more than I had during, even with the rain running down my hair and face.\\xa0 A glance at my shoulder suggested I was losing a lot of blood, even considering that the water running through it all was making it seem like more.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t feel it, at least.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Go</em>,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>The women moved, each heading straight for the nearest piece of cover.</p>\\n<p>We collectively waited a full three seconds after they had disappeared before turning our attention to Lillian and Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re hurt,\\u201d Jamie told me, as he rushed to my side.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMary\\u2019s hurt,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian needs to focus on her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can devote some attention to you,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause you look like you need <em>something</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We collectively made our way to Mary and Lillian.\\xa0 Jamie grabbed some cloth and handed it to me, pressing it down against my scalp.\\xa0 He gestured to Helen, who was probably the worst person present to have my damaged scalp firmly in her grip, and had her keep pressure on the wound.</p>\\n<p>Lillian looked like panic had overtaken her.\\xa0 She was struggling, fumbling.</p>\\n<p>Jamie knelt down by Lillian, asking, \\u201cHow is she?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian sounded like she was on the verge of tears, her voice wobbled, \\u201cShe got stabbed right through the middle.\\xa0 In the front and out the back.\\xa0 Organs were perforated.\\xa0 She\\u2019s not good, Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFix her,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not- it\\u2019s not that easy, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s your job to keep us alive.\\xa0 If you fail at this the first real time that\\u2019s in question, I\\u2019m not sure why we keep you around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She set her jaw.\\xa0 It looked like she had tears in her eyes, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWow, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have the ability.\\xa0 But if you don\\u2019t have the <em>capability</em>, well\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re such a penis, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you\\u2019re a good doctor,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn training,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWho has <em>studied</em> this garbage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBelieve it or not, Sy, I\\u2019m only fourteen, and I <em>haven\\u2019t</em> gotten around to actual <em>surgery</em>.\\xa0 And I\\u2019m in the <em>field</em><em>, </em>too, without an operating room or all the tools.\\xa0 I\\u2019m thinking we should try transporting her to a clinic.\\xa0 If we can get Dog to carry her, I think I can keep her going long enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcuses,\\u201d I told her, \\u201cand cowardice.\\xa0 Why go that route when you can be the surer thing?\\xa0 I think you\\u2019re lying to yourself and to us, because you\\u2019re scared.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course I\\u2019m scared!\\u201d she said, her voice too high.</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s chest wasn\\u2019t even rising and falling like normal, her breaths were so shallow.\\xa0 Lillian stabbed Mary in the chest with a needle, depressing it.</p>\\n<p>Lil\\u2019s voice returned to a more normal level, \\u201cI\\u2019m being realistic.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s breathing picked up as the injection took hold, though it still wasn\\u2019t great.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re being a <em>wuss</em>.\\xa0 You know what Gordon keeps telling me?\\u201d I asked her.\\xa0 \\u201cEvery time I lose a fight, which I do a lot?\\xa0 You have to make a move, or the world will move against you.\\xa0 Take action, be brave, and leave no doubt that you exist.\\xa0 There\\u2019s too many people for any of us to fall into the background.\\xa0 Above all, trust your instincts, because you\\u2019re better than you think.\\xa0 <em>You are better than you think, Lil, </em>and I\\u2019m saying that as the person who\\xa0<em>was</em> your biggest critic, back in the day.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her smile was a grim one.</p>\\n<p>I continued, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve started fixing her up, you\\u2019ve patched up the holes, best I can figure it out, now stop making excuses and get to work, you wuss.\\xa0 She\\u2019s supposed to be your <em>best friend</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re implying-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m implying!\\u201d I raised my voice.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you wimp out on this and you let Mary die, then I\\u2019m going to forgive you\\u2026 eventually.\\xa0 We all are.\\xa0 Crap happens!\\xa0 But you?\\xa0 I know people and I know <em>you</em>, and I know that your fears drive and define you.\\xa0 If you give up here, you will never find your way back from it to become a proper doctor, and you are never, ever, <em>ever</em> going to forgive yourself for it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her face screwed up as she looked at me.\\xa0 Fresh tears were squeezed out, running down her cheeks.\\xa0 She raised her arms to try and wipe at the tears with her forearms, but they were streaked with blood.\\xa0 She let her arms drop, before emptying a bottle of powder onto her hand and daubing it around the edge of the wound.\\xa0\\xa0 Her attention fixed on Mary.</p>\\n<p>Jamie offered a handkerchief, reaching out to dab at Lillian\\u2019s eyes and cheeks.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, Jamie,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cSy?\\xa0 Remember when I called you a penis?\\xa0 I was being <em>kind</em>.\\xa0 You\\u2019re the <em>runt</em> of penises.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor the record, I agree with Sy,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He knelt beside Lillian.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t focus on what you <em>can\\u2019t</em> do.\\xa0 I know you know the stuff.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve read up on it, even if you haven\\u2019t practiced it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian shook her head.\\xa0 Small, nervous shakes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s an acronym, to get you started.\\xa0 The order in which you do this,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian\\u2019s nervousness seemed to drop away as shock took hold.\\xa0 She looked at Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know the steps,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cFirst step?\\xa0 A.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAssess,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie, you\\u2019re-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Focus</em>,\\u201d I told her, fully aware of the hypocrisy.\\xa0 Catcher was standing over us, on guard, pole in hand.\\xa0 I knew he was observing and listening.</p>\\n<p>I knew the gamble Jamie was making.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAssess,\\u201d she said, again, focusing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve assessed,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou know what the problem is.\\xa0 Next.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve laid the table as best as you\\u2019re going to get it,\\u201d Jamie said, his voice soft.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you need the tools, I\\u2019ll hand them to you.\\xa0 You\\u2019re surgeon, I\\u2019m assistant.\\xa0 Next step?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEntry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou skipped a step,\\u201d Jamie said, without missing a beat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep.\\xa0 Keep\\u2026 I- I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have the tools,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe needs blood to replace what she\\u2019s lost, and she\\u2019s going to need a lot.\\xa0 You know our blood types.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy blood is poison,\\u201d I commented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t even <em>have</em> blood, like you guys do,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can\\u2019t be my assistant<em> and</em> give blood,\\u201d Lillian said, but she was already prepping the tubing and needle.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll make it work,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cCatcher is a universal donor.\\xa0 Probably not wholly good for Mary, considering what he\\u2019s got running in his veins, but if he\\u2019s willing, I imagine <em>his</em> blood is better than not having enough blood.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.\\xa0 She started the heavier, scarier work, Jamie talking her through it all, keeping her on track.</p>\\n<p>Even the best doctors had a hard time operating on loved ones.</p>\\n<p>It was a full ten minutes before Lillian didn\\u2019t need Jamie\\u2019s help, handing her bottles and the like.\\xa0 Jamie stepped away, grabbing the stuff needed to fix my head.\\xa0 He began tending to my scalp, while trying to keep the tubing that fed blood to Mary in place.</p>\\n<p>Timid, quiet Jamie, becoming a force in his own right.</p>\\n<p>Jamie managed to offer me a small smile as I studied him.\\xa0 Lillian wasn\\u2019t panicking anymore.\\xa0 I allowed myself to feel relieved.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t spoken aloud, because nobody here wanted to jinx us like that.</p>\\n<p>Lillian\\u2019s work continued, with the tubing moving from Jamie to Catcher, so the man could supply some blood.\\xa0 The minutes that followed were a little more tense, as Mary started to dip in condition.\\xa0 More drugs and chemicals were injected into the tubing, to offset and counteract the cocktail that Catcher\\u2019s blood was dumping into her system.</p>\\n<p>A good forty minutes passed.\\xa0 I watched Lillian more than I watched Mary, because the tension in her neck and shoulders was a better indicator than the bloody mess that Lillian was digging through.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s handkerchief, previously used to wipe up Lillian\\u2019s tears, was now being used to swipe out the blood in the way.\\xa0 Lillian\\u2019s hands were inside the wound as she worked blind, periodically asking Jamie for numbers, which he rattled off.</p>\\n<p>Catcher made no comment.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was working on the cuts to my hand and Lillian\\u2019s neck and shoulders were showing less and less tension when Mary finally stirred.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWelcome back,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid we win?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause that\\u2019s our priority, huh?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYes.\\xa0 Sort of.\\xa0 We scared them off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cHelp me up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm!\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot yet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re going to lose him,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been lying there for an hour while Lillian\\u2019s been fixing you.\\xa0 Another five or ten minutes won\\u2019t hurt.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary obediently let her head down to rest on the hard surface of the road.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you want painkiller?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWould it mess up my perception, if we run into Percy?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou <em>really</em> need to get your priorities straight,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou almost died.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI agree with Sy.\\xa0 For once,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou shouldn\\u2019t be running after Percy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stuck the toe of my foot out to poke Lillian in the butt cheek.\\xa0 She gave me an offended look.</p>\\n<p>And Mary said Lillian liked being teased?\\xa0 Hmph.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to let him go,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>It was a weird phrasing, one that could be taken two ways.\\xa0 I remained silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI believe Dog and Gordon are with the man,\\u201d Catcher said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know the context, but it\\u2019s the only reason they wouldn\\u2019t have caught up with us already.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith him in a good way or a bad way?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t be a bad way,\\u201d Catcher said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey could be dead,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Death was on my mind, with Mary\\u2019s close call.</p>\\n<p>Catcher turned his head to give me a sharp look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr not,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cScratch that, ignore me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI trust Dog.\\xa0 You should trust Gordon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Too chipper a response.\\xa0 It came off as false, which it was.\\xa0 I envied Catcher his ability to trust his partner as absolutely as he did.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf he\\u2019s there, and Dog and Gordon are with him, then no painkillers,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Or should I have pitied him?\\xa0 Did he really have no choice in the matter?\\xa0 Was doubt dangerous enough that it could cost them at a critical moment?</p>\\n<p>Lillian finished.\\xa0 She leaned back, and Mary reached down to pull her shirt down.\\xa0 The expression in her face suggested she was momentarily regretting the lack of painkillers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Now</em> can I stand?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou <em>are</em> going to need a proper look from a doctor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAfter.\\xa0 We meet up with the others first,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t let it show, but a part of me recoiled at the re-emergence of this stitched-like Mary, so fixated on one thing, so detached.\\xa0 That it came when she was weak, wobbly, and her defenses stripped away was concerning.</p>\\n<p>Catcher and Jamie helped Mary to stand.\\xa0 She pulled her clothing back into order, picking for a moment at the back of her dress, which was soaked through with blood, from the shoulderblades to mid-calf.\\xa0 She looked annoyed.</p>\\n<p>My attention fell on Lillian, who was still kneeling by the patch of road that had Mary\\u2019s blood soaked into it.</p>\\n<p>I reached down and gave Lillian a pat on the head.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s a good doctor.\\xa0 Who\\u2019s a good girl?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian rolled her eyes, tried to stand, and I held her down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a good girl, yes you are!\\u201d I cooed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have sharp tools, Sy, and I\\u2019m right at eye level to stab you where it hurts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s the fifth time today you\\u2019ve made reference to that part of Sy,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Fifth?</em>\\u201d I asked, intrigued.\\xa0 I shifted position to better keep my hand on Lillian\\u2019s head, keeping her from standing.\\xa0 \\u201cDo tell.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, no.\\xa0 Some of that was said when you were out of earshot.\\xa0 It would be telling.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAw,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Now Lillian was turning pink, which was fun.\\xa0 Jamie smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet me up, Sy,\\u201d Lillian said, flushed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSay please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs this worth the risk of being stabbed?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt totally is.\\xa0 Say please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow say you\\u2019re the best little doctor in all of Radham.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI am the best doctor-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Little</em> doctor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She reached for a scalpel that lay on the street, I stepped on it before she could pick it up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI am the best doctor in all of Radham,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s all you get from me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I let her go.\\xa0 \\u201cSo long as you admit it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her face was even pinker as I let her up.\\xa0 I swiftly backed away before she could kick me.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure, but I thought she might be smiling as she picked up the tools.</p>\\n<p><em>Mission accomplished.</em></p>\\n<p>Now for the <em>true</em> task at hand.</p>\\n<p>We didn\\u2019t move very fast.\\xa0 Mary probably did need the painkiller, but was too proud to admit it, and Catcher\\u2019s legs were feeling the pain from where they\\u2019d been slashed.\\xa0 Both he and Jamie had given a generous amount of blood.\\xa0 Lillian and I helped a wobbly Jamie and Mary, while Catcher used his weapon as a staff to help keep himself steady.</p>\\n<p>Our destination was three streets down, and we didn\\u2019t see one of the ghosts en route.</p>\\n<p>Catcher pushed open the doors.</p>\\n<p>Glass tanks lined the walls of what had once been a storehouse.\\xa0 The glass was broken, the bodies within cast to the ground, not yet fully formed.\\xa0 Fine, fishlike spears of bone riddled the interiors of each body, almost hair-thin.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Catcher were with three children.\\xa0 I recognized the girl who had been taken earlier in the day, swaddled in a blanket, her hair wet.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t enough children.\\xa0 My eyes fell on the bodies from the tanks.</p>\\n<p><em>Material.</em></p>\\n<p>This would be all we could recover.\\xa0 The rest of the children were gone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEverything okay?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTook a hit, Lillian had to patch Mary up,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mary visibly rankled at that.\\xa0 To be so close to home, in a matter of speaking, and have her called out on a failure\\u2026 a mistake on my part.</p>\\n<p>As we drew closer, I could see around a desk.\\xa0 A smear of blood.\\xa0 At the base of the wall, Percy was propped up.\\xa0 One arm and both legs broken.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEnded up charging through.\\xa0 Took him down, broke the vats, the ghosts put up a brief fight, then called for a retreat,\\u201d Gordon explained, one hand going out to pat Dog\\u2019s side.\\xa0 Dog nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe retreat part might have been related to us,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHard to say.\\xa0 We\\u2019re going to have to hunt them down.\\xa0 But hey, you got Percy!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d Gordon said, and he sounded a little crestfallen, his expression falling as well.\\xa0 He looked over at the man.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary crossed the distance.\\xa0 She approached the man, and stopped as he turned his head to look at her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was an empty look, devoid of recognition.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBest Dog and I can figure,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to run two or five or ten different matching projects all in different cities, you can\\u2019t do it yourself.\\xa0 You need one clone to oversee the growth of the rest.\\xa0 And if you\\u2019re going to go that far-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s knees gave out.\\xa0 She sank slowly to the ground, kneeling ten feet in front of Percy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou might as well clone yourself?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/esprit-de-corpse-5-15/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Our fires raged at one end of Westmore.\\xa0 A full quarter of the city aflame.\\xa0 Though the wood used to grow portions of buildings and plant matter grown to seal the gaps between stones had been treated to make it less combustible, it was still wood.</p>\\n<p>Stitched, buildings, chemicals, it took so little for the Academy\\u2019s work to go up in flames.</p>\\n<p>The smoke billowed, but the walls meant it didn\\u2019t have many places to go.\\xa0 We were boxed in with mountains, cliffs, and walls, and that concentrated the smoke that hung lower to the ground.\\xa0 The rain pounded down on the burning buildings, creating a dull roar.</p>\\n<p>It was attention-grabbing.\\xa0 Enough to concern the forces at the battlefront.</p>\\n<p>We couldn\\u2019t see, but with the smoke, our enemy couldn\\u2019t see either.</p>\\n<p>We found the best hiding place we were able, listening as best as we could for the tramp of boots, then moved as soon as we heard the noise receding.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to communicate, reach out to the others and make sure we were on the same page, when it came to strategy and more.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t counted on being struck dumb.\\xa0 I\\u2019d wanted to make sure that I was the one who was stuck in the bed, while Gordon and Mary were free to act.\\xa0 Being injured wasn\\u2019t necessary, but I\\u2019d needed to sell it, and that meant blood and making my performance as real as possible.\\xa0 Opening an old injury was better than making another.</p>\\n<p>If I\\u2019d known I would have lost the ability to communicate, I would have gone another route.</p>\\n<p>I was scared in a way I usually wasn\\u2019t.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t able to use my senses to their fullest.\\xa0 With my eyes as screwed up as they were, and the chaos of noise in the background, the only things I could be sure about were things within thirty feet of me.\\xa0 The smoke hampered our enemy, but that didn\\u2019t do much good if we took the wrong turn or path between buildings and ended up face to face with a plague man and his exorcist.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t help that I wasn\\u2019t sure how the other Lambs were doing.\\xa0 Had I been able to take in more of the situation, I might have been able to reassure myself that the enemy lines hadn\\u2019t advanced far enough, or that there were avenues for them to escape.\\xa0 As it was, we scurried here and there, keeping our heads down, straining every sense, hoping that the combined senses of the three of us were enough to alert us to possible danger.</p>\\n<p>We stopped for breath, and to get our bearings.\\xa0 Gordon was doing the listening for trouble.\\xa0 I stayed beside him, while Mary stood a short distance away.</p>\\n<p>She knocked on the wall once.\\xa0 Not entirely necessary, given the broken window, but I imagined she was looking for her own unique sorts of reassurance.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and I listened, hard.\\xa0 There were no footsteps, no boots.\\xa0 Nothing close enough to be differentiated from the roar of background noise, of guns firing and rain pouring down on a spreading sea of fire that was stubbornly refusing to go out.</p>\\n<p>He knocked.</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s foot splashed in a puddle as she rejoined us.\\xa0 Her hand fumbled for and touched my shoulder.\\xa0 I squeezed Gordon\\u2019s upper arm.</p>\\n<p>We bolted.\\xa0 There was a soft \\u2018woof\\u2019 sound as the incendiary weapon went off.</p>\\n<p>A shout, directly ahead.\\xa0 Footsteps.</p>\\n<p>Gordon didn\\u2019t slow.\\xa0 I knew he had to have heard.</p>\\n<p>We made it another ten feet before he jerked us in one direction.\\xa0 We ducked in behind a solid metal object.\\xa0 I kept my head down, shoulders hunched, providing as small of a profile as was possible.</p>\\n<p>The men who ran past us weren\\u2019t plague men, but they wore the darker colors of rebellion members.\\xa0 They made their way into the opaque wall of rain and smoke, feet splashing.</p>\\n<p>We remained still until we couldn\\u2019t hear them.\\xa0 Mary coughed lightly.</p>\\n<p>The smoke was catching up to us.\\xa0 Soon it would drown us out.\\xa0 My world shrank from thirty feet to twenty, or perhaps fifteen.\\xa0 Anything beyond was indecipherable.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to tell them we needed to move faster.\\xa0 We had to get to a point that we could observe the situation, so we could find and reunite with the others, or get a grasp of any obstacles in our way.\\xa0 If we took too long and the city was drowned in smoke and fire, we might have to chance running across a warzone and risk taking a bullet, to get to the lodge where the others were.</p>\\n<p>At least the distraction was diverting enemy forces.\\xa0 The sound of gunfire had abated.\\xa0 They would have probably planned to get further into Westmore before their advance slowed and stopped.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t have a place to retreat to, and they no longer had any certainty that they would have shelter if this dragged out.\\xa0 The tent with the doctor and the stitched had no doubt been intended to be such a waypoint.</p>\\n<p>No place for the wounded to go, no place to sleep, to eat, nowhere to retreat.</p>\\n<p>They weren\\u2019t fearless.\\xa0 Humans had basic needs, and the plague men <em>were</em> human.\\xa0 In attacking their assuredness that they would be able to sustain those needs, we knocked the legs out from under them.\\xa0 Uncertainty, doubt, morale, all would turn to our advantage.</p>\\n<p>I just wished mine wasn\\u2019t suffering so much.</p>\\n<p>We stopped.\\xa0 The gunfire was closer, now.\\xa0 Running blind for a minute or less might see us running straight into harm\\u2019s way, now.\\xa0 Out of the alleyway and into the street.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m out,\\u201d Mary said, under her breath.</p>\\n<p>I was already out.\\xa0 I hadn\\u2019t grabbed many, and in my hurry to make sure my hands were free if I needed them, I\\u2019d used them quickly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have two.\\xa0 Want to hold on to one, just in case,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He headed to the nearest window we could make out.\\xa0 Mary and I moved a little further down.</p>\\n<p>I could hear him open the window.\\xa0 Mary and I listened.</p>\\n<p>It was harder, with the fighting being so close.\\xa0 There were people tramping this way and that in between nearby buildings.\\xa0 Plague men looking for vantage points.</p>\\n<p>We were in serious danger of being caught.\\xa0 I could only hope that we could pretend to be scared children.</p>\\n<p>Harder with Gordon than with any of us.\\xa0 He already looked like someone in his early-teens.\\xa0 He\\u2019d grown early and fast.\\xa0 Almost to the point where someone might have thought he should be in uniform with a gun in his hands.</p>\\n<p>Gordon knocked.</p>\\n<p>We carried on listening.\\xa0 I was pretty sure we were thinking along the same lines.\\xa0 That, being as close to the fighting as we were, we wanted to be extra careful.</p>\\n<p>She had hold of my hand, and was squeezing it, hard.</p>\\n<p>Mary prided herself so much on perfectionism.\\xa0 To be hampered, <em>damaged</em>, a sense failing her, unable to be her best, it probably knocked her legs out from her, like the fire had been intended to do for the enemy forces.</p>\\n<p>No sound.</p>\\n<p>We knocked.</p>\\n<p>A third knock sounded, just a short distance away.\\xa0 Not Gordon.\\xa0 The sound had an effect on me, as if all the cold outside of me was suddenly sucked into my bones, making everything come to a standstill.\\xa0 The fear that made a rabbit stand stock still as a fox came into sight.</p>\\n<p>I let go of Mary\\u2019s hand and drew my gun.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia\\u2019s gas, is it?\\u201d Melancholy asked.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s pistol fired.\\xa0 Mine was a second late, slowed by my concern that we\\u2019d draw attention.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBlind?\\u201d Melancholy crooned, not seeming to care.</p>\\n<p>I was in the midst of reloading, but Gordon had already reloaded, and fired again.</p>\\n<p>I held my fire.\\xa0 She wouldn\\u2019t have been taunting us like this if we had a chance of hitting her.\\xa0 I kept my gun in both hands, holding it firmly, so it couldn\\u2019t be taken away, and waited for an opportunity.</p>\\n<p>Mary was right beside me.\\xa0 Mud sucked at her boot as she shifted her stance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll-\\u201d Melancholy started.\\xa0 Gordon fired again.</p>\\n<p>He made a grunting sound, and I heard a wet slap as he landed full-on in the mud.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t make another sound.\\xa0 Mary did, beside me, but it was shock, a muted gasp.</p>\\n<p>The bone-deep chill I felt was a different sort from fear, this time.\\xa0 There was a very good chance this was a moment that would be engraved into my memory for the rest of my life.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t break my focus.\\xa0 I stared into a morass of smoke and rain, and saw absolutely nothing I could use.\\xa0 There were only the smudged shapes of buildings, a hundred shifting blurs of light and dark that could have been Melancholy and could have been nothing at all.</p>\\n<p>I heard a mechanical click.\\xa0 I aimed, but I didn\\u2019t fire.\\xa0 I heard the sound of boots on mud, quick.</p>\\n<p>Like Choleric had been, she had good reflexes.\\xa0 She was agile.</p>\\n<p>She could see us, while we couldn\\u2019t see her, and she had Gordon\\u2019s gun.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s try this again, minus interruptions,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She was around the corner, if I was gauging right, \\u201cI\\u2019ll make you a deal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I couldn\\u2019t respond.\\xa0 Well, I might have been able to, but it would have been a mouse\\u2019s strangled squeak.\\xa0 Drowned out by the noise around us.</p>\\n<p>I reached out with a foot and kicked Mary\\u2019s ankle lightly, once.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re listening,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to know where Phlegmatic and Choleric are.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s doable,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not done.\\xa0 I\\u2019m taking one of you hostage.\\xa0 The little one, messy black hair.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I offered another kick.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe says yes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy doesn\\u2019t he speak for himself?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe can\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Sylvester.\\xa0 Throw out the gun, straight in front of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was around the corner and to my left.\\xa0 She wanted to see the gun fall.</p>\\n<p>I tossed it out for her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGirl.\\xa0 You too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary hesitated a little bit longer before doing the same.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow, be good,\\u201d Melancholy said.</p>\\n<p>I reached out and kicked Mary\\u2019s ankle again.</p>\\n<p>She kicked me back, hard.</p>\\n<p>Then she did it again.</p>\\n<p>I twisted, reaching out, trying to stop her, but I felt her arm move.</p>\\n<p>She was fighting back.</p>\\n<p><em>Stupid, aggressive, single-minded Mary, no!\\xa0 </em>There was nothing I could do to stop her that wouldn\\u2019t potentially get us both killed.\\xa0 I pulled my arms away, backing up so I was flat against the wall.</p>\\n<p>Mary grunted, moving, hurling knives.\\xa0 Weapons that were utterly silent in use.</p>\\n<p>Melancholy was the one to make a small sound this time.\\xa0 A grunt of pain, a grunt of frustration?</p>\\n<p>Mary moved forward, following up the throws with an attack, slashing, feet slapping mud.</p>\\n<p>Then there was silence.</p>\\n<p>Mary remained in place shuffled, turning left, then right.\\xa0 Searching.\\xa0 I could make out her outstretched arms, the weapons held within.</p>\\n<p>Not throwing knives, but knives meant for close-quarters fighting.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d lost Melancholy.</p>\\n<p>There was a splash further down the alleyway.</p>\\n<p>Running, back toward the fires?\\xa0 I strained my senses.</p>\\n<p>Then a larger splash.\\xa0 At the corner of the buildings, between where Mary and I stood.</p>\\n<p>Enough of an impact that I knew it was Melancholy.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d gone <em>up</em>.\\xa0 Onto the roof.\\xa0 Hanging on, or standing on it.\\xa0 She\\u2019d thrown something to distract, and now she was between us.</p>\\n<p>The fight between the two was brief, impossible for me to follow.\\xa0 I could have fumbled in the mud for my gun, could have thrown myself into the fray in the hopes of grabbing Melancholy and hampering her enough for Mary to get a good hit in.</p>\\n<p>I remained where I was, against the wall, eyes closed, to better hear what was happening.</p>\\n<p>I heard a yelp, and the noises of fighting and feet skidding in mud stopped.\\xa0 My nose and mouth were choked with the smoke from the fires, not that I could smell anything with the acrid gas lingering in my nostrils, and my eyes were useless for making out anything that wasn\\u2019t in arm\\u2019s reach.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd then there was one,\\u201d Melancholy said, her voice soft.</p>\\n<p>Again, that chill.</p>\\n<p><em>Mary</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you need help?\\u201d a man asked, behind me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou three get back to the stablehouse at the corner.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve diverted too many people to combat the fires, we need to make sure we don\\u2019t lose ground,\\u201d Melancholy said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve got this well in hand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Plague men.</p>\\n<p>I hadn\\u2019t even heard them.\\xa0 Well, I heard them leave, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d say it felt unfair,\\u201d Melancholy said, \\u201cBut you already killed one of my partners, and I have to guess about the fate of the other.\\xa0 If your girl there had been five years older and capable of seeing, it might have been a fair fight.\\xa0 Little bitch still caught me once.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t offer her any tells, beyond my attempt to swallow that was a little more forceful than I\\u2019d expected.</p>\\n<p>A hand seized my throat.\\xa0 She hauled me up, choking me further, and held me up with my legs dangling, through a combination of strength and the force with which she pinned me to the wall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you know what their real plan was for us?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>She paused, as if she expected an answer.\\xa0 Had I not screamed myself mute, I still wouldn\\u2019t have been able to say anything, with the grip she had on my throat.</p>\\n<p>I grabbed her arm for support, as if I could alleviate the pressure.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFour of us.\\xa0 Bastards kept giving us missions.\\xa0 Even when one of us weren\\u2019t in full working order, or when we were feeling the hurt from recent surgeries.\\xa0 Do this, find this person, kill them.\\xa0 Bring us the body.\\xa0 Again and again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I sputtered out a breath, but it was a breath out, not in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey told us if we failed too many times, or if we got recalcitrant, then they would move on to phase two.\\xa0 Take us, butcher us, and keep the best pieces of each.\\xa0 My nose, Phlegm\\u2019s ears, Cholera\\u2019s body, \\u2018Guin\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 As for brain, well, that\\u2019s how they tried to set us against each other.\\xa0 Telling us that the most obedient, the one most willing to turn on the others-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I made a high, strangled sound, trying to breathe.\\xa0 I kicked in her general direction, but her other hand swatted my foot aside, and held it at an awkward angle, so my lower body twisted to the left, my left leg blocked by the firmly held right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou get the picture,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cDid they do the same with you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could have, <em>should have</em> said yes.\\xa0 Built a rapport.</p>\\n<p>I shook my head, as much as I was able.\\xa0 My neck muscles were as tight as bands of steel.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh well,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I opened my mouth, as if I were speaking.</p>\\n<p>She let go of my leg and gripped the front of my raincoat and shirt.\\xa0 She shifted her grip from my throat, allowing me to suck in smoke-filled air, and held my by the collar instead.</p>\\n<p>I tried to form words, pushing them out, but they came across as squeaks.\\xa0 The gunfighting had died down for now, it seemed, and even with less noise coming from that, I was barely audible.</p>\\n<p>She drew her ear closer, until it almost touched my mouth.</p>\\n<p>I could have bitten it.\\xa0 Seized a vulnerable piece of her in my teeth and held on as if it was all that mattered.</p>\\n<p>But what came after that?\\xa0 It would have been a waste.\\xa0 A final, bitter gesture before she killed me.</p>\\n<p>Not that she planned to keep me alive.</p>\\n<p>I spoke, and it was as if I were putting in all the effort of screaming at the top of my lungs and getting only raw pain in my throat and barely formed sounds.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey pick one,\\u201d I managed.\\xa0 I coughed.\\xa0 The smoke was getting to me.\\xa0 \\u201cOne of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Only one of us, in the end.\\xa0 Possibly after another generation, though that\\u2019s looking less likely, the way things are going</em>.</p>\\n<p>I coughed some more.</p>\\n<p>She stared at me.\\xa0 Even with her face just a short distance away, hair draped over much of it, an oddly shaped nose and wide, razor-toothed mouth in the part I <em>could</em> see, I couldn\\u2019t see her all that well.</p>\\n<p>Had she killed Gordon and Mary?</p>\\n<p>If she had, we were too far from help to revive them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s something wrong with you,\\u201d she told me, her voice low, breath hot on my face.\\xa0 \\u201cThat you\\u2019d stay loyal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head, opened my mouth.</p>\\n<p>She dropped me before I could respond, seizing me by the throat again the moment my feet hit ground.\\xa0 She struck one of the hands that reached for her wrist.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know what you\\u2019d say if you had the chance,\\u201d she told me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re loyal to your friends, not to the Academy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stopped fighting, pausing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was the same,\\u201d she told me.</p>\\n<p>In our first meeting, she\\u2019d rebuked us for trying to draw parallels.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re really loyal, show it by cooperating,\\u201d she told me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be a hostage.\\xa0 Maybe if this goes smoothly, someone can get those two some help.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>So vague I could have <em>spit</em>.\\xa0 What had happened?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d she said, in a different tone, as an afterthought.\\xa0 Emphasizing that it was only a possibility.</p>\\n<p>I bowed my head.\\xa0 I nodded.</p>\\n<p>I felt a knife touch my throat, and I wondered if it was Mary\\u2019s.\\xa0 She had me hold out my hands while she bound them.\\xa0 She held the knife to my groin while using one hand to loosely tie my ankles.\\xa0 Keeping me from running or kicking.</p>\\n<p>We walked, leaving Gordon and Mary behind.\\xa0 Into oblivion and smoke.\\xa0 Past figures I couldn\\u2019t make out, shadowy and nebulous.\\xa0 Souls in the limbo between life and death.\\xa0 Some living but scarred and left largely dead inside.\\xa0 Some dead, but with lightning crackling beneath their skin.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have the firebombs your friend was holding on to,\\u201d she told me.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you or someone else try something clever, I burn the building with the Brigadier inside.\\xa0 Fuck orders.\\xa0 Your remaining friends can burn with him.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a bad way to go.\\xa0 One I reserve for people who\\u2019ve wronged me, understand?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>We passed through a cluster of people.</p>\\n<p>She stopped, and her wrist dug into my throat as I jerked to a stop, the blade tight against the side of my neck.\\xa0 I felt the sting of a shallow cut.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPaper,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>The man in front of her reached into a pocket and produced a pad.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPen.\\xa0 And hold onto that pad,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I heard the scratches of pen on paper.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave a stitched carry this to the Brigadier as a messenger.\\xa0 Have them count the people inside.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMa\\u2019am,\\u201d the plague man said.</p>\\n<p>The Academy forces were an army of monsters and dead men, commanded by people.</p>\\n<p>It was starting to feel like the rebellion was an army of men, commanded by monsters.</p>\\n<p>Of course, I had no idea who or what Cynthia was.\\xa0 Perhaps it was an unfair assertion.</p>\\n<p>We waited in the rain, Melancholy with rain streaming down over wet hair, while I had my raincoat on.\\xa0 I was the one shivering, while her hand remained steady.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe said he\\u2019s open to discussion,\\u201d someone in the crowd said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich stitched\\u2019dja send?\\u201d Melancholy asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWill he answer my questions about their numbers?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe should.\\xa0 His handler told him to stand down.\\xa0 But stitched are stitched, you know?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Melancholy said.</p>\\n<p>She poked me in the back, bidding me to move.\\xa0 We walked together, her knife to my throat.</p>\\n<p>I could tell from the way she moved against my back that she was favoring a leg.</p>\\n<p><em>Good girl, Mary</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>Well, redact that.\\xa0 The attack had been reckless.\\xa0 I could understand the reasoning behind it, that Melancholy had only needed one hostage, she wouldn\\u2019t simply let the rest of us go, but it had been reckless.</p>\\n<p>But Mary had got our assassin once, at least.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou.\\xa0 Were there people inside?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was a stitched\\u2019s voice.\\xa0 \\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow many adults?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChildren?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThink.\\xa0 Children.\\xa0 This age, give or take.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree.\\xa0 Four.\\xa0 Three?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExplain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne\\u2026 between.\\xa0 Older.\\xa0 Girl.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDescribe her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThin.\\xa0 Girl.\\xa0 White hair.\\xa0 Or blonde hair.\\xa0 Glasses.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Shipman.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright.\\xa0 Good man,\\u201d Melancholy told the stitched.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t know who that one is, but I don\\u2019t care about them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We walked up stairs.\\xa0 I recognized them as the stairs to the Brigadier\\u2019s Lodge.\\xa0 I saw people on either side, using the building for cover, and took them to be the Academy\\u2019s.\\xa0 Westmore forces, with their brighter jackets.</p>\\n<p>There\\u2019d been a bit of a stalemate.\\xa0 The Academy forces <em>had</em> regrouped.\\xa0 They\\u2019d decided this was as good a defensive position as any to draw the line and decide they had to stop retreating.</p>\\n<p>But for the situation to be as it stood\\u2026 something had happened.\\xa0 Perhaps this had been too hard a position to attack.\\xa0 They couldn\\u2019t move on without resolving it, couldn\\u2019t attack it without undue losses.</p>\\n<p>Complicated by\\u2026 what had she said?\\xa0 Orders.\\xa0 Killing the Brigadier had been off-limits.</p>\\n<p>Melancholy kicked the door three times.\\xa0 It was ajar.\\xa0 \\u201cComing in!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She strode into the room, me in front of her.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t that effective a shield, but it hardly mattered.\\xa0 She had security of another sort.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrigadier.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d I heard a voice.\\xa0 Lillian\\u2019s, perhaps.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019d be one of the assassins,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTea?\\u201d the Brigadier asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not that stupid.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She wasn\\u2019t budging from the doorway.\\xa0 We were standing in the coat room.\\xa0 The part of the lodge past the midway point was raised a bit, and the other Lambs, Shipman, and the Brigadier\\u2019s people were gathered on that part, watching.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou want to discuss options?\\u201d the Brigadier asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve lost,\\u201d Melancholy said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI noticed the fires.\\xa0 Didn\\u2019t seem like the wisest thing to do,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy young colleagues here think it wasn\\u2019t wanted, on your part.\\xa0 You want to secure this building because it should be far enough from the fire.\\xa0 A defensive position you can fall back to.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve been put in an awkward position.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot my concern,\\u201d Melancholy said.\\xa0 \\u201cI only have the ability to give orders so I can secure you and your top officers.\\xa0 The army is someone else\\u2019s to lead, and the state of Westmore is that someone else\\u2019s concern.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia, her name was?\\u201d the Brigadier asked.</p>\\n<p>Melancholy nodded the affirmative.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you surrender and order your men here to put up no fight, you\\u2019ll all be given safe passage.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll be treated as prisoners of war and afforded every respect.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see.\\xa0 I-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBefore you accept.\\xa0 There\\u2019s another term.\\xa0 You give over the children to me.\\xa0 They die.\\xa0 Payment for me losing mine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her grip on my throat tightened, the blade stinging my throat.\\xa0 It was less painful, which was a bad sign.\\xa0 Less painful meant a deeper cut.\\xa0 The pain came later than it did with a shallow one.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere were two with him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCrippled, bleeding, left to burn.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could see the shadow of the man\\u2019s head moving.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSeize the children,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>My head bowed.\\xa0 There were shouts of protest, but Gordon and Mary were the fighters, and they weren\\u2019t .\\xa0 They were dealing with military men of some experience.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI gave you your chance,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0\\xa0 \\u201cI hope you understand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I leaned forward, not caring about the knife, I screwed up my face, and I spit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have to do what makes the most sense,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHmf,\\u201d Melancholy made a sound.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you for being cooperative.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d Jamie called out.\\xa0 \\u201cYou-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He stopped as Melancholy shoved me.\\xa0 I sprawled, landing on the floor.\\xa0 The Lambs were in front of me.</p>\\n<p>I flipped over, because I didn\\u2019t want to see them as Melancholy killed me.</p>\\n<p>She stood there, arms stretched out to either side.</p>\\n<p>I blinked.</p>\\n<p>I blinked again, trying to clear my vision.</p>\\n<p>Melancholy had a passenger.\\xa0 Clinging to her back, was a blonde girl.\\xa0 Helen.</p>\\n<p>I turned, looking at the crowd of people.</p>\\n<p>Sure enough, there were three figures who were the right size to be Lambs, and there was one who was definitely Shipman, all with soldiers behind them.</p>\\n<p>But\\u2026 yes.\\xa0 One was the Brigadier\\u2019s stitched servant.\\xa0 The firetender.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d noticed the stitched doing a headcount.</p>\\n<p>The perils of an expendable soldier.</p>\\n<p>Melancholy stood as if crucified, or as a bird in flight might appear, her arms gripped, twisted, and pulled back.\\xa0 Helen perched on her, feet finding purchase in the small of the assassin\\u2019s back.</p>\\n<p>The assassin shifted her footing.\\xa0 Slowly, but with surety, she contorted, body twisting, head turning as well, to a greater extent.\\xa0 She drew her mouth open, and even my ruined eyes could see the whites of her teeth.\\xa0 Opening wide, as she drew ever nearer to Helen\\u2019s face, a bear trap ready to take the front of Helen\\u2019s head off.\\xa0 Helen pulled away, contorting in her own fashion, but she couldn\\u2019t do more without releasing the assassin.</p>\\n<p>The others couldn\\u2019t shoot without the risk that a bullet might pass through Melancholy and catch Helen.</p>\\n<p>I stood.\\xa0 Going by memory more than sight, the mental image I\\u2019d cobbled together as Melancholy and I walked, I went for the woman\\u2019s left leg.</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s wound.\\xa0 I found it.</p>\\n<p>I dug the fingers of both hands into the gap, then wrenched it open.</p>\\n<p>Melancholy snarled.</p>\\n<p>Arms still outstretched, she bent forward, snapping for <em>me</em>.\\xa0 A viper\\u2019s movement, compared to the glacially slow contortion as she\\u2019d gone for Helen.</p>\\n<p>Helen moved, shifting grip, adjusting her own weight, throwing herself to one side.</p>\\n<p>I heard the snap, the pop, the cartilage and bone grinding.</p>\\n<p>Melancholy\\u2019s face, blurred, stretched into something hideous in the moment before she crashed to the ground.\\xa0 She writhed for a moment, solely with her upper body, before she gave up the last gasp.</p>\\n<p>Vertebrae separated, if I had to guess.</p>\\n<p>Helen remained there, holding Melancholy\\u2019s arms.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHello, Sy!\\u201d she said, brightly.</p>\\n<p>I opened my mouth to respond, then closed it.</p>\\n<p>There was a commotion as the others came.\\xa0 Lillian was quick to hurry to my side.</p>\\n<p>Everyone, be they the Brigadier or my fellow Lambs, was quick to throw a dozen questions each at me.</p>\\n<p>I touched my throat, looking at who I hoped was Lillian.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn it,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cNeed my bag.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Too much to communicate, too little time.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Mary hurt and bleeding out, with enemy forces between us and them.\\xa0 The location surrounded, the city overtaken by armies and fire, and Melancholy\\u2019s orders had been the only thing keeping the enemy from assaulting the Lodge.\\xa0 Now she was dead.</p>\\n<p>The moment they realized that, we were done for.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/09/05/enemy-arc-5/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>\\u201cTurn your face up,\\u201d Lillian told me.</p>\\n<p>I did.</p>\\n<p>She rinsed out my eyes with something.\\xa0 Liquid streamed down past my temples and ears and the back of my neck.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBlink, lots.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I did.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not helping.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep blinking,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I did.\\xa0 Gradually, the world became clearer.</p>\\n<p>I gave her a thumbs up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet me know when blinking stops working,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to focus on Gordon and Mary,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe <em>need</em> to win this,\\u201d one of the men who\\u2019d been with the Brigadier spoke, \\u201cWe\\u2019re being overrun.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m pretty sure the plague men are immune to poisons, parasites, and diseases,\\u201d I said, still blinking.\\xa0 \\u201cThey have the firepower to gun down your monsters, and they\\u2019re zealous.\\xa0 Stitched are falling faster than they should, and your specialists, rank-and-file and officers are getting intimidated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t news.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaking sure everyone knows what\\u2019s what.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019ve been doing, cooped up in here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWaging a war.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd being overrun,\\u201d I echoed him.</p>\\n<p>It was the Brigadier who stepped in to speak.\\xa0 \\u201cI have to ask.\\xa0 Was it you who set the fires?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I lied.\\xa0 \\u201cThey happened.\\xa0 We used them once they began.\\xa0 Spread them further.\\xa0 We felt it was important to divert them, make sure they didn\\u2019t have safe ground to fall back to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt was a judgment call on our part, seeing how and where they were moving.\\xa0 I understand if you don\\u2019t want to work with me any further.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could make out the individual slats of the boards in the arching ceiling, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we have any other choice,\\u201d the Brigadier said, and there was a curious tone to his voice, as if he\\u2019d caught me in the lie, and he was hinting he had, while trying to keep his men from grasping that fact.</p>\\n<p>I gestured at Lillian, and she rinsed my eyes again.</p>\\n<p>This time, as I blinked, I lowered my head, looking around.</p>\\n<p>Helen was sitting on the edge of the table with the maps, close to the fireplace, her feet in Jamie\\u2019s lap.\\xa0 Shipman was sitting at the far end of the table.\\xa0 The men were all standing.</p>\\n<p>I wiped at my eyes and temples with my hands, then ran my fingers through my wet hair to get the worst of the cleansing agent out.</p>\\n<p>I looked down at Melancholy.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou opened your wound again,\\u201d Lillian noted.</p>\\n<p>I looked down at my side.\\xa0 The cold rain had washed away a surprising amount of the blood.\\xa0 There were traces, though, a blob of pinker fabric.</p>\\n<p>I pulled my raincoat closed.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re surrounded, on the defensive, we have two key people who need immediate attention, and if they find out Melancholy here is dead, then her orders to keep certain individuals alive stop holding water.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My attention turned momentarily to the Brigadier as I hopped down from the edge of his desk and walked over to Melancholy\\u2019s body.\\xa0 One of the commanding officers was standing over it, another was at the window, peering out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve summed it up,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need solutions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was being more curt than before.\\xa0 Had we disappointed?\\xa0 Or was something else bothering him?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThinking,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBelieve me, I know we need solutions.\\xa0 Two people I care about dearly are out there, and I don\\u2019t know if they\\u2019re alive or dead.\\xa0 The sooner we can get to them, the better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I rifled through Melancholy\\u2019s pockets, patting her down.\\xa0 Everything I pulled out found its way to the floor.\\xa0 Three rings that might have been wedding bands, except they were the wrong metal, threads, buttons, two torn patches with what looked to be cloth badges on them, two photographs, of all things, badly exposed, showing very normal people.\\xa0 There were also things I expected: a pen, a flask of alcohol, two knives, a tube of something that smelled foul, and three pieces of paper.\\xa0 The firebombs she\\u2019d taken from Gordon were on her belt.</p>\\n<p>The mementos caught me off guard.\\xa0 This was a person with keepsakes and history.\\xa0 People she kept photos of, both men.</p>\\n<p>I took the belt of firebombs, unbuckling it, and collected the pieces of paper, along with Melancholy\\u2019s pen.</p>\\n<p>After a moment\\u2019s hesitation, I grabbed one of the three rings.\\xa0 Steel, dark, but it had been polished bright where it had been rubbed.\\xa0 It was a hair too large on my finger, so I moved it to my thumb.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-the fireplace?\\u201d Helen was asking.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been slightly out of earshot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUp the fireplace.\\xa0 Escape route.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPossibly.\\xa0 There are no guarantees you won\\u2019t be shot when you pop out the top, or that you have any place to go if you aren\\u2019t shot,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 He gauged the size of the chimney.\\xa0 \\u201cYou children could squeeze through, but your escape route doesn\\u2019t help any of the rest of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen\\u2019s face was devoid of compassion as she took in that sentence and continued to stare at him.\\xa0 He looked away first.</p>\\n<p>I slapped the papers down in front of Jamie.\\xa0 Helen craned her head around to look at it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019re these?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLetters in Melancholy\\u2019s possession.\\xa0 Her handwriting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He groaned a little, head bowing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can try,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExplain,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 His men were looking more antsy, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cForgery,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe have some of Melancholy\\u2019s handwriting.\\xa0 Someone in their leadership.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot wrong with that idea,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>Still so negative.\\xa0 Still curt.\\xa0 He was <em>upset</em>.\\xa0 It felt disconnected from the idea that he was losing this battle.\\xa0 If it had been connected, he would\\u2019ve been more vocal during some parts of the conversation thus far, and less vocal during other parts.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat am I writing?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrigadier Tylor, sir,\\u201d I said, choosing the full title to try and curry favor with the man.\\xa0 \\u201cYou get to be Melancholy.\\xa0 She\\u2019s not the direct leader, but she\\u2019s next best thing, and she\\u2019s in the field, here.\\xa0 Her orders supercede most others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t order a retreat.\\xa0 They wouldn\\u2019t believe it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cProbably not,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUnless-\\u201d Lillian started.</p>\\n<p>Heads turned, and she fell silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo on,\\u201d I urged her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSuperweapon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWestmore doesn\\u2019t have a superweapon,\\u201d one of the officers said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey have to know it doesn\\u2019t.\\xa0 They controlled the city for a long period of time.\\xa0 They interrogated captives, kept prisoners.\\xa0 I imagine they tortured and drugged those prisoners.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded slowly.\\xa0 \\u201cOrdering a retreat <em>and </em>claiming we have a mysterious superweapon is pushing it.\\xa0 Jamie.\\xa0 First order.\\xa0 Written to the vanguard, the front line.\\xa0 Furthest up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would be the northwestern point,\\u201d the Brigadier commented.\\xa0 One of the commanders nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGeorgie Madsen,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cProbably.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo for it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow do you know that?\\u201d Shipman asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThat it\\u2019s him?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI read a lot of the correspondence and paperwork that passed over the enemy\\u2019s desk, while I was babysitting Ames,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He was already writing.\\xa0 \\u201cMadsen is the best fit.\\xa0 Young officer, eager, aggressive.\\xa0 Had a wife, they were expecting, his wife lost the baby.\\xa0 He blames the drug for the loss, and now the sterility throws a wry stitch into things, because they can\\u2019t try again.\\xa0 He\\u2019s angry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not how it works,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe drug.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t matter, because it matters to him, and it gives him a reason to push to be at the front,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOfficer Madsen gets a letter from Melancholy.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a superweapon in the mines, with caches of weapons.\\xa0 Leave a skeleton crew to man the front, other units are coming to reinforce his position shortly, get to the mine shaft by that one gate-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSoutheastern gate,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave him send some people down.\\xa0 Even if the superweapon is a hoax, the cache is almost a certainty.\\xa0 Paranoia on the Crown\\u2019s part, after the near-shortage before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTying them up,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded with vigor.</p>\\n<p>I was anxious.\\xa0 I wanted to be gone, and this maneuver wouldn\\u2019t be fast.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSecond letter,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWest gate.\\xa0 They have to be there,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey want an escape route with the fires burning behind them, they don\\u2019t want to pass us and then get attacked from behind.\\xa0 It\\u2019s the only logical point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCombat fires in the southwestern position,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMadsen\\u2019s group is secure at the northwest and is being reinforced as we speak.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The brigadier nodded.\\xa0 Jamie nodded too.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThird note.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can only write so much at once,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo the command here.\\xa0 To be passed on to their superior officers.\\xa0 Melancholy has finished with her task here.\\xa0 She has Tylor.\\xa0 Send two coaches, have two men collect the injured children at\\u2026 damn it.\\xa0 We were close to here.\\xa0 Within earshot to hear people shouting about the firefight here.\\xa0 Plague men came directly at us from\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich direction, Sy?\\u201d Jamie asked, voice soft.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBetween the last fires we set and, it had to be a bend in the road, the way foot traffic was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHereabouts?\\u201d Jamie asked, pointing at the map.</p>\\n<p>I looked, trying to gauge.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThereabouts,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe and the children are to be brought back here and put in the coaches.\\xa0 Prisoners of war, and children of important figures.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s almost a bigger stretch than \\u2018the rebellion forces should collectively retreat,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cAlmost.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOur safety was guaranteed in exchange for information about the weapons in the mine,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey may not buy it,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cThese missives coming from here?\\xa0 Having us escorted into the coaches with the assassin remaining behind, unseen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have an idea,\\u201d I said, while still pontificating on what that idea entailed.</p>\\n<p>Jamie wrote with Melancholy\\u2019s pen.\\xa0 He passed the first paper to me, immediately starting on the second.</p>\\n<p>The handwriting matched perfectly.\\xa0 There were individual letters that weren\\u2019t in any of her notes, but there were the florid, angular capital letters, even the way the crisp handwriting got messier for words further down the page, as if she\\u2019d lost patience with the neat handwriting style and started scribbling out the words instead.\\xa0 A habit in both of the papers I\\u2019d given Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep in mind,\\u201d I said, \\u201cIf her handwriting gets gradually sloppier, that\\u2019s going to carry over across the three messages.\\xa0 If they check it, we don\\u2019t want that little oddity to raise alarm bells.\\xa0 Prey instinct.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Without looking up, Jamie crumpled up the paper he was writing on and started on a second.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is not a strength of mine, Sy.\\xa0 I haven\\u2019t practiced it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo your best,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHelen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen beamed a smile at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re Melancholy, for our little task here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWow,\\u201d she said, smiling wider.\\xa0 \\u201cHow does that work?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, for one thing, we can be glad her hair covers so much of her face,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll need a knife.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not sure I understand,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou will,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cKnife?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He hesitated.</p>\\n<p>Still that aura of negativity.\\xa0 Doubt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease, sir.\\xa0 We\\u2019re short on time.\\xa0 Even if for your own preservation, we can\\u2019t have Melancholy\\u2019s meeting with you extend too long.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man lifted a foot, and pulled a combat knife from the side of his boot.\\xa0 He extended it handle-first.</p>\\n<p>I took it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian trotted to catch up with Helen and I.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou want to cut off her hair?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI figure it\\u2019s easier to maintain her hairstyle if we just take it all in one go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian blanched a little.</p>\\n<p>I smiled at her.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat?\\xa0 You\\u2019ve poisoned people.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve seen people die.\\xa0 This is cake.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen made an amused little sound.\\xa0 I handed her the knife, and she bent down.</p>\\n<p>She proceeded to scalp our assassin, knife following the hairline.</p>\\n<p>In the doing, she revealed Melancholy\\u2019s eyes.\\xa0 A little milky in color, with sockets that looked too splayed out, the ridges of cheekbone and brow too accented.\\xa0 She might have looked skeletal, but it was more that her skeleton was an odd shape.\\xa0 Her jawline, too, was strange.\\xa0 Akin to a snake\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>Something about it, the large eyes, the disproportionate features, the odd shape of her head, minus half of her scalp, it made me think of a newborn baby.\\xa0 Blind, orally focused, agape, face twisted in emotion she wouldn\\u2019t be able to express again.</p>\\n<p>Hadn\\u2019t she said something about how we were all brought into the world?</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d been more focused on the relationships than on the fact that we came into the world bloody and powerless, though.</p>\\n<p>I rotated the ring around my thumb with one finger as I looked down at her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBloody,\\u201d Helen observed.\\xa0 \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t do if I had blood running down my face.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRinse it,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian, use some powder or something, get the bleeding to stop.\\xa0 Then makeup.\\xa0 This is your chance to shine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat makes you think I have makeup?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been wearing some.\\xa0 You were wearing it at the school the last time I saw you there.\\xa0 I know you have <em>something</em> to cover up bruises and cuts.\\xa0 Unless you were a twit and used it all up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian sighed, exasperated.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re a real charmer, Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know you\\u2019re not a twit, Lil,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI just really want to help Gordon and Mary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cMe too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We were pulling it all together.\\xa0 There was just one thing we needed.</p>\\n<p>I looked at the fireplace tender, and I felt a moment of doubt.</p>\\n<p>No.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShipman,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She looked a little wary as she turned her full attention to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy do I have a bad feeling about this?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re learning,\\u201d Jamie murmured, still writing.\\xa0 He\\u2019d scrapped two drafts since Helen started scalping.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need legs for our new Melancholy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was a bad joke in stage plays, one child atop another\\u2019s shoulders, trying to be an adult.\\xa0 But Melancholy had a heavy black raincoat, and Helen was an actress.\\xa0 She already wore Melancholy\\u2019s scalp.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019ve got a hump,\\u201d I observed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen contorted, shifting position.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cPressure, ow, pressure!\\u201d Shipman raised her voice a little.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShh!\\u201d I hissed.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can damn well cope.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe\\u2019s digging individual toes in between my ribs for a foothold.\\xa0 I\\u2019m allowed to say it hurts!\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBring your knees in,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The bits poking out beneath the armpit receded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBetter,\\u201d Shipman said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDon\\u2019t care,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cToo tall,\\u201d Jamie observed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen dropped her height an inch.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cToo short,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen raised her head a half-inch.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Exemplary control over her own body.\\xa0 Not perfect, but enough to make the difference.\\xa0 To sell this in a way that wouldn\\u2019t normally work.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou need the mouth,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t have the teeth, and I can\\u2019t do the voice,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cUnless you want to get a file?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIbott would kill us,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t talk, don\\u2019t open your mouth.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Then she pulled at muscles in her face.\\xa0 A rictus grin, too-wide, until it looked like her mouth would tear open.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It wasn\\u2019t perfect.\\xa0 The nose was wrong.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But people didn\\u2019t look at noses.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOfficers, Brigadier,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cKneel.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I could tell the instruction didn\\u2019t go over well.\\xa0 These weren\\u2019t men who had knelt for anyone but the Crown.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I got a kind of perverse joy out of it, watching as they knelt.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIn a line,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat pissed-off look on your faces?\\xa0 Keep it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">They arranged their positions, so they were all in a line, down the center of the room.\\xa0 Jamie, Lillian, and the firetender took up position just in front of them.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u2018Melancholy\\u2019 and I approached the door.\\xa0 Shipman was slow, carrying Helen.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t complain any further, though.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGood girl,\\u201d Helen purred.\\xa0 \\u201cKeep going.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t need the encouragement,\\u201d Shipman said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cPat on the head for you,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I opened the door a little, caught it with my foot, and then kicked it open, trying to make it look more like \\u2018Melancholy\\u2019 had opened it than I had.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She stood in the doorway, so the door remained propped open, and I threw myself forward, stumbling to the point of nearly falling down the stairs.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The people on the street were far enough away they\\u2019d infer I\\u2019d been pushed or kicked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I looked at the Academy forces at the walls on either side, defending the position, ready to open fire.\\xa0 I moved my head as if I was looking past everyone and everything, blind.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSoldiers?\\xa0 If you\\u2019re there, throw down your guns,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I could see them hesitate.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat\\u2019s an order!\\xa0 Throw them down!\\u201d Tylor bellowed, from inside.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">As I walked down the stairs, I could hear the guns being dropped to the ground.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">That sound and the presence of Melancholy in the doorway lent me an air of legitimacy.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I stumbled down the stairs, missing the occasional step, and trying to step down to another step when I reached a short landing.\\xa0 I made my way down to the street.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSomeone in charge?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThe assassin sent me.\\xa0 Someone?\\xa0 Anyone?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The mail was snatched out of my hands.\\xa0 A plague man had it.\\xa0 He had pocks and boils breaking up tattoos on his neck and hands, military tattoos.\\xa0 The sort that almost counted as medals people gave themselves, or to memorialize the dead.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Don\\u2019t read it.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t read the others\\u2019 letters.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat are these?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe said, um, one for you, and then one for Madsen, and one for the forces at the west gate.\\xa0 Orders from the top.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The man made a face.\\xa0 I saw only through my peripheral vision, as my \\u2018blind\\u2019 gaze stared a hole through his chest.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He didn\\u2019t like Melancholy, I realized.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Funny how it worked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIs she coming down to join the rest of us?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI only- I was told to bring the letters.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t see what\\u2019s going on,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He opened one of the letters, then hunched over.\\xa0 \\u201cDamn rain.\\xa0 Ink\\u2019s running.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I remained silent.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe senior officers are being taken as prisoners of war,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He turned his head.\\xa0 \\u201cTwo coaches.\\xa0 We\\u2019re going to be rid of the ugly bitch, and not a moment too soon.\\xa0 Send runners with these letters to Madsen and Hughey.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Gordon and Mary</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He wasn\\u2019t giving the order to go and find them.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The simple, stupid reality of humans.\\xa0 There was only so much they could process.\\xa0 We\\u2019d given them too much information to dwell on.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He\\u2019d completely glossed over that part.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">If I said anything else, it put everything in jeopardy.\\xa0 Gave them cause to be suspicious, to pay attention to me, the lowly messenger\\u2026</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I swallowed hard.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Had to take the risk.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMy friends,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey were with me, and she hurt them.\\xa0 She said, Tylor made her promise to help them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I stared at the ground as I said it.\\xa0 Hoping, hoping.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMm,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 A single syllable response.\\xa0 Not even a <em>word</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I had a knife and I had a firebomb.\\xa0 If it came down to it, I\\u2019d stab him and make a break for it, using fire to delay pursuers.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I wasn\\u2019t sure what I\\u2019d do at that point, but I couldn\\u2019t do nothing.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Come on.\\xa0 Basic sense.\\xa0 You can\\u2019t go against her deal with Tylor, or you jeopardize everything</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cVic.\\xa0 Head over in the direction of the bank.\\xa0 Opposite end of the street, behind the houses.\\xa0 If the fires aren\\u2019t too bad.\\xa0 Bring someone to help carry.\\xa0 Supposed to be two injured kids.\\xa0 Related to bigwig doctors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I sagged in relief.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Relief or no, I didn\\u2019t say or do anything to draw attention to myself.\\xa0 The rain poured down, battering the paper the plague man held gripped in his fist.\\xa0 Gunshots and explosions sounded off to the north end of the city.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The fighting had stopped here, but the war hadn\\u2019t left the area.\\xa0 The air smelled like smoke and blood, and there were more people staring off into space than there were people talking.\\xa0 Everyone in their own individual worlds.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I could remember seeing that look in the plague men\\u2019s eyes back in the city.\\xa0 A part of them missing, perhaps.\\xa0 Was it a casualty of the transformation, or of previous battles?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">What did it mean, to be so changed?\\xa0 They\\u2019d become the perfect soldiers for this ugly battlefield, but it was a change that made it awfully hard to go home, when all was said and done.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I\\u2019d talked about the importance of the fact that these people <em>wanted</em> to fight.\\xa0 They wanted justice and revenge.\\xa0 The Academy forces didn\\u2019t want either.\\xa0 They wanted to return to their ordinary lives.\\xa0 It made a difference, when push came to shove.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Was there a chance that these men who had been made into soldiers would want to keep fighting, when ordinary, sane people would want the war to end?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We\\u2019d never identified the doctor responsible for creating these transformations.\\xa0 He was likely to be elsewhere, making more.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">An awful lot of men with little to look forward to, except the expectation of death and blood.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I stood and waited in the rain, shivering, until the coaches arrived.\\xa0 Two men perched on the back, each holding on with one hand, their other hands wrapped around Gordon and Mary, respectively.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary\\u2019s eyes were open, and her expression changed as she saw me.\\xa0 Gordon was moving, but very weakly.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I allowed myself to feel relief, finally, but I didn\\u2019t let it show.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Three commanding officers, the Brigadier, and all of the Lambs found their way into the coaches, hands and ankles bound.\\xa0 Two plague men rode up top of each coach, and another was inside the cab of one of the other coaches, but there was room on the bench.\\xa0 I was the last one into the crowded space of the first coach\\u2019s interior.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Well, not the last one.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Melancholy made her way down the stairs.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t stare, instead turning away as she drew ever nearer, but I imagined the challenge.\\xa0 Shipman, not the largest of us, but sixteen nonetheless, with a burden on her back and shoulders, walking down wet stairs.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">One stumble, one fall, and the ruse was ended.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I reached out for Mary\\u2019s hair, and stroked it, pushing it out of the way of her face.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She smiled at me, her eyes half-lidded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was a slight collision as \\u2018Melancholy\\u2019 reached the door.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re not riding up top?\\u201d the plague man who\\u2019d taken the letter asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She couldn\\u2019t talk, not without revealing her voice, or the fact that her teeth were normal.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Instead, she chanced a look in his direction, giving him a better view of her face.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A sneer of contempt.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She lurched into the cab of the coach.\\xa0 The door slammed behind her.\\xa0 The other coach\\u2019s door slammed as well.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I didn\\u2019t dare breathe, my ears peeled for any sign that they\\u2019d realized or started to doubt matters.\\xa0 That they were angry and would start an argument.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The door was closed, and all was silent, but for Gordon\\u2019s labored breathing.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Were we free and clear?</p>\\n<p>My heart pounded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The coach set to moving.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Free and clear.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We stopped at a fork in the road.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The able-bodied officers of the Academy\\u2019s forces hauled the plague men out of the vehicle, leaving them at the side of the road.\\xa0 Even with many of us being children, we\\u2019d had the weight of numbers in a cramped space.\\xa0 After that, the ones up top had been caught and either strangled or shot.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I watched how Jamie stared down at the bodies.\\xa0 But we had other things to focus on.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou know the way?\\u201d I asked the Brigadier.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOf course.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie spoke, not taking his eyes off the dead plague men, \\u201cBack around the side roads, up to the north end of Westmore.\\xa0 You can appear at the rear of our own forces, and lead them with knowledge of what the enemy is likely doing.\\xa0 Their forces will have been pulled back from the front.\\xa0 You can flank and destroy, then use the momentum.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOr command a retreat,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I raised my eyebrows in surprise.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI haven\\u2019t decided,\\u201d he admitted.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ll see.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think Westmore is salvageable.\\xa0 But it may not be for them, either.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was a pause.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Nothing more to be said, except-</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He extended a hand.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Again, my eyebrows went up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou made the best of a bad situation,\\u201d he told me.\\xa0 About the best compliment I could get, given the circumstances.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I took his hand and shook it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019ll be going now,\\u201d he said, moving over to the other coach, which was already slightly turned to the northernmost road in the fork.\\xa0 \\u201cLost time is life spent.\\xa0 Especially in wartime.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt won\\u2019t always be,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He gave me a sad half-smile.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI really believe it won\\u2019t be,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat there won\\u2019t be war, or that we\\u2019ll one day have time to spare?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIs there an answer I can give that will make you stop giving me that pitying, condescending look?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 Then I remembered, \\u201cSir?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGood luck,\\u201d he said, with a kind of finality.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The words were on the tip of my tongue.\\xa0 I wanted to ask, but I didn\\u2019t dare.\\xa0 Yet I knew that having no answer would bother me for a long time.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Why were you upset that we rescued you?</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou too,\\u201d was all I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I climbed into the other coach.\\xa0 An officer rode on top, wearing a plague man\\u2019s hat ad coat.\\xa0 He was the only one not going with the Brigadier, and he kicked things into motion.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I settled in next to Mary, and let my hand rest on her forehead.\\xa0 She was a little too warm.\\xa0 Opposite me, Gordon had his head in Shipman\\u2019s lap, feet on Jamie\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWas just tellin\\u2019 the others,\\u201d she said, sleepily.\\xa0 \\u201cOur misadventures.\\xa0 Wish we\\u2019d done better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe did pretty well, circumstances allowing,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ll wrap this up neatly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf that sniper who shot you doesn\\u2019t get us,\\u201d she mumbled.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I looked up, in the direction of the coach driver.\\xa0 My finger rotated the ring at my thumb.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019ll be fine.\\xa0 Flying enemy colors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSure,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIs this really how we want to operate?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHm?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cKilling those who show mercy and heal us, abusing the terms of surrender, wearing enemy colors?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd hair!\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 She was at Mary\\u2019s feet, the hair in her lap.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201c<em>Yeah</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI mean, isn\\u2019t it?\\xa0 We do what we have to, to make this work.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know where you\\u2019d draw the lines, otherwise.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI think you know where the line is, Sy,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think you deliberately choose to cross it.\\xa0 Sometimes when you don\\u2019t have to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI like that side of him,\\u201d Mary said, sleepy, thoroughly under the effects of the painkillers. \\u201cI like Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI like him too,\\u201d Jamie said, voice firm, \\u201cBut I think you\\u2019re a bad influence on him.\\xa0 You and Gordon both.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary snorted.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI mean it.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know that I like what Sy becomes, when he\\u2019s with you two.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m not that suggestible,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou are the <em>exemplar</em> of suggestibility,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s your strongest trait.\\xa0 You absorb and you learn more effectively than any of us.\\xa0 I know because I know exactly what\\u2019s happened in the past.\\xa0 I know who you\\u2019re with when your behavior changes.\\xa0 I see the patterns.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUsing my suggestion against me?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 I\\u2019d told him to watch for trends.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cTo your benefit, Sy,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot against you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The rest of the coach was so very quiet.\\xa0 Everyone was hanging on to every word, and nobody was jumping in, to defend me, or in the case of Gordon or Mary, to defend themselves.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cSo I\\u2019m just a composite of influences around me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are definitely things that make you

it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd, as I\\u2019m reminded with the plan to off the rebellion doctor, your insistence on attacking the people who are kindest to you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I shrugged.\\xa0 I\\u2019d deflected the last two comments, but I felt like I couldn\\u2019t with this one, without being dismissive of the weight it seemed to carry with Jamie.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He was too gentle a soul.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m suggestible, like you said,\\u201d I said, eyes on Jamie\\u2019s knees.\\xa0 \\u201cMy oldest memories are of days and weeks of people consoling me, telling me it\\u2019s going to be fine.\\xa0 I\\u2019m so brave, I\\u2019m so kind.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll give me things.\\xa0 I just have to stop crying, stop struggling, stop making trouble.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I raised my hands, gesturing, \\u201cKindness, then unbearable

I\\u2019m done with that.\\xa0 I know what lies beneath the surface.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary, head still in my lap, reached up and gave my arm a rub.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian\\u2019s eyes were shiny.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Shipman, in stark contrast, looked like she wanted to be far, far away from here.\\xa0 Her attention was outside the window.\\xa0 Even with Gordon\\u2019s head in her lap, she didn\\u2019t look like she was connected or present at all.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Their relationship was over.\\xa0 I knew it.\\xa0 The war, or Gordon\\u2019s actions, or the danger, something had driven a wedge.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBut <em>we\\u2019re</em> kind to you, Sy,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cAren\\u2019t we?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou are,\\u201d I said, without hesitation.\\xa0 \\u201cBut-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I\\u2019d started speaking again, somehow in the expectation that someone would jump in and finish the sentence for me.\\xa0 Then I realized I didn\\u2019t want them to.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBut?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBut we aren\\u2019t <em>people</em>?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat\\u2019s not what I meant.\\xa0 It sounds wrong, like it\\u2019s being twisted around to mean the opposite of what it means.\\xa0 You\\u2019re\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I floundered.\\xa0 It was a rare thing for me.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re<em> better</em> than people?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">My heart was cold in my chest.\\xa0 I felt like I\\u2019d somehow stumbled on the worst combination of words to say, and I\\u2019d put <em>everything</em> in jeopardy.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Nobody was talking.\\xa0 Body language was <em>weird</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie rose from his seat.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He crossed to my side, then nudged for me to move over.\\xa0 Mary and I did a little bit of reshuffling to make room.\\xa0 Even so, he was a touch squeezed between me and the door.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cDo that more,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCompliment you?\\xa0 Talk about your superiority?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBe upfront.\\xa0 Say what <em>Sy</em> is thinking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was no way to say anything to that.\\xa0 It would have felt forced.\\xa0 I was left mute, only able to nod.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He elbowed me, then turned his attention to Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cDidn\\u2019t make you too uncomfortable?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNope,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He reached over and began fixing her hair, pushing it out of her face.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou going to be good to go?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019ve fixed what I could, but breaks are breaks,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo hard exertion.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m good to go,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He worked his way to a sitting position, making use of the space Jamie had vacated to move his legs.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">His hand was trembling.\\xa0 Phantom pains, again?\\xa0 It shouldn\\u2019t have been so soon.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m not very fast, but I can help,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">It was cozy, squeezed up against Jamie, Mary\\u2019s head in my lap, the others around me.\\xa0 I almost could have fallen asleep.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But as I looked out the window, I could see Whitney.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I reached out past Jamie\\u2019s face and knocked on the glass.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The coach slowed, then stopped.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We slowly made our way out of the coach, many of us hurt, offering help where we could.\\xa0 Only Shipman remained behind, with the driver.\\xa0 She avoided our gaze.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We had a job to finish.\\xa0 Westmore was a wash.\\xa0 Even if our forces won every fight that followed, it would be chalked off as a loss.\\xa0 A detriment to the Crown.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">But the rebellion wasn\\u2019t in a position to commit halfheartedly, and Cynthia hadn\\u2019t been in or around the tents where I\\u2019d been brought for treatment.\\xa0 She was still in Whitney.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Vulnerable.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Barely illuminated by the rising sun, we made our way down toward the city.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/08/27/esprit-de-corpse-5-13/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>As organized as Westmore had been at the start of the evening, things were devolving.\\xa0 The warbeasts were out of their cages, and every time they set foot on an area that wasn\\u2019t roadway, they left the ground torn up.\\xa0 Those areas soon became cesspits of mud.\\xa0 Stitched were gathered, but there was less rhyme and reason than before.\\xa0 Rank and file in hooded jackets, steaming in the rain, guns in hand.\\xa0 Weapons were being rolled into place, and officers were having to work harder to enforce discipline.</p>\\n<p>It was too late in the evening.\\xa0 People wanted sleep, and in the absence of sleep they were smoking or sitting down at their posts \\u2013 more in the posts off on the side gates and the little buildings that were housing supplies than at the gate and along the streets.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, Mary and I chose our route to be unpredictable, weaving and winding, aiming to get a view of the areas where assassins might lurk.\\xa0 Now and then, Gordon would walk off a short distance and kick at a fallen set of planks or a bit of cloth, to identify anything hiding beneath.\\xa0 The three of us had guns in holsters, our coats on, not so dissimilar from the stitched in appearance, though we were almost half the size.\\xa0 I was less than half the size, myself.</p>\\n<p>We passed a set of doors, and Mary did the bending-down, touching the small rigging of sticks and wire under the first door.\\xa0 A motion of her hand indicated that it was fine.\\xa0 We passed to the second door.\\xa0 No issue.</p>\\n<p>At the third, she gave the flat-handed gesture for negation.</p>\\n<p>I gripped the handle of my gun.</p>\\n<p>Gordon snapped his fingers to get Mary\\u2019s attention, then gestured at the side of the building.\\xa0 She and I trained our guns on the door while Gordon walked around to the side, found a way to half-climb up the building, and peered into the little window.</p>\\n<p>As he dropped to the ground, with only the smallest splash, he drew his own gun, hurrying to join us.</p>\\n<p>Meaning there was something to be concerned about.</p>\\n<p>I stepped to the side of the door, back to the wall, hand on the knob, other hand holding my revolver.\\xa0 My eyes scanned the short street we were on, looking for trouble.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary were poised.</p>\\n<p>I turned the knob.\\xa0 They rushed the room, while I covered their rear.</p>\\n<p>Tense seconds passed, with no gunfire.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon murmured.</p>\\n<p>I entered the building.</p>\\n<p>A man was slumped on the floor.\\xa0 He was snoring softly.\\xa0 \\u2018Man\\u2019 might have been too generous.\\xa0 Older than fifteen, younger than twenty, with only a ghost of a beard and mustache.</p>\\n<p>Mary bent down and picked up the little twist of wire and branch.\\xa0 \\u2018L\\u2019 shaped, not much longer than any of my fingers, it was small enough to go unnoticed, but if a door was opened, the little twist of wire would get moved across the floor.\\xa0 If we couldn\\u2019t find it, someone had been inside since the last time we passed through.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRest well, soldier,\\u201d Gordon murmured.</p>\\n<p>Mary sniffed.</p>\\n<p>We shut the door gently behind us.\\xa0 Mary bent down to put the twist of wire back into place.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was that noise you made?\\u201d I asked, my voice soft enough it was almost drowned out by the march of boots on the road a street over.\\xa0 Forty or fifty people, probably stitched from the noise they were making.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNoise?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAfter Gordon\\u2019s \\u2018rest well\\u2019?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh.\\xa0 Doesn\\u2019t matter.\\xa0 I kind of wanted to kick him in the ass and yell at him,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat kind of behavior makes me antsy.\\xa0 Knackering off when there\\u2019s a battle to be fought.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t know his story,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat might be driving him, what happened earlier in his day.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s sleeping while there\\u2019s a battle to be fought,\\u201d Mary said, again.\\xa0 \\u201cEveryone is tired and anxious.\\xa0 Why does he get to sleep?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe found a way,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf he gets caught, he faces the consequences.\\xa0 If he doesn\\u2019t, he gets to sleep.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRules are in place for a reason,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>This time <em>I</em> snorted a little.</p>\\n<p>Gordon bent down to check the next door.\\xa0 \\u201cTalk to Sy about that one.\\xa0 He could talk your ear off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut seriously,\\u201d Gordon said. \\u201cI agree with him.\\xa0 Sometimes the only good a rule does is weed out the people who can\\u2019t figure out a way around it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like how I\\u2019m being dragged into this conversation, and I\\u2019ve barely said anything,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat person\\u2019s presence in the next fight might be the factor that makes or breaks our victory,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cHis being well rested might make or break it, too.\\xa0 Or it might give him a chance to stand out.\\xa0 Be a little bit sharper.\\xa0 I\\u2019d rather have clever people who know how to break the rules in charge, over people who\\u2019ve only ever done as they were told.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause those clever people would be in charge of people trying to take shortcuts and skip out on work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd that\\u2019s why we love you, Mary,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s deflecting,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re trying to distract me by throwing the word \\u2018love\\u2019 out there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure, but I\\u2019m not deflecting so much as I\\u2019m trying to take the reins of the conversation and get it away from a debate that\\u2019s never going to end.\\xa0 Gordon\\u2019s on one side, he prefers the fastest, most expedient\\xa0 method of getting results, and we\\u2019ve got you on the other, striving toward perfection and order.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou could be the tiebreaker,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cSettle it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re an ass,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d he asked, and he actually managed to <em>almost</em> sound innocent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBreak the tie,\\u201d Mary said, before I could voice a response.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t about to let it go, now.</p>\\n<p><em>That</em> was why Gordon was an ass.\\xa0 Mary had a way of obsessing or fixating, and it got worse when she was tired.\\xa0 Something about the way she\\u2019d been raised, the very minor changes Percy had made to her brain as she developed, it made it so she could and would keep practicing or training or studying when someone else would be too exhausted to keep going.\\xa0 It was possible for her to push her own limits to the point where she damaged her own body.\\xa0 It was even <em>likely</em>, if the people around her weren\\u2019t careful to keep an eye on her or set strict rules.</p>\\n<p>I stepped ahead a bit to bend down, my stomach still sore, using the excuse of checking the wire under the door to try and delay having to give an answer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I could imagine Gordon\\u2019s smile, in the shadows of his hood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou win,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToo easy,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t believe you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFine.\\xa0 Gordon\\u2019s right.\\xa0 Better to let the guy keep sleeping.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon snorted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGive me a real answer,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>The rumble of gunfire in the distance saved me.\\xa0 Our heads turned, and then we were off, running, boots splashing in muddy water.</p>\\n<p>The gunfire was different from before.\\xa0 The last attack had been the \\u2018handshake\\u2019.\\xa0 Feeling us out.\\xa0 Tentative, bullets spitting and spraying here and there, an already-injured beast unleashed to see how fast it died, and to show them that we were confident enough to sacrifice it.</p>\\n<p>This was a swelling.\\xa0 Answering one exchange with something bigger and louder.</p>\\n<p>Off the side street, onto the main.\\xa0 A long-haired warbeast with horns bigger than I was saw our movement out of the corner of its eye and turned its head in our direction, snapping.\\xa0 Gordon stumbled, with the speed and amount he had to duck the swinging horn.\\xa0 Mary ducked a little.\\xa0 I was happy to let the horn pass over my head.</p>\\n<p>The specialist in charge of the thing rebuked it, provoking a drawn out and guttural moan from the thing, but it was well behind us by then.</p>\\n<p>We reached the wall.\\xa0 I held up my badge without breaking stride.</p>\\n<p>Within one second of my stepping on the stairs to go up to the higher portion of the wall, an explosion rocked the area, and I ended up slamming my shin against the third stair.</p>\\n<p>Gordon grabbed me and unceremoniously hauled me to my feet, holding me by the back of my pants until I had my feet under me and was keeping up.</p>\\n<p>The area was lighting up.\\xa0 Bioelectric lamps were on, shedding light on the battlefield, but liquids were leaking out as stray bullets caught them, and they were of the sort that flickered a lot, even left alone.\\xa0 It was unreliable lighting.</p>\\n<p>The enemy was here.\\xa0 It looked like a lot of them.\\xa0 Maybe every able bodied person in Whitney and many who weren\\u2019t able bodied, all camped out on the road, far enough back that our bullets wouldn\\u2019t reach them, and vice versa.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d been right.\\xa0 This was the full-frontal attack.</p>\\n<p>Problem was, this was a situation the Lambs weren\\u2019t suited for.</p>\\n<p>If we were still in the enemy camp, it would be a different story.\\xa0 We\\u2019d handled the strategy, informed the commander.\\xa0 Our only hope was to gather information or hope they made a mistake we could exploit.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t even try to talk, with the noise around us.\\xa0 One of the warbeasts was getting agitated by the sound of the battle it wasn\\u2019t being allowed to join, and I wondered if it hadn\\u2019t been injected with stimulants; perhaps a chemical to help an already pain-tolerant, bullet-resistant creature of war cover the distance between us and them.</p>\\n<p>I gestured instead.\\xa0 Open hand to fist.\\xa0 Fist tapped to chest.\\xa0 Two finger flick gesture toward the other side of the wall.</p>\\n<p>Want, claim, take, for the first gesture.\\xa0 Then me.\\xa0 Then over there, moderate distance.</p>\\n<p><em>I want to get over there.</em></p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a cool look, ducking his head below the rise of the short wall between us and them, but he didn\\u2019t gesture in response.</p>\\n<p>I knew it was dangerous and suicidal.\\xa0 But our only ability to truly control this situation depended on information.\\xa0 The Brigadier seemed set on attacking the enemy, and if we decided we needed to change that course, then we needed new details to bring to him.\\xa0 If we decided the attack was the right plan, then that information could only help.</p>\\n<p>If there was a chance we could figure out what they had up their sleeves in time to prepare our side, that could be the most important thing.</p>\\n<p>It all hinged on our ability to actually obtain that information.\\xa0 Simple observation wouldn\\u2019t do.\\xa0 The explosions and the vibration of one wall-mounted gun at the far end of the wall were making it hard to focus.</p>\\n<p>As Gordon and Mary had been tense and poised to attack as I\\u2019d prepared to open the door, I felt a sense of readiness <em>now</em>.\\xa0 One opportunity, one event, one clue.</p>\\n<p>A different sort of attack, this.\\xa0 On our end, at least.</p>\\n<p>They had stitched.\\xa0 So did we.\\xa0 Eight out of ten people at the top of the wall were stitched.\\xa0 Two specialists, a commanding officer, Mary and I were the only ones who weren\\u2019t.\\xa0 Gordon was a grey area.\\xa0 Forty or so stitched were shoulder to shoulder along the top of the broad stone gate.</p>\\n<p>Something roared, from their side.</p>\\n<p>That was a surprise.</p>\\n<p>A warbeast.\\xa0 I chanced a peek, and I saw it charging up the road.\\xa0 Not Academy material.\\xa0 Weaker and less refined than any of ours: slower, smaller, and uglier.\\xa0 Hornless, it more closely resembled a cross between a rhino and a naked mole rat.</p>\\n<p>Still, it had all of the right characteristics.\\xa0 Thick hide sufficient to stop most bullets, tons of raw muscle, hostility.</p>\\n<p>I realized I was holding my breath, seeing its approach.\\xa0 I could hear the specialists on the wall calling out orders to the stitched in their charge.</p>\\n<p>Bullets fired, targeting the thing.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t see in the gloom, not with all of the rain, but I saw its head jerk to one side as a black smudge opened around one eye.\\xa0 Blood.\\xa0 Blind in one eye?</p>\\n<p>It veered to one side as its head jerked \\u2013 it had a habit of running where it was facing, and then it self-corrected, not slowing down.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHold!\\u201d one of the specialists screamed.\\xa0 \\u201cHold!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The enemy wasn\\u2019t following up on the warbeast\\u2019s attack.\\xa0 Had they attacked with all of their massed forces and the beast, perhaps using a few other tricks, they would have forced us to either mow them down or kill the beast, either option giving them a shot at breaching the wall.</p>\\n<p>My mind turned over the options.\\xa0 Was it a leadership gambit?\\xa0 A promise made by Cynthia, to energize the forces, that the lives of the people of Whitney wouldn\\u2019t be thrown away?</p>\\n<p>Did she think she could win without sacrificing soldiers?</p>\\n<p>Or was there another explanation?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHold!\\u201d the specialist called out.</p>\\n<p>A bullet caught him.</p>\\n<p><em>The man with the eyes</em>, I realized, before ducking down.</p>\\n<p>Bullets weren\\u2019t clean.\\xa0 They weren\\u2019t tidy.\\xa0 The shot had struck him in the upper chest.\\xa0 Too high for the heart or lungs, I thought, but he dropped, letting his gun fall, hands to the wound as blood poured out.</p>\\n<p>He was trying to speak, calling out.</p>\\n<p>When he failed to get the words out, he raised his hand, pausing, making awful choking sounds, aiming to be heard by the other specialist on the wall-</p>\\n<p>Another bullet struck the upraised hand.\\xa0 Two fingers were ruined, left hanging by trace amounts of skin and muscle, the shocking white of bone exposed.</p>\\n<p>Mary raised her head.\\xa0 I grabbed her with both hands to try to haul her down, but she raised herself up with more confidence, rather than less.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s on the cliff!\\u201d she called out, raising her voice.\\xa0 \\u201cHe just changed locations!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I raised my own head up to look, trying to see the cliff.</p>\\n<p>The specialist dog with the ruined hand let it drop.\\xa0 The other specialist was too busy giving orders to reload to pay him full attention.</p>\\n<p><em>Not enough human brains on this wall</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNow!\\u201d Gordon hollered.\\xa0 He\\u2019d been watching the scene unfold, had a sense of the timing.</p>\\n<p>Stitched lobbed small objects over the wall.\\xa0 Grenades or bombs.</p>\\n<p>The warbeast was closing on the wall.\\xa0 It got within fifty feet, then forty, then thirty-</p>\\n<p>The grenades and other devices went off.\\xa0 Detonations kicked up mud and moisture, and the other devices erupted in collections of flame that danced over the water\\u2019s surface instead of being extinguished by it.</p>\\n<p>The thing\\u2019s course was altered.\\xa0 As before, it turned its head to one side, perhaps trying to protect the one remaining eye, and it lost virtually all of its momentum.\\xa0 It walked through fire without seeming to care overmuch.\\xa0 Some of the flames crept up its feet and legs.</p>\\n<p>It slammed its head into the front gate.\\xa0 The entire wall vibrated.\\xa0 One elephantine warbeast, and it hadn\\u2019t even had a full charge backing it.</p>\\n<p>The specialist dog who\\u2019d missed the intent of his partner was giving orders, bidding the stitched to rain down guns</p>\\n<p>More explosives and accelerants were dropped down on top of it, a steady, constant rain, more aimed toward the thing\\u2019s rear than it\\u2019s front, to avoid damage to the door.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHold off!\\u201d the commander called out.\\xa0 \\u201cGuns only!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The specialist relayed the order to the stitched.</p>\\n<p>I must have had a confused expression on my face, because Gordon leaned close, raising his voice to be heard, even though he was right in my ear.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re opening the gate.\\xa0 Our warbeasts against theirs!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Why did I feel like that was exactly what the enemy expected and wanted?</p>\\n<p>I rose to my feet, ducking low to keep my head out of the way of flying bullets.\\xa0 Down the stairs.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary came with me.</p>\\n<p>It was madness on the lower level.\\xa0 Sandbag emplacements were going up on the road, people and experiments were trying to navigate the spaces between.\\xa0 I made a beeline for the warbeasts, scanning the crowd.</p>\\n<p>With the volume of the noise and the amount of distractions, I had no choice.\\xa0 I grabbed the man who seemed to be talking to the warbeast handlers, as a smaller child might grab for their mother\\u2019s legs.</p>\\n<p>He turned his attention to me.\\xa0 One eye twitched, not because of me, but because of an explosion.\\xa0 Maybe a dud bomb that the beast had crushed underfoot.</p>\\n<p>The gate rattled as it swung its head into the iron-reinforced wood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTrap!\\u201d I called out.\\xa0 \\u201cThey want you to open the gates!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo choice!\\u201d the man said, with complete confidence.</p>\\n<p><em>That doesn\\u2019t mean this is the right decision.\\xa0 It just means they\\u2019ve maneuvered us into a corner</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBullets!\\u201d I said, still raising my voice to be heard.\\xa0 The rain was coming down harder, but it was like there was so much going on that the individual rain drops were being broken up into a harsh, downward spray.\\xa0 \\u201cBombs!\\xa0 That thing won\\u2019t get through the door!\\xa0 It\\u2019s small!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to do damage if we don\\u2019t put it down fast!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet it!\\u201d I called out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd the next time?\\xa0 The time after that?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p>The man shook his head, sweeping his arm out to push me out of the way.</p>\\n<p>I found my badge and held it up.</p>\\n<p>A stitched threw itself off the top of the gate, dropping to the ground between us and the door.\\xa0 It twitched and thrashed as it fought.\\xa0 I looked back, staring, while Gordon hurried over to the body.</p>\\n<p>I turned my attention back to the man, and saw him focusing on the badge.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s an order!\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He made a sound that might have been a laugh.\\xa0 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t give orders!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Frustration seized me.\\xa0 I had a distinct mental image of myself cutting him down right there, consequences be damned.</p>\\n<p>But the cost was too great.\\xa0 I\\u2019d lose other opportunities.</p>\\n<p>The gate rattled again.\\xa0 Headbutt after headbutt.\\xa0 But it wasn\\u2019t making significant progress.\\xa0 It would die before it did.</p>\\n<p>The commander was weighing things in terms of cost.\\xa0 The damage to the gate, the damage the enemy might do later in this fight, or in future ones.\\xa0 He was thinking about how many bullets and explosives we had, and how many we wouldn\\u2019t have, if we tried to gun this thing down.</p>\\n<p>I was thinking in terms of the enemy\\u2019s strategy.\\xa0 Their eerie confidence that this, right here, was a battle they could win.</p>\\n<p>This felt like step one of that battle plan of theirs.</p>\\n<p>I grabbed his jacket.\\xa0 He pushed me aside, turning to someone, giving an order while pointing at me.\\xa0\\xa0 I could barely hear over the ringing in my ears.</p>\\n<p>Gordon stepped up.\\xa0 He reached up and grabbed the man\\u2019s collar.\\xa0 One fierce tug, and the man bent over, almost tipping over face first onto the waterlogged road.</p>\\n<p>Mary stepped closer, a knife in hand, touching it to the man\\u2019s throat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cListen,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>While I desperately thought of a way to convey the sense of alarm I felt in a way he\\u2019d understand, men in our vicinity had drawn guns, with <em>us</em> now in their sights.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe took one of their creatures apart!\\u201d I told him, \\u201cIt was packed full of <em>gas</em>.\\xa0 Human sized experiment, could have killed a roomful of people!\\xa0 That thing could have enough gas in it to kill everyone at the gate and on the wall-top above it!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I watched, waited, stared at his eyes, and refused to betray the slightest bit of doubt.\\xa0 I had to convince him on every level.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight!\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He pulled himself back up to a standing position, one hand on Gordon\\u2019s shoulder, and both Gordon and Mary let him straighten up.</p>\\n<p>Mary and I backed off, stepping to the sidelines, where row and column of stitched stood waiting, shrouded in their black coats and hoods, guns in gloved hands.\\xa0 Gordon was still kneeling by the fallen stitched.</p>\\n<p>It was cold enough for my breath to fog in the air.\\xa0 The last traces of winter, joined by freezing rain.\\xa0 Whether we won or lost, there would be frost on the ground for the sun to melt, come morning.\\xa0 The world would keep turning.</p>\\n<p>The world didn\\u2019t feel like it was turning.\\xa0 The gate wasn\\u2019t opened, the warbeasts on our side weren\\u2019t sicced on the smaller one on <em>their</em> side.\\xa0 It was a slow wearing down of two very durable targets: the warbeast on their side and the door on ours.\\xa0 Two immovable objects.</p>\\n<p>Well, theirs could bleed, at the very least.</p>\\n<p>Our forces bled in their own way.\\xa0 A stitched stood, arms flailing, and then collapsed onto the surface at the top of the wall.\\xa0 Still thrashing, it rolled over the edge, dropping to the ground.\\xa0 Still alive, it moved too violently to be approached.\\xa0 They left it like that, struggling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBacking off!\\u201d the commander on the wall shouted.</p>\\n<p>I felt like Jamie, a step behind.\\xa0 It was an unfamiliar environment, my senses were overloaded.\\xa0 I belatedly realized what they were saying.</p>\\n<p>The enemy warbeast was retreating?</p>\\n<p>Surprisingly complex behavior for a creature to display on its own.\\xa0 To decide it was too hurt to keep going?\\xa0 That wasn\\u2019t the usual warbeast psychology.\\xa0 That was counterintuitive, if anything.\\xa0 Who wanted a warbeast that <em>ran</em>?</p>\\n<p>Inferior work?</p>\\n<p>Part of the plan?</p>\\n<p>Gordon straightened, running toward us, an object in his hand.\\xa0 The stitched he\\u2019d approached had died on hitting to the ground.\\xa0 Durable as they were, a snapped neck was a snapped neck.</p>\\n<p>When Gordon was halfway to us, he was knocked to the ground by a thunderclap of an explosion, trumping any we\\u2019d felt this night, with the exception of the one to hit the rooftop.</p>\\n<p>I saw and smelled smoke, billowing in from the gate.</p>\\n<p>A bomb.\\xa0 Had the warbeast been rigged?</p>\\n<p>No.\\xa0 I connected the dots, too late.</p>\\n<p>The warbeast wasn\\u2019t alone.\\xa0 It had been given instructions.</p>\\n<p>Sleight of hand.\\xa0 Distract someone with the flash, something impossible to ignore, and the other hand moved subtly at the scenes.</p>\\n<p>Someone or <em>something</em> had accompanied the warbeast.\\xa0 Inside it, under it, hiding on top, I couldn\\u2019t guess.\\xa0 That figure would have had to have hidden in the shadows at the very base of the wall, knowing that the rifleman with the bugged-out eyes was picking off anyone who raised their head too high or leaned too far over to look down.\\xa0 To work in concert, with that kind of trust, it had to be the woman with the teeth.\\xa0 The sniffing woman.\\xa0 <em>Melancholic.</em></p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d brought a bomb, something larger, she\\u2019d waited until the explosives and fire raining down from above had slowed in amount, ordered the warbeast back and out of the way-</p>\\n<p>Had the gate been open for our warbeasts to go through, she might have had her creature carry the bomb into our ranks, or planted the explosive further in, during the chaos, to make it a difficult or impossible to defend our wall.\\xa0 If we didn\\u2019t have the stairs up to the platform at the top, to shoot over and see what the enemy was doing\\u2026</p>\\n<p>As it was, her explosion had damaged the gate.</p>\\n<p>No, worse than that.</p>\\n<p>Her warbeast renewed its attack.</p>\\n<p>It struck the gate, and the gate did more than <em>rattle</em>.\\xa0 It <em>knocked</em>.\\xa0 Something was loose, banging against the frame.\\xa0 A second strike made a louder knock, with a creak marking something straining, falling out of place.</p>\\n<p><em>The explosion damaged the gate -enough-.</em></p>\\n<p>Enough that the warbeast could make headway.</p>\\n<p>That the people on our side couldn\\u2019t haul it open.</p>\\n<p>Enough that the enemy felt confident in mounting a proper attack.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRepair teams!\\u201d a commander called out.</p>\\n<p>Men and women with wood, metal, tools, oversized stitched with them to do the heaviest lifting and work.</p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d patch things up, but they needed room.</p>\\n<p>The warbeast charged, and the billowing smoke expanded out of the way, showing its head.\\xa0 It had rammed through loosened wood and planks, head sticking through the gate.</p>\\n<p>An order was given, one of our beasts, the energetic one, lunged.\\xa0 It gripped the enemy warbeast in its teeth, holding onto the thing\\u2019s head, twisting and wrenching.\\xa0 The struggle damaged the gate further, but the enemy warbeast quickly faltered, its skull being crushed at an agonizing rate.</p>\\n<p>Our beast won, tearing the enemy warbeast\\u2019s head free of its neck.\\xa0 The amount of blood was <em>astonishing</em>.</p>\\n<p>No gas, thankfully.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been wrong.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe shoot the gas canisters through, keep them at bay!\\xa0 Send the stitched in to do what they can!\\u201d the commander was saying.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen the gas dies down, step in to work and direct the stitched!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The repair crews gave their affirmative, but I could see the nervousness in their body language.\\xa0 The enemy could be marching on us now.\\xa0 More weapons, more beasts, more surprises.\\xa0 It was hard to say.</p>\\n<p>This was going poorly, but if we could get the wall repaired-</p>\\n<p>Cannons fired, aiming for the opening in our own gate.\\xa0 I could see the gas rise, higher than the wall on the other side.\\xa0 Something lethal, poisonous.</p>\\n<p>Our stitched approached the gate, ignoring the thinner streams of gas that filtered through the damaged parts.\\xa0 There were a lot of damaged parts.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBe ready!\\u201d the commander called.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they have stitched, they might try sending them through the gas!\\xa0 They won\\u2019t be commanded, so concentrate fire and be smart!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary reached out and clutched my sleeve.</p>\\n<p>Gunshots sounded, close, and from the other side of the wall.</p>\\n<p>A stitched laborer on our side dropped.</p>\\n<p>A bullet caught a non-stitched laborer on <em>our</em> side.</p>\\n<p>It was surprising, and the surprise accented the awfulness of it.\\xa0 The shock, the blood, the wrench of agony in the woman\\u2019s features.</p>\\n<p>More bullets came.\\xa0 Through the cloud of vapor and the rain, I could see the shadows of legs, people ducking low, the flash of rifles firing through the gaps.</p>\\n<p>Our side fired back.\\xa0 The enemy ducked out of the way.\\xa0 Grenades flew in through the gap, and when they exploded, they didn\\u2019t produce fire or explosion.</p>\\n<p>Gas.\\xa0 Like we\\u2019d deployed.</p>\\n<p>Smart stitched?</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s grip tightened.\\xa0 I grabbed her wrist, and grabbed Gordon\\u2019s sleeve.\\xa0 We backed away, taking cover.</p>\\n<p>It was the inverse of the situation the commander had mentioned.\\xa0 As we hurried to fight back, pulling warbeasts out of the way and trying to organize our stitched in the midst of the chaos, our stitched were left leaderless.\\xa0 The exorcist rifles did horrific damage.\\xa0 One or two shots to down each stitched.</p>\\n<p>As the gas crept closer to Mary and I, I pulled my shirt up around my nose.\\xa0 A sad measure, but the stuff hadn\\u2019t been aimed at us.\\xa0 It wouldn\\u2019t reach us, short of the wind changing direction.</p>\\n<p>The men strode out of the gas.\\xa0 One or two rubbed at rheumy eyes and scarred eyelids.\\xa0 A mild reaction for the danger the gas should have posed.</p>\\n<p>Plague men.</p>\\n<p>I was reminded of Mauer\\u2019s speech on the horrors of the battlefield.\\xa0 I realized what might have driven a soldier to subject themselves to that kind of ugliness.</p>\\n<p><em>They\\u2019ve made their elite soldiers immune to the plagues, poisons, and parasites the Academy might use against them.</em></p>\\n<p>They\\u2019d traded away the secret, but they\\u2019d seized the front gate in exchange.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/08/29/esprit-de-corpse-5-14/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The spot we\\u2019d chosen to hide ended up being one of the worst possible positions, short of actually standing in between the two forces.</p>\\n<p>Stones, planks, sandbags and barrels had been set down by the side of the road.\\xa0 We crouched there, using them for cover, while bullets flew.\\xa0 They smacked against the sandbags and stones intended for use in repairing the gate.\\xa0 Others struck the street and the dirt a matter of feet behind us, likely ricochets more than anything.</p>\\n<p>It was hard to see, with both sides using noxious smoke and gas.\\xa0 Both sides were fighting more or less blind, only a hundred or two hundred feet from each other.\\xa0 What my <em>ears</em> told me, however, when I strained to process what was out there behind the shouting and the report of gunfire, was that the plague men were silent, the only noise being the tramp of boots as they shifted position and took cover.\\xa0 Our side was doing the same, but they had to cede ground to the gas, sending the stitched on and forward.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIdiots,\\u201d Gordon said, right in my ear.\\xa0 He was closer to the end of the pile of supplies, nearer to our people than to the gate.\\xa0 I strained my eyes to see what he was seeing.</p>\\n<p>Whatever it was, I couldn\\u2019t make sense of it.\\xa0 As smoke swirled, I was only able to make out vague shapes, but the rote movements of the stitched and the fact that they didn\\u2019t move or reposition let me gradually put together a mental picture of what I was looking at.\\xa0 Stitched knelt behind sandbags, methodically reloading, aiming, firing, reloading, aiming, firing.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t flinch as the larger bullets of the plague men\\u2019s special guns put massive holes in sandbags inches from their heads.\\xa0 When one stitched died, the rest kept on working.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIdiots?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It seemed dumb to be raising my voice to be heard over the gunfire when we were supposed to be <em>hiding</em>, but there was no other way to manage, and I doubted we would be heard.</p>\\n<p>He shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cGave ground!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gave ground.</p>\\n<p>I could sort of see what he was thinking, now.\\xa0 The plague men were advancing, returning fire until the stitched weren\\u2019t shooting anymore, then moving up to take defensive positions.\\xa0 The stitched remained where they were, but they operated on simple rules and instructions.\\xa0 Face forward, shoot the enemy.\\xa0 They couldn\\u2019t improvise, and they didn\\u2019t have the basic creativity or problem solving ability to figure out less conventional defensive positions.\\xa0 They didn\\u2019t use the corners of buildings or the drop of porches, they didn\\u2019t realize when their cover was whittled away.</p>\\n<p>There were a lot of reasons stitched were a terrifying weapon in war.\\xa0 In this fight, they weren\\u2019t being wielded right.\\xa0 They were being deployed to the rows of sandbags that had been placed in the road.\\xa0 They weren\\u2019t lasting long at all.\\xa0 They went down thrashing.</p>\\n<p>While our side kept sending more into the clouds of gas with orders to take up the first available set of sandbags and open fire, convinced they were pushing the enemy back.</p>\\n<p>Doing the same thing over and over again.</p>\\n<p>Soon, the plague men would reach <em>our</em> cover, and there would be no chance of hiding.</p>\\n<p>There were two likely options for our side, now, provided they realized the mistake they were making.\\xa0 They could pull back, secure positions, maybe even burn buildings that the enemy could use, regroup and make a concerted effort to use the stitched as they were supposed to be used, durable shock troops.\\xa0 We had enough of them, but without the coordination we would lose more than we killed.</p>\\n<p>The second option was that our side might well release the warbeasts and other experiments.</p>\\n<p>I was really hoping they didn\\u2019t release the warbeasts.</p>\\n<p>An explosion in the vicinity of the gate nearly knocked me over.\\xa0 Blind gunfire touching the ground a bit behind me told me I could very well have died if I\\u2019d lost my balance and fallen.</p>\\n<p>Another explosion touched down.\\xa0 It said a lot that I wasn\\u2019t sure which side was using it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCareful!\\u201d Mary shouted.</p>\\n<p>The explosion had stirred clouds of gas.\\xa0 All three of us turned away from the blast, so our backs were to the wind and the onrushing gas, hoods pulled up.</p>\\n<p>I held my breath, even after the wind passed.\\xa0 I waited as long as I could, and when I could breathe again, I exhaled forcefully, for the little good it did.\\xa0 I kept one eye tightly closed and relied on the other, the knuckle of my thumb pressed to a nostril.\\xa0 Head down, moving as little as I had to, to keep my heart rate lower.</p>\\n<p>Standard precautions, when dealing with unknown toxins.</p>\\n<p>It was a mistake to be here, but the ebb and flow of the fight had moved faster than we\\u2019d been able.\\xa0 Now we were pinned down.\\xa0 There was nothing clever we could do to get out and away, because there were no <em>people</em> here.\\xa0 Nobody to manipulate, no tools to use, outside of sticks and stones.\\xa0 No place to run.</p>\\n<p>Horns sounded.\\xa0 Warbeasts roared.\\xa0 The ground shook.</p>\\n<p>My head was already bowed, hood pulled down, back hunched over.\\xa0 I was already in a pretty defeated posture.\\xa0 There weren\\u2019t any options for expressing my absolute dismay.</p>\\n<p>My nostrils and eyes were burning.\\xa0 When I blinked, my vision streaked, as if I were looking through a smudged window.</p>\\n<p>The rumbling of the ground intensified as the warbeasts drew closer.</p>\\n<p>I heard Gordon\\u2019s alarmed grunt, felt his shoulder touch me, and with no idea what to do, I let myself go limp, trying to fall so I was lying along the base of the stack of wood and stone.</p>\\n<p>The crushing impact was powerful enough that I was left momentarily breathless, and it wasn\\u2019t even a direct hit.\\xa0 I felt something collide with the construction supplies we were using for cover, and the power of the blow passed from the pile to the ground, and through me.</p>\\n<p>I looked up, and I saw the warbeast charging on, into the smoke and gas by the gate.\\xa0 Wood and stone flew through the air, some fragments clinging to the single horn that had struck the edge of the pile.</p>\\n<p>Our cover was mostly gone.</p>\\n<p>This wasn\\u2019t why I\\u2019d hated the idea of sending the warbeasts.\\xa0 This was a bonus.\\xa0 A crummy-ass bonus in a crummy-ass situation.</p>\\n<p>The problem was that they weren\\u2019t realizing the <em>problem</em>.</p>\\n<p>This wasn\\u2019t a dumb, thoughtless attack.\\xa0 We were fighting people who knew us, knew the tools the Academy had.\\xa0 Why the hell would they attack if they didn\\u2019t think they could deal with the warbeasts?</p>\\n<p>Near the gate, another of the rebellion\\u2019s warbeasts lunged out of the smoke.\\xa0 It collided with ours.</p>\\n<p>Two-thirds of the size, the rebellion warbeast was furless, thick-skinned, and functioned like a blunt weapon.\\xa0 A crude club, used for smashing.</p>\\n<p>Ours was thick skinned, but had thick fur at the head and shoulders, a bison\\u2019s mantle or a lion\\u2019s mane, massive, sweeping horns, and pirahna teeth.\\xa0 It could bite, bash, rend, slice, and it could likely do any of the four better than the smaller one could smash against things.\\xa0 Combine traits of the four, and it was a devastating work of art.</p>\\n<p>I wondered if the student who\\u2019d made it knew how carelessly it was being thrown away.</p>\\n<p>We had armored vehicles.\\xa0 Just as there were cars on the road, there were armored cars with guns mounted on them, and powerful engines.\\xa0 There were armies that had relied on them.</p>\\n<p>The problem was, warbeasts like these were built to last.\\xa0 They could take the gunfire offered by the armored cars, close the distance, and then there was nothing the armored car could do.\\xa0 One headbutt, and the car could be rolled.\\xa0 Claws could tear at doors or hatches, and powerful limbs could tear at guns.</p>\\n<p>That had led to a series of countermeasures and counter-countermeasures.\\xa0 Bait cars were rolled into the field, set to explode when a warbeast attempted to roll it.\\xa0 Warbeasts got smarter and tougher, or they got mass-produced.\\xa0 It was too expensive to make those bait-cars compared to how easy it was to grow the beasts.\\xa0 More inventive countermeasures had to be developed.</p>\\n<p>It was hard to wage a war when one side was forced to constantly outdo itself in being inventive and devious, and the other simply had to do the same thing they were doing, only a little bit better every time.\\xa0 Stronger, faster, tougher.</p>\\n<p>Plague men moved out of the noxious gas, the exorcists dangling from straps.\\xa0 They were holding other, smaller guns, spreading out and firing at our warbeast.</p>\\n<p>Two more of the Academy\\u2019s warbeasts joined the fray.\\xa0 One collided with the wall, claws scraping against stone.\\xa0 Another aimed for the plague men, who moved out of the way, too spread out for the beast to go after more than one or two at a time.\\xa0 With the gas blocking some of the view, I wasn\\u2019t sure if it was making any contact at all.</p>\\n<p>What had come first?\\xa0 Had they possessed the eerie calm and ability to focus wholly on this fight first, leading to them agreeing to be modified, or had the mental changes been part and parcel of it?</p>\\n<p>A combination of the two?</p>\\n<p>The rapid report of a higher-tech gun marked more bullets being fired.\\xa0 The warbeast closest to us twisted around a hundred and eighty degrees, switching the side that was exposed to the gunfire, and then reversed direction, unable to escape the hail of fire.</p>\\n<p>It roared and then abruptly charged with no provocation.\\xa0 It collided with the wall, to the left of the gate.\\xa0 I was pretty sure it had caught one of the plague men between its head and the stones.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t the smoke obscuring my view, but the blurriness in one eye.\\xa0 It was getting worse.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was reaching over me.\\xa0 I raised myself up out of the puddle at the base of our meager cover, to get a better look.</p>\\n<p>It was black, and it looked more like a crystal than anything, pointed at both ends, more akin to a needle than anything.\\xa0 Almost akin to obsidian, but not quite so sharp at the edges of each plane.</p>\\n<p>Where had he picked that up?</p>\\n<p>The stitched.\\xa0 The one that had fallen from the wall.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBullet?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t make out what he was saying over the chaos of the combat.</p>\\n<p>They examined the thing between them, each keeping half of an eye on the situation, half on the bullet.\\xa0 My focus was on trying to track how the situation was unfolding.</p>\\n<p>I blinked hard, trying to clear my vision.\\xa0 My nose and eye were burning, and it was a surprising amount, considering how resistant I tended to be to most poisons and chemical weapons.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-to go!\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Stating the obvious, but sometimes the obvious needed to be stated.\\xa0 The problem wasn\\u2019t the enemy \\u2013 they were focusing on the warbeasts.\\xa0 It was our side, shooting blindly.</p>\\n<p>The gas canisters and weapons that had opened the foray were long out of juice, and wind was carrying away the worst of the gas.\\xa0 The area was clearing up, which made us easier to spot.</p>\\n<p>The distance to the next set of structures that could provide cover was two hundred feet.\\xa0 Short grass, torn-up dirt, mud, and loose, crushed stone.</p>\\n<p>I heard a shout from the among the plague men.\\xa0 A sharp <em>crack</em> marked an explosive going off in their vicinity.\\xa0 Heads were turned away, hands raised to faces.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t see,\\u201d Gordon said, rubbing at his eyes with a sleeve.</p>\\n<p>With my shoulder pressed up against Mary\\u2019s side, I felt rather than heard the affirmative sound she made.</p>\\n<p>There was no happy ending here.\\xa0 Even if the Brigadier stepped in and got the Academy to start fighting back properly, and if Helen, Jamie, Lillian and Shipman knew enough to start an effort to extract us, I wasn\\u2019t sure it was possible.\\xa0 We were too close to the enemy, our side had given ground, and we\\u2019d been left behind.</p>\\n<p>Half-blind, outnumbered.</p>\\n<p>The warbeasts were struggling.\\xa0 They spent more time flinching and snarling at the gunfire than attacking.\\xa0 I heard the louder fire of the exorcists going off.\\xa0 The warbeast farthest from us staggered and dropped.\\xa0 A moment later, it was on fire, ignited by something thrown.</p>\\n<p>In case of parasites more than anything else, I suspected.</p>\\n<p>I reached out, pushing my fingers into Gordon\\u2019s closed fist.\\xa0 He was gripping a handkerchief.</p>\\n<p>He loosened his fingers, then held his hand out as I unfolded the handkerchief and took the black shard from within.</p>\\n<p>I pricked the back of my hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMf,\\u201d I made a sound.</p>\\n<p>It burned like fire.\\xa0 Within a few seconds, the muscle was twitching involuntarily, the burning sensation like a thousand papercuts a second.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmmmurrggh,\\u201d I started off making one sound, then ended up making a guttural noise instead.\\xa0 My voice was tight as I managed an, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe heck are you doing?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s poisoned,\\u201d I said, my voice still tight.\\xa0 \\u201cOr it\\u2019s crystallized poison or it\\u2019s <em>something</em>.\\xa0 Ow.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPeralta?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPeralta,\\u201d I said, in a strained, intense way.</p>\\n<p>There was a detonation closer to the wall, aimed at one of the beasts.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t do much more than kick up dirt.\\xa0 The cliff-side was only a dozen feet away, and both debris and moisture bounced off of the wall to land on and around us.</p>\\n<p>Shorter ranged guns, delivering only pain.</p>\\n<p>I remembered how the stitched had acted.</p>\\n<p><em>That</em> had been the aim.\\xa0 It was why our lines were disintegrating as fast as they were.\\xa0 Faced with stitched and warbeasts who felt only as much pain as they needed to be able to function, Pock had given the enemy a weapon that delivered it, <em>distilled</em>.</p>\\n<p>The alarm on Mary\\u2019s face suggested she was very aware of just what that meant.\\xa0 The look on Gordon\\u2019s face, as he stared at the ongoing fight with the Warbeasts, was one of deep concern.</p>\\n<p>The beasts didn\\u2019t know how to process the experience.\\xa0 Their well of experience might have been limited to experiencing only a moment of pain, enough to know where the harm was coming from so they could lash out.\\xa0 Except now they were feeling that moment over and over, from all directions.\\xa0 They lunged, swung their horns around, howled, and attacked nothing in particular, only periodically going after the plague men.</p>\\n<p>The pain in my hand was fading.\\xa0 Whatever it was, it didn\\u2019t last forever.</p>\\n<p>But that had only been a trace contact.\\xa0 Getting <em>shot</em> by one of these, it would be more than a trace contact.</p>\\n<p>Agony the <em>dead</em> would feel, apparently.</p>\\n<p>We were losing the cover of smoke and gas, and even with the less affected eye, the one that I had kept closed, I couldn\\u2019t make out the enemy as more than smudgy abstracts.\\xa0 I doubted they were suffering in the same way.</p>\\n<p>I put the black crystal on the ground, then grabbed a stone from the pile.</p>\\n<p>I smacked it, aiming for only the tip.\\xa0 The motion got Gordon and Mary\\u2019s attention.</p>\\n<p>Lifting the rock, I saw that the crystal had broken up.</p>\\n<p>Which suggested that getting shot by one didn\\u2019t mean having to extract one shard, but possibly dozens.</p>\\n<p>I grabbed the longest, narrowest one, and bent it until it snapped in two.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat-\\u201d Mary said, before gunfire drowned her out.\\xa0 They were exorcising the third warbeast. \\u201c-ng?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKnife,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>She had a knife in her hand in less than a second.\\xa0 She looked at it, then at me, as if only now questioning it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCut my stitches,\\u201d I said, lifting up my shirt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t see, Sy,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 Well, I was pretty sure it was what she\\u2019d said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCut,\\u201d I told her, again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-Idea?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>The exorcist\\u2019s fire had died out, and the third warbeast was dead.\\xa0 Scary to realize the plague men had dispatched three of the things, and I wasn\\u2019t sure they\\u2019d lost more than a half-dozen of their own.</p>\\n<p>It was more alarming to realize that the primary source of gunfire was in the other direction from the gate.\\xa0 A little ways down the road.\\xa0 Hopefully it was because our side had pulled back to regroup, and not because the plague men were crushing us underfoot as they advanced.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIdea,\\u201d I confirmed for Gordon, lowering my voice now that the gunfire was further away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTry to cut,\\u201d Gordon told Mary.</p>\\n<p>I saw her head bob.</p>\\n<p>Her vision was bad enough that she had to lean close to use the knife.\\xa0 Her nose touched my stomach, making one muscle twitch in a ticklish reaction.\\xa0 Her hot breath swept over my cold, wet skin.</p>\\n<p>She had steady hands.\\xa0 I flinched as she cut one suture, then another.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStop,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She did, without moving her head away.\\xa0 She turned her face upward, to look at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow sure are you?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMake the wound bleed,\\u201d I said, then, barely able to hear even my own words, I admitted, \\u201cNot very, but there\\u2019s not much room for cleverness here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Mary cut.\\xa0 My stomach moved of its own accord.</p>\\n<p>Too much of this plan depended on factors I couldn\\u2019t control or wholly predict.\\xa0 Educated guesses.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLose the weapons,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Rather than try to work my holster off of my belt, I simply undid my belt entirely, hauling it off.\\xa0 I jammed it into a gap between stone and wood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll the weapons?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKeep your knives.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were shouts and calls.\\xa0 More people at the gate.\\xa0 The enemy was moving up.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t tell if it was ten or fifty.\\xa0 My vision was suffering too much.</p>\\n<p>I judged distance, took the broken black crystal and poked a hole in my shirt, so it stuck through.\\xa0 I did it with more of the shards, spreading them out.</p>\\n<p>I looked at the black crystals.\\xa0 If they were poison, and I was resistant to poison, were they worse for someone else?\\xa0 Or were they not poison at all, their design a detour of sorts?\\xa0 A way to simulate pain without using the regular channels?</p>\\n<p>Either way, this was going to suck.</p>\\n<p>Fingers placed alongside the fabric, spikes of black crystal poking through and pointed inward, I slapped the fabric against my own stomach, the biggest shard touching the wound Mary had opened up.</p>\\n<p>The pain was immediate and mind-altering.</p>\\n<p>I screamed without even meaning to, keeling over, landing in mud.\\xa0 I might have drove shards deeper as I landed on the ones at my side.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d experienced agony before, on a monthly schedule.\\xa0 I knew how to deal, in a way.\\xa0 This blew that out of the water, made it impossible to turn my mind to reach for any of the tools.\\xa0 I\\u2019d stabbed my side, and I felt it in my bones and in my brain, in the nerves of my teeth.</p>\\n<p>I was glad I\\u2019d fallen forward, because I screamed until something changed in my throat and I heaved up my stomach contents.</p>\\n<p>I was dimly aware of an enemy soldier standing over us.\\xa0 One of the plague men.</p>\\n<p>Mary was screaming.\\xa0 About being blind, unable to see what was happening to me.</p>\\n<p>The plague man stared down, expression unchanging.</p>\\n<p>Variables I couldn\\u2019t predict or control.</p>\\n<p>Educated guesses alone.</p>\\n<p>Failing any other variables, anything at all, human beings tended to favor the simplest, clearest options.\\xa0 The easiest thing for him to do, without emotion or orders saying otherwise, was to shoot and end us.</p>\\n<p>That was only one of a half-dozen things that could go wrong.</p>\\n<p>But he had to have a reason to fight.\\xa0 A reason to change himself so drastically.\\xa0 There was an answer to that question that could see us through.</p>\\n<p>An iota of mercy?</p>\\n<p>He grabbed me by the arm, dragging me, weapon in one hand.\\xa0 As my body stretched out, the shards making contact with me touched me areas of my gut.\\xa0 They weren\\u2019t deep, except for the big one, but all the same, it renewed the pain twice over.</p>\\n<p>It was almost transcendant, taking me out of myself.\\xa0 I was wide-eyed, incapable of moving.\\xa0 Processing the little I could see and hear and storing almost none of it.</p>\\n<p>Dim light and noise, darkness.</p>\\n<p>Mary.</p>\\n<p>Gordon.</p>\\n<p>A flickering light so bright I couldn\\u2019t look at it.\\xa0 My head lolled to one side, and I focused on the darkness there, and the square of faint orange-purple light.</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s voice, again.</p>\\n<p>The pain was getting easier to bear.</p>\\n<p>A man\\u2019s voice.\\xa0 Soothing.\\xa0 I was trying to scream, I hadn\\u2019t stopped, but the energy wasn\\u2019t there.\\xa0 My chest jerked, and only small sounds came out.</p>\\n<p>I closed my eyes.\\xa0 The pain was receding more.</p>\\n<p>I could process.\\xa0 I was in a tent.\\xa0 The wall to one side was stone.\\xa0 The exterior wall of Westmore.\\xa0 By the gate.</p>\\n<p>I was on a table.\\xa0 A doctor was extracting shards from my side.\\xa0 One of the rebellion doctors.</p>\\n<p>My head turned.\\xa0 On the other side of the room, Gordon and Mary sat in chairs.\\xa0 Their hands were bound in front of them.</p>\\n<p>A plague man with a gun was standing beside the pair, weapon in hand.\\xa0 I still couldn\\u2019t really see.\\xa0 Nothing had fixed things from before.\\xa0 The only improvement was that there was light and we were out of the rain.</p>\\n<p>Cynthia had to have told them to watch out for children.\\xa0 My educated guess had been right, however.\\xa0 These were men who\\u2019d undergone changes for a reason.\\xa0 There was a rationale, partially driven by fear, but partially driven by a desire to oppose the Academy.\\xa0 They were almost an <em>incarnation</em> of that.</p>\\n<p>Opposing the Academies meant opposing the way the Academy operated.\\xa0 There had to be a sense of conscience in there.\\xa0 A child wounded with a weapon meant for monsters, even if they had orders to kill children on sight?\\xa0 I\\u2019d gambled on them showing mercy.</p>\\n<p>This one had a parasite living under his skin on one side of his face.\\xa0 It kept moving, making his facial features change each time.\\xa0 One of his eyes didn\\u2019t close properly.</p>\\n<p>Parasites that would prey on other parasites?\\xa0 Chemicals to counteract other poisons or stave off disease, all with their severe side effects?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re more alert?\\u201d the doctor that was working on me asked.\\xa0 \\u201cOne big one, then we take off your shirt and see if there\\u2019s more to dig out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs he okay?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t see.\\xa0 I can only see your shape, kind of, because the window is behind you, but I can\\u2019t see Simon, and he\\u2019s not screaming any more and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHush,\\u201d the doctor said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019ll be fine.\\xa0 The shards never penetrate too deep.\\xa0 They\\u2019re a nonlethal measure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>When the victims don\\u2019t commit suicide to end the pain, I imagine</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>Mary hadn\\u2019t been saying what she\\u2019d said for the doctor\\u2019s benefit, but for mine.</p>\\n<p>Already thinking about how we might find our way out.</p>\\n<p>My back arched, the pain searing me as the shard was pulled free of the wound, making a sucking sound.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere we go, hold on, wait,\\u201d the doctor said.\\xa0 He pressed something to the wound to absorb the welling blood.\\xa0 I would have lost more blood and had it welling around the site of injury, thanks to the extra damage Mary had inflicted.\\xa0 Part of my attempt to draw pity.</p>\\n<p>All of it calculated, in a way.\\xa0 If Mary had been the one injured, then we would have been two scraggly boys.\\xa0 This way, there was one hurt child on the table, and one girl in the chair.</p>\\n<p>There were more factors, but this was the ideal combination.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay?\\u201d the doctor asked.</p>\\n<p>I opened my mouth to respond, but my words didn\\u2019t come out.\\xa0 I\\u2019d lost the ability to speak.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny pain, still?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I made a face and nodded.</p>\\n<p>A lie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s take a look, then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He peeled my bloody shirt away from my stomach.</p>\\n<p>I turned my head away, and met Mary\\u2019s eyes.</p>\\n<p>I reached out to the pair of them.\\xa0 And I gestured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to be okay, Sy,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Two affirmatives.\\xa0 We were good to go.</p>\\n<p>I blinked, very deliberately.</p>\\n<p>On the other side, the doctor said, \\u201cWhat the hell?\\xa0 You\\u2019re already-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Her bound hands went over her head.\\xa0 She brought them forward together, simultaneously.\\xa0 A two-handed throw for a lone knife.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-injured?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The knife caught the doctor in the throat.</p>\\n<p>I tried to move, and realized I was bound with cord- enough I couldn\\u2019t move freely, but loose enough I could be repositioned.</p>\\n<p>Gordon brought his knees to his chest.\\xa0 Rope that had bound his ankles to the chair was loose enough to fall to the floor.\\xa0 He was up and out of the chair, hands still bound, moving past Mary to where reference books sat on a military travel chest.\\xa0 He grabbed a book and threw it like he was thrusting it into the air more than anything.</p>\\n<p>The plague man only managed a short sound of alarm before the book caught him in the lower face.\\xa0 I was betting Gordon was aiming for the throat, but a smack to the mouth served for a moment.</p>\\n<p>Gordon threw his whole weight against the man\\u2019s knee.\\xa0 He hit the ground, and the plague man fell over top of him.\\xa0 Gordon used the rope that bound his wrists to choke the plague man.</p>\\n<p>Nobody had responded to the yell of alarm.\\xa0 I wondered if there had been enough screaming from this tent to desensitize.</p>\\n<p>Three seconds passed, the doctor gurgling, the plague man choking, trying to throw Gordon loose and failing, and Mary- I couldn\\u2019t make out what Mary was doing.</p>\\n<p>The ropes were severed, I realized.\\xa0 She was free.\\xa0 She bent down over the plague man and cut his throat.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s hands were freed.\\xa0 He extricated himself.</p>\\n<p>I was next to be freed.\\xa0 I held the bandage to the thrice-opened wound as I lowered my feet to the ground.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSometimes I think you do that to yourself on purpose,\\u201d Gordon murmured.</p>\\n<p>I opened my mouth.\\xa0 No words came out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like you like this,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>I gestured.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe need to get out of here,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I gestured again.\\xa0 This time it was something less obscene.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t know what you mean by that one,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWar, battle?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFighting our way out?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 She\\u2019d bent down over the plague man.</p>\\n<p>I sighed, shaking my head.</p>\\n<p>Bending down, wincing, I picked up the book.\\xa0 I tore out a page and balled it up.\\xa0 I held thumb and one finger together under it.\\xa0 Not a gesture, but I hoped the idea was clear.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFire,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t do too much damage.\\xa0 Westmore needs to be able to use the location.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head again.\\xa0 I blinked hard, trying to clear my vision and failing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve lost this one,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cPlague men, black bullets, they have answers to what the Academy can bring to bear.\\xa0 Best we can do is cut our losses.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I could have hugged her.\\xa0 I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe should try that way, if I remember right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The three of us, with probably one set of working eyes between us, moved to the other end of the tent.\\xa0 It was getting brighter outside.\\xa0 The orange and purple light I\\u2019d seen was the sunrise.</p>\\n<p>We ducked under the bottom of the canvas flap, peeked into the adjoining tent, and then moved through there.</p>\\n<p>The enemy\\u2019s focus was on the front lines of the battle, from the sounds of it.\\xa0 There were barely any figures in the makeshift camp they\\u2019d set up at the gate.</p>\\n<p>But they\\u2019d brought some supplies and they\\u2019d left some behind.\\xa0 The incendiary weapons they\\u2019d used to dispose of the warbeasts were among them.</p>\\n<p>Any building we passed that had a window was on fire moments after we\\u2019d left it behind us.\\xa0 Nearly blind, we passed through the freezing rain, heading straight for their back lines and for the other Lambs.</p>\\n<p><a

present and waiting.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo activity,\\u201d Gordon said, raising his voice to be heard from the other end of the room.\\xa0 \\u201cDouble guards are stationed, and ambushes are laying in

hadn\\u2019t been an attack yet.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary had left to do another circuit around Westmore, checking for anything suspicious, and now they were back, having picked up Shipman from the residence at the tail end of their route.\\xa0 The rest of us had gathered, but we were in a position where we were tired and lacked many concrete things to do, but not quite able to relax.\\xa0 Jamie was at the table with the maps and some books spread in front of him, filling his head with any knowledge that might be relevant.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was with Jamie, and the two of them were talking in low voices, as Jamie explained something or other.\\xa0 They were both very good at the \\u2018library whisper\\u2019, and had a way of looking like they were sharing a secret when they did so.\\xa0 It had something to do with the energy they had when they talked, Jamie finishing sentences, helping Lillian\\u2019s verbal stride rather than harming it, yet not getting so excited that they forgot how others might be bothered.</p>\\n<p>I walked around to look over their shoulders.</p>\\n<p>A list of the various projects ongoing in Whitney.\\xa0 Jamie was supplying additional details, some major, some minor.\\xa0 Even noting the people that some of the scientists had been talking to at the gathering we\\u2019d passed through.</p>\\n<p>Lillian looked up at me and smiled as I walked around the table.\\xa0 I walked past my empty cup of tea and the plate with a shortbread cookie on it, both provided by the Brigadier\\u2019s stitched.\\xa0 I collected the one piece of shortbread I hadn\\u2019t eaten.</p>\\n<p>Helen was at the opposite end, curled up in a chair that had been grown rather than carved, shaped as the branches grew.\\xa0 For a large man, it would be snug, but Helen was curled up rather comfortably, feet under her, a heavy blanket surrounding everything but her head, which was already healing a lot of the damage that had been done earlier.\\xa0 A few red patches with the skin loose at the edges, darker circles under the eyes, but she was mostly alright.</p>\\n<p>I jabbed the shortbread at her face, and she opened her mouth in time to intercept it, clamping down with her teeth.\\xa0 She ate it without pulling her arms free from the bundle of blanket.</p>\\n<p>Walking past Helen, I intercepted Gordon, Shipman, and Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBrigadier is out ordering some minor changes to organization,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think he\\u2019s doing it to have something to do more than out of real strategic reasons.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt can be both,\\u201d Gordon observed.\\xa0 \\u201cBy giving the orders and changing the organization, he gets to refresh himself on who is where.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd he changes things up, which makes things harder on spies,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cSpies and infiltrators thrive on consistency.\\xa0 Being unpredictable here helps.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis was your idea,\\u201d Gordon said, realizing it out loud.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe was suspicious, but I convinced him that he would only be waiting around here, and we could send anyone important his way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re pleased with yourself,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA win for everyone involved,\\u201d I said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cExcept the losing side.\\xa0 Or a loss for everyone and a win for them, if our guess is wrong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf they don\\u2019t attack tonight, we lose some clout with the Brigadier,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey will,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you had no ulterior motives in getting rid of the Brigadier, hm?\\u201d Mary asked, one eyebrow arched.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019ll be back,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t answer the question,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I made a face.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to plant our feet here.\\xa0 This can\\u2019t be a prolonged engagement.\\xa0 They\\u2019re too angry, and that\\u2019s a fire that burns hot and fast.\\xa0 Once they get past the wall, it\\u2019s going to be over.\\xa0 Not guaranteed to be a win for them, but it\\u2019s going to be over.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat has what to do with the Brigadier, exactly?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI figure there\\u2019ll only be two or three big clashes before this swings one way or the other, the upcoming ambush excepted.\\xa0 If we lose the Brigadier\\u2019s trust, we can\\u2019t be certain we\\u2019ll get it back before things are over.\\xa0 So I figure we set down roots, work ourselves into the greater scheme of things.\\xa0 A little signal or change of plans that makes this lodge more our base of operations than his, if you will.\\xa0 He leaves, we stay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s an awful lot of thinking and work for a pretty minor advantage,\\u201d Gordon observed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWasn\\u2019t a compliment,\\u201d he told me, jabbing me with his elbow on his way to the table.\\xa0 I turned and kicked at his rear end with a sock-clad foot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll thank me later,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr, or!\\xa0 You could thank me now.\\xa0 Because you got what you wanted.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you Sy,\\u201d he said, in a sing-song voice.</p>\\n<p>Helen excepted, we gathered at the end of the table near Lillian and Jamie.\\xa0 I waved a hand a few times to get the attention of the Brigadier\\u2019s fire-tending stitched and then asked for tea.</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t as clever or animated as Wendy was.\\xa0 When the fire dropped to a certain temperature, he put a log on, and poked it or used the bellows.\\xa0 When there weren\\u2019t any logs, he went out and collected some from the stockpile.\\xa0 He could make tea and presumably handle a small handful of other errands.\\xa0 He likely couldn\\u2019t dress himself \\u2013 his outfit was simple and probably wasn\\u2019t changed more than once a blue moon.</p>\\n<p>The world was so backwards in some ways.\\xa0 We hadn\\u2019t progressed a slow and steady path from the normal to the horrific.\\xa0 We\\u2019d jumped headlong into the horrific, with stitched like these preceding ones like Wendy, and an advanced project like Gordon, who was in many ways a stitched who had never died.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have a few big questions that are hanging over our heads,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe next attack is the big one.\\xa0 Where, when, how, and which one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich assassin,\\u201d I clarified.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 Which brings us to what and how, if the assassin gets past us,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I always liked seeing Jamie when he got going.\\xa0 It usually took a while, some prep time with information at his fingertips, but the rarity of these moments made them all the more fun.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere isn\\u2019t much we can do to answer those questions before the attack happens,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, there isn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut we can think about what we do if and when things get that far,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut we can\\u2019t do that until we raise the other questions, which tie in or complicate things,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 <em>Handing the ball back to you, Jamie</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey have a trump card,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey were <em>confident</em> about their ability to take Westmore.\\xa0 It might have something to do with the plague men.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe men with the boils and scars,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cBut we don\\u2019t know much about them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey were physically and mentally affected,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOff kilter from the rest of the soldiers, isolated, excluded.\\xa0 When they appeared in groups, they were with stitched or they were with others of their own kind.\\xa0 Usually.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The others nodded.\\xa0 They\\u2019d each seen the men around, to varying degrees depending on how much they roamed the city, and what I was saying didn\\u2019t seem to conflict with their own observations.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI noted the presence of about a hundred in total,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat many?\\u201d I asked, surprised.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere might be more,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere might be less.\\xa0 I\\u2019m wondering if any experienced swelling, which would alter their faces, maybe lead to me counting some of them twice.\\xa0 It would be easier to say if I got out more, but I wasn\\u2019t really wanting to explain why I was always coming and going from Ames\\u2019 headquarters.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA hundred,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe have no idea of what they do or why they\\u2019re there.\\xa0 Were they voluntary or forced?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMight explain the mental issues, how some of them were almost catatonic when they weren\\u2019t actively doing something.\\xa0 Alterations made to keep them compliant?\\u201d I suggested.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCreepy,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut I\\u2019m wondering if it\\u2019s something else,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I thought for a second, trying to find the words.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d Gordon prompted me, impatient.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t put a finger on it.\\xa0 But they had a kind of respect from others?\\xa0 Someone walks down the street, other people get out of their way.\\xa0 But someone commands your attention, like a pretty girl might-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I gestured in Mary and Lillian\\u2019s direction, not ignoring Shipman, but not really indicating her either.\\xa0 Mary smiled, and Lillian looked shocked and a little confused.\\xa0 Which was why I\\u2019d done it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAhem,\\u201d Helen said the word rather than make the sound, sitting at the other end of the table.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re ugly right now, with the marks all over your face.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t get to play that card,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAw,\\u201d Helen said, at the same time Lillian gave me an indignant, \\u201cSy!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe doesn\\u2019t mind,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t mind,\\u201d Helen said, blithely.\\xa0 \\u201cSy\\u2019s good in my books.\\xa0 He gave me one of his cookies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSee?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian glared at me, looking very uncomfortable, yet she couldn\\u2019t formulate an argument as to why or to make her point.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you done interrupting me, <em>girls?</em>\\u201d I asked, mostly to needle Lillian.</p>\\n<p>She opened her mouth to protest, but the front door opened.\\xa0 The Brigadier, with a retainer of stitched guards.</p>\\n<p>I cleared my throat.\\xa0 \\u201cJust like a pretty girl draws attention, being noticed and then holding some <em>sway</em> by some invisible rules, I feel like maybe the plague men had that sway.\\xa0 But it was respect.\\xa0 No hard facts, like I said.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not Jamie.\\xa0 But that\\u2019s my interpretation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGoing by what you said before, you think this was voluntary.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think it might have been,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMight be a project that was supposed to end up different than it did.\\xa0 But I think those are men that know how to use guns.\\xa0 They had <em>bearing.\\xa0 </em>A part of me wonders if they aren\\u2019t veteran soldiers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI put the image in my mind\\u2019s eye together with what you\\u2019re saying, and I can see how you\\u2019d make that connection,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The stitched boy brought tea over.\\xa0 He began pouring it into mugs.\\xa0 I was still standing, so I walked over to Helen and collected her cup, bringing it down to the other end of the table.</p>\\n<p>The Brigadier joined us, stopping by his desk to collect an empty cup from there for his own tea.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t place it with the other cups, but held onto it, waiting for us to be served before he was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t make assumptions,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can\\u2019t assume that one thing is going to work or that another will lead to certain victory.\\xa0 They have a trump card, and they have the plague man soldiers.\\xa0 When they attack the side gate, we can\\u2019t assume we stopped the assassin from getting in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The Brigadier\\u2019s deeper voice cut in, quiet and confident.\\xa0 \\u201cThe problem with that approach, and I\\u2019m speaking from experience here, is that you can\\u2019t do that without taxing yourself.\\xa0 Covering every possibility, all of the angles, every eventuality, it exhausts you, opens you to mistakes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s true,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo an extent,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut there are two things to keep in mind here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m very interested in hearing this,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe first thing is that this is likely to be a short engagement, not wanting to <em>assume</em>, but going with common sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t disagree,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe second thing is that we, as a group, are six individuals with experience not just in working together, but in <em>thinking</em> together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are seven of you,\\u201d the older man pointed out.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, with Shipman right beside him, was giving me a hard look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThose two are two peas in a pod,\\u201d I said, in a very cavalier way.\\xa0 \\u201cSemantics!\\xa0 We think well as a unit.\\xa0 Fourteen eyes and seven brains on the situation\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you prove that, I\\u2019ll be glad to rely on you for that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow are the soldiers?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cMorale-wise?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow is anyone, after a fight like that?\\u201d the Brigadier asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThirty of ours were injured, seven killed.\\xa0 The injuries can be fixed, the deaths\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe dead can be made into stitched,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr were they using those special guns?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe exorcists you described,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cBig exit wounds.\\xa0 Looking at it, I\\u2019d guess we\\u2019d get six stitched out of them.\\xa0 Take one man apart for replacement parts.\\xa0 But we\\u2019re not going to do that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a strength of the Academy, being able to recycle its soldiers,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn terms of the raw numbers it can bring to bear, yes.\\xa0 But if a man fights and realizes the stitched fighting next to him is a face he recognizes, he starts to have doubts,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ve promised him that if he falls, he\\u2019ll end up the same.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a doubt that works its way deep.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFear of that fate could push someone to fight harder,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cSir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man waved his hand.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s dispense of those formalities while we\\u2019re in private.\\xa0 I\\u2019d rather focus on giving my enemies something to fear.\\xa0 No need to bring it inside these walls.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Which is why we\\u2019re in this situation in the first place</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>The Brigadier held his tea, poised as if to drink it, but he talked instead.\\xa0 \\u201cThe six soldiers we\\u2019d gain aren\\u2019t worth the hundreds of soldiers we\\u2019d lose, from a loyalty perspective.\\xa0 Not that they\\u2019d leave, not like this, but their hearts wouldn\\u2019t be in it, they would stop being wholly <em>ours</em>, and they\\u2019d end up turning a share of their time, thoughts and energy to self-preservation\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He punctuated the thought by finally drinking that tea.</p>\\n<p>I wanted to like him more now that he was debating with us and challenging us, but I could remember the look in his eye from earlier, and the softness of his approach.</p>\\n<p>I respected jerks more.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure if this guy would have what it took to cover my back if and when it <em>really </em>counted.</p>\\n<p>I looked over to what Jamie had in front of him.\\xa0 It looked handwritten, with black letters.\\xa0 The Brigadier\\u2019s notes?</p>\\n<p>I reached out and moved the paper to a better angle so I could read it, saucer with tea in my other hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe notes from previous skirmishes.\\xa0 Warning shots, sightings, scoutings\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t all peace before you arrived,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded, \\u201cThey didn\\u2019t want to provoke a fight, but they weren\\u2019t hiding either.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey have new leadership,\\u201d I observed.\\xa0 \\u201cThat woman-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCynthia,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot sure if she\\u2019ll be deferring to the rebellion\\u2019s military leaders when it comes to strategy, or if she\\u2019ll be doing it when it comes to the particulars of leadership, or if she\\u2019ll be doing neither or both.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAfter we observe their movements, do you think you\\u2019d be able to tell who\\u2019s behind them?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s abstract,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI work better with concrete things.\\xa0 I can try, but I\\u2019d rather give you guys the knowledge you need and let you make the calls.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>I made a mental note to ask Jamie.\\xa0 When things got hectic, he could often get lost in the shuffle, wanting to say something but not getting a chance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m also trying to keep track of this.\\xa0 If we can gauge the weapons, units, or devices our opposition is using, we can try to figure out what each of the rogue scientists they brought in has been busy working on,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve been trying to draw a connection between one of the scientists and the plague men, and Lillian was helping, extrapolating.\\xa0 I was thinking of Leopold Pock, but if you\\u2019re right about them being veterans, that would eliminate the possibility.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExplain?\\u201d the Brigadier asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAugmented soldiers we observed in Whitney.\\xa0 Sy thinks they\\u2019re soldiers that voluntarily underwent some augmentation.\\xa0 A lot of soldiers, choosing an augmentation that makes them hideous, and does something to their minds.\\xa0 Likely a permanent change, or as permanent as anything we do to our bodies is.\\xa0 We\\u2019re trying to figure them out.\\xa0 Why they\\u2019d do it, who did it, specifically.\\xa0 Pock is tentatively ruled out.\\xa0 Doesn\\u2019t fit the working theory.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo idea about their capabilities?\\u201d the Brigadier asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA lot of soldiers,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cA hundred, at least.\\xa0 What makes that many men want to change themselves that much?\\xa0 Enough that a small child might cry to look at them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHmm,\\u201d the Brigadier made a sound.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExpert opinion is welcome,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat does every soldier want?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo go home,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cSafe and whole.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn their eyes, we attacked them at home,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re no longer whole, either.\\xa0 In fact, they\\u2019re less whole after the procedure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNext best thing to going home,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo not have to be afraid anymore,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p>He said it so readily, as if he didn\\u2019t even have to think about it.\\xa0 He simply <em>knew</em>.\\xa0 They were heavy words, and we were quiet as the words sat with us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cShipman too, I guess-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Shipman looked irritated at that.\\xa0 Gordon too.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-Any ideas on what-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gunshots sounded in the distance.\\xa0 A few shots at once, then a veritable <em>torrent</em>.</p>\\n<p>From the right direction, no less.</p>\\n<p>I was the first one to the front door.\\xa0 I hopped into my rain-boots rather than pull them on, catching the door for balance as my stomach protested where I\\u2019d been shot.</p>\\n<p>Lillian said something to rebuke me, but I was already pushing the door open, hurrying outside with my raincoat in hand but not yet worn.</p>\\n<p>My stomach continued to throb now and again, and I forced myself to slow down.\\xa0 The others caught up with me, the Brigadier among them.\\xa0 Even Helen and Jamie.</p>\\n<p>It <em>was</em> the gate I\\u2019d predicted.\\xa0 It was human nature to default to the simple, and to take shortcuts.\\xa0 Sending people further down the network of roads was risky.\\xa0 It was more opportunities for our side to spot them, or for them to get stranded if things came down to it.</p>\\n<p>This one was a gimme.</p>\\n<p>Just as the Brigadier had sought to break our enemies\\u2019 will, they were putting pressure on us now.\\xa0 The attack was meant to keep us on our toes, to wear down on morale, and getting an assassin inside the doors would give them a chance to drive the wedge in.</p>\\n<p>The Brigadier broke away from our group to talk to some senior officers.\\xa0 <em>We</em> headed to the stairs that led up the one side of the wall.\\xa0 I had to hold up my badge to get through the little doorway and gate that blocked off the stairs.</p>\\n<p>Reaching the top, I could see flashes of red and yellow as guns fired.\\xa0 The road stretched along a pass, the floor of it loose, but too rocky to be proper mud.\\xa0 Crushed stone, provided from elsewhere.\\xa0 Steep rocky walls rose on either side.</p>\\n<p>The enemy had come up one side of the road, it looked like, taking shelter in the shadows beneath the rock wall on one side of the road.\\xa0 They\\u2019d discovered, too late, that stitched were lying in wait, kneeling in those same shadows.\\xa0 The stitched had reacted, firing, and a matching group on the other side of the pass did the same.</p>\\n<p>Someone from the rebellion had managed to start a fire before dying.\\xa0 A makeshift bomb, perhaps.\\xa0 Four or five stitched had fallen.\\xa0 Minor in the grand scheme of it all.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThirty or forty,\\u201d Jamie said, his voice soft.\\xa0 \\u201cDead.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know how you can even tell,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 It was the middle of the night, and the heavy rainclouds weren\\u2019t letting any moon show.</p>\\n<p>The smell of blood, feces, smoke, and gunpowder were thick in the air.\\xa0 I could imagine the rock walls on either side of the path were a funnel, bringing the smells in, in a very concentrated way.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can see them well enough to count them,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe gave the instructions that led to the deaths.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe decision to-\\u201d Gordon started.</p>\\n<p>I raised a hand, gesturing.\\xa0 He stopped.</p>\\n<p>Gordon would have argued, and shoved his way of thinking at Jamie, and Jamie would have agreed.\\xa0 It probably would have sunken in.\\xa0 Jamie would have internalized it, and it wouldn\\u2019t be a bad thing.</p>\\n<p>But I wanted to talk to <em>Jamie</em> about this, not to Gordon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe did give the instructions,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMe, mostly, but we all played a part, yeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt feels impersonal,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt is.\\xa0 It was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt feels worse for being impersonal.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve killed before,\\u201d I pointed out.\\xa0 \\u201cPersonal kills, you looked them in the eye.\\xa0 Even Phlegm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt feels worse for being impersonal,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow?\\u201d Gordon asked, all at once.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie shrugged.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t have an answer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhatever the reason,\\u201d I said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s allowed to feel however it feels.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThanks,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNever a problem.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The silence was broken up by handlers on the wall-top shouting down to the stitched below.\\xa0 We hadn\\u2019t lost any actual <em>lives</em> down there, and stitched were more expendable, tougher.\\xa0 Easier troops to field.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDidn\\u2019t see anyone climb the wall,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut if they did it at the start-\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Still fixated on the assassins.\\xa0 Not a bad thing</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll assume someone got in and take measures,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI kind of want to see the vat-grown humans that Polk made,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cI wonder if they can have babies?\\xa0 Jamie, do you know?\\xa0 Lillian?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian made a squeaking sound as her name was mentioned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you?\\u201d Helen pressed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy do you want to know?\\u201d Jamie asked, very cautiously, then before Helen could answer, he quickly added, \\u201cAnd do I want to know why you want to know?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m just curious,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo <em>you</em> want babies?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Why?\\xa0 What does that have to do with anything?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>Which all added up to the Lambs being very confused.</p>\\n<p>I wondered if Ibott had instructed Helen to practice psychological warfare.\\xa0 Her talk at the teahouse, and now this?\\xa0 If he\\u2019d given the order, she\\u2019d picked up on it remarkably fast.</p>\\n<p>The stitched turned on little lamps they had with them, and more were tossed down.\\xa0 Each lamp had mirrored metal around the majority of it, so a beam would be cast out in a cone.\\xa0 The light that was cast was a yellow-orange, and danced as the wind blew.</p>\\n<p>As the lamps lit up and the stitched spread out, we were given a view of the battlefield in all its garishness.\\xa0 The road was too rocky with too many gaps, and the rain had pounded down the blood that hadn\\u2019t slipped into the gaps.\\xa0 The bodies were just lying there, and without the right amounts of blood, they looked artificial, even posed.\\xa0 A little girl\\u2019s dolls, dropped and left in whatever position they fell.</p>\\n<p>I studied the cliff face, looking to see if maybe one of the assassins was utilizing it to climb.\\xa0 Nothing.</p>\\n<p><em>How were you planning to get in?</em>\\xa0 I wondered.</p>\\n<p>Jamie reached out, grabbing my upper arm.</p>\\n<p>He pointed.</p>\\n<p>There.\\xa0 At the rear of the group.\\xa0 A figure with features spaced too far apart, strange earlobes, and a girthy belly.</p>\\n<p>Phlegm lived?</p>\\n<p>No.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t buy it.\\xa0 The reactions of the woman with the teeth\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGuess we won\\u2019t find out,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The rain continued to pour down.\\xa0 I continued to try and think of all of the different vectors for attack.</p>\\n<p>I turned and headed down the stairs, approaching the Brigadier.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were right,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p><em>Oh.\\xa0 That.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Last thing on my mind.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne assassin fell, it looks like.\\xa0 But the man is supposed to be dead.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe dead can come back,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 Rain was streaming off his helmet, and collecting in his wooly chin-strap of a beard.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGuess so,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust sent my men out to get reports from each of the other gates.\\xa0 If this was a distraction, something might have happened elsewhere.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 We did have security measures at the other gates.\\xa0 The Academy forces of Westmore weren\\u2019t going to be sleeping tonight.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll see if your next prediction is right,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>Someone gave a shout, and the gate opened.\\xa0 The other Lambs were gathered together in clusters, or meandering down the stairs.\\xa0 Jamie and Helen were a little slower to move.</p>\\n<p>The stitched that had been stationed outside filed in, carrying the dead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll have some replacement stitched that won\\u2019t be hurting morale any,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cMight even come out ahead.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMight even,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cCan I have a bayonet?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been right twice.\\xa0 I get to ask for more favors, don\\u2019t I?\\xa0 Things that might be a little questionable or inconvenient?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI suppose,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 He gestured for a soldier to come closer, then took the man\\u2019s weapon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHold on,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t give it to me yet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It took another minute before the stitched had made it inside the walls.\\xa0 The gate creaked as it swung closed.\\xa0 Bars were lowered into place.</p>\\n<p>I reached out, and the bayonet slapped into my hand.</p>\\n<p>As I approached the line of stitched and bodies, Mary fell into step beside me.\\xa0 I extended the bayonet to her, and she tossed it into the air in front of me.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, appearing on my other side, caught it.\\xa0 By the time I looked back at Mary, she had knives in her hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe bodies,\\u201d I said, clearly, my gaze on the corpses that were being dragged.\\xa0 I raised my hands to my hood, pushing it back and running my fingers through my hair.\\xa0 My tone was weary as I said, \\u201cCheck the dead bodies.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon lowered the bayonet blade, aiming for the first corpse.</p>\\n<p>At the last second, before stabbing, he raised it, stabbing the stitched.</p>\\n<p>Mary moved fluidly, throwing her knives, hitting the second and third stitched in the line.</p>\\n<p>They reacted as anyone might.\\xa0 Alarmed, hurt, they reached for their weapons.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStand down!\\u201d the Brigadier hollered.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s an order!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The specialists on the wall and beside the line repeated the order, though they looked confused.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was already moving, aiming for the fourth stitched in the line.\\xa0 Mary threw knives at the fifth and sixth.</p>\\n<p>The sixth \\u2018stitched\\u2019 moved fluidly, knives in its own hands, as it struck the throwing knife out of the air.</p>\\n<p>Faster and more graceful than any stitched was.</p>\\n<p>Mary threw more knives, sprinting forward.\\xa0 The stitched hit them out of the air once more.\\xa0 It approached, picking up speed as it made a beeline for Gordon.\\xa0 It didn\\u2019t seem to care that he was armed, or that he was raising the gun to aim.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t Gordon that shot.\\xa0 Others on the sideline opened fire.\\xa0 As much as the man could knock a thrown knife out of the air, he couldn\\u2019t do much against bullets.\\xa0 He jerked, stumbled, and tripped over a corpse that lay on the ground behind him.</p>\\n<p>The rain continued to pour, the sound of the gunshots ringing in my ears.</p>\\n<p><em>No assumptions,</em> I thought.</p>\\n<p>Now the dance <em>really</em> began.\\xa0 With this ploy failing, our enemy would be forced to get creative.\\xa0 I\\u2019d get to see what kind of tacticians we were up against, and we\\u2019d have to match them in kind.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/08/25/esprit-de-corpse-5-12/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The two bodies were each held by four of the Academy\\u2019s soldiers.\\xa0 With a shout and a very practiced motion, the bodies were heaved up and onto freshly wiped granite slabs.\\xa0 One was Phlegm.\\xa0 The other was dressed as a stitched, complete with our uniform.</p>\\n<p>The doctors and scholars of Westmore were already collecting around, many wearing their coats and aprons, masks covering the lower halves of their face, goggles over their eyes.\\xa0 Black, elbow-length gloves were pulled over freshly washed hands.\\xa0 The room was open-air, a shelter for wagons, very possibly a drier point for coal to be offloaded, but canvas cloths had been tied down and sealed it off, with sandbags up to the four foot mark, providing some insulation and walls.\\xa0 The floor was packed soil, and was caked with old blood, shit, and other detritus.\\xa0 Kits off to the side had all of the material needed for stitched, while toolbox-like constructions were in one corner, providing other tools for more conventional medical care.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOut of the way,\\u201d a man told me, as he wheeled a cart over to the foot of the table.\\xa0 He had more than enough room.\\xa0 He was just bullying me, indicating that I was not supposed to be here, in a way that meant he didn\\u2019t have to say it outright.</p>\\n<p>I hopped up onto a stack of sandbags in the corner.\\xa0 I offered Mary a hand in climbing up next to me.\\xa0 Totally unnecessary, but I had to be gentlemanly.\\xa0 Gordon, Lillian, and Shipman stood at the other side of the enclosure, pulling back into the corner a bit, where they were clear of the normal footpaths.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo children in the room,\\u201d one of the scholars said, getting in Mary\\u2019s way.\\xa0 Black coat, black apron, black gloves, a pin at his collar marking his rank, Field Surgeon.\\xa0 He was surrounded by grays and whites, some with pins, some without.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAhem,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 She took a quarter-second too long to say something, reaching for the badge in her pocket.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOut!\\u201d the man said, raising his voice, more at the fact that I hadn\\u2019t budged.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary were taking my cue.\\xa0 I pointed at Lillian.</p>\\n<p>Lillian spoke up, \\u201cI\\u2019d like to-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJohn, Troy, see that the children go,\\u201d the Surgeon said, turning his back.\\xa0 It was what I would have done.\\xa0 Deflecting and dismissing her, forcing her to appeal to more people, people who were in service to authority, a hard chain to break.</p>\\n<p>Lillian looked at me for help.\\xa0 I stayed quiet, watching.</p>\\n<p>Sure enough, two of the doctors who hadn\\u2019t yet washed up approached, ready to usher us out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSir,\\u201d Shipman said, her voice stronger than Lillian\\u2019s had been.\\xa0 She grabbed Lillian\\u2019s wrist, pulling Lillian\\u2019s hand from the pocket.\\xa0 Lillian was holding the badge.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019d like to stay.\\xa0 Pursuant to the Brigadier\\u2019s orders.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The surgeon turned to look back at the badge.\\xa0 He made a face, then raised his chin.\\xa0 \\u201cSir?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We turned, and we could see that the Brigadier was standing in the street with a few other men.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey can watch.\\xa0 Have them bring me the write-up when you\\u2019re done,\\u201d Brigadier Tylor said.\\xa0 Then he was gone, looking after other business.</p>\\n<p>The surgeon\\u2019s face was hidden by the mask and goggles, but I entertained myself by imagining that it looked like he was sucking on a lemon while he had his balls in a vise.</p>\\n<p>Probably wasn\\u2019t the case, but it was funny to imagine.</p>\\n<p>Mary and Shipman hurried to get to a vantage point where they wouldn\\u2019t be in the way.\\xa0 A tough job, considering how packed the space already was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTroy, would you take the notes?\\u201d the surgeon asked.\\xa0 Troy, still wearing the apron and coat, but not scrubbed in, picked up a pen and paper.\\xa0 John hurried to get to the sink and wash up.\\xa0 I presumed it was a constant competition to get recognition from the surgeon.</p>\\n<p>Another doctor took scissors to the clothing of the men, cutting away what they couldn\\u2019t open on their own.\\xa0 The men were soon left naked on the table.</p>\\n<p>Phlegm had a broad stomach, the sort where a strong man also ate too much.\\xa0 The muscle was there, underlying it, but it was insulated enough that the lines werent\\u2019 readily apparent.\\xa0 Thick neck, strangely spaced facial features, and odd earlobes, with messy hair.\\xa0 He was covered in deep, recognizable scars.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSubject appears to be stitched, standard \\u2018Y\\u2019 cut.\\xa0 The work looks as if it was done only hours ago.\\xa0 Trepanning method of lobotomy, holes still present, with skin flaps covering.\\xa0 This was a fast job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe killed him earlier today,\\u201d I commented.\\xa0 \\u201cThey needed a decoy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I want commentary, I will ask for it,\\u201d the surgeon said.</p>\\n<p>I raised my hands in the gesture for surrender.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe word \\u2018Phlegmatic\\u2019 is tattooed along the first subject\\u2019s collarbone,\\u201d the surgeon said, prodding the flesh.\\xa0 \\u201cBone structure stands out as differing from the norm.\\xa0 Fused collarbone, ribcage has flat affect across the front and back, with broader sternum and fused spaces between ribs.\\xa0 Vat-grown.\\xa0 Older scars suggest the changes are the result of grafts and prior work.\\xa0 Layered, different types of scars.\\xa0 The previous work was done over a long period of time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJohn, White, see to the staples.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Two others at the slab got pincer tools and began removing the staples.</p>\\n<p>The surgeon bent down, examining Phlegm\\u2019s face.\\xa0 \\u201cChanges are of a type expected from nineteen-ought attempts to modify the living code, rewriting the fabric of a grown individual.\\xa0 The grafts, to speculate, were part of efforts to repair the damage done with the system-wide changes.\\xa0 Subject had limited vision, with occlusion of the ocular cavity, sinus cavities, mouth -enlarged tongue- and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He pried Phlegm\\u2019s mouth open.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-throat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIntentional,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeg pardon?\\u201d the surgeon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d bet you dollars to pennies it\\u2019s intentional, and it can be controlled.\\xa0 He used weaponized gases, I think, before he died.\\xa0 The blockages would have been a casualty of the changes to his facial structure, and they were modified to serve a purpose.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf true, that will be verified at a later point,\\u201d the surgeon said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo more commentary from the gallery, please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen work by students who were trained by Phlegmatic\\u2019s creator, very similar.\\xa0 Efficient lungs, improved circulatory system, every orifice can be closed,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019d be made to hold his breath underwater for twenty minutes.\\xa0 Or in a cloud of noxious gas for twenty minutes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Was she like this around her classmates?\\xa0 I wondered how many of them wanted to throttle her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you for that observation,\\u201d the surgeon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sure we\\u2019ll see for ourselves when the time comes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou should pay attention to the ears and eyes,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cMost of the work would have been there.\\xa0 The eyes would need protection, which means there\\u2019s some interesting work-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The surgeon cleared his throat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s some interesting work done there, with eyes made immune to most airborne issues, or the eyes were sealed and he used another sense.\\xa0 Probably the ears.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I was willing to bet that if the Brigadier hadn\\u2019t given the okay, the Surgeon would have grabbed Lillian and literally thrown her out of the enclosure himself, even knowing he\\u2019d have to scrub down all over again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat an insightful set of observations,\\u201d the surgeon said, sarcastically.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you have anything more to say, or may I continue with the investigation?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, I\\u2019m done for now,\\u201d Lillian said, smiling, as if she had no idea he was upset.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll say more as things come up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll thank you not to,\\u201d the surgeon said, somewhat under his breath.\\xa0 \\u201cBefore we were interrupted, I was moving on to the ears.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Which was probably true, I imagined.\\xa0 It had to rankle.\\xa0 I noted that Shipman was murmuring something to Lillian, who was smiling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEar canal and normal ear structures are present, with little modification.\\xa0 The area surrounding, however, suggests a latticework of tympanic membranes, of varying size,\\u201d the surgeon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBarring another situation of heavy occlusion, he would have possessed exceptional hearing ability, both in terms of sensitivity and range.\\xa0 Moving on\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The surgeon moved away from the head.\\xa0 On to the torso.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe body is probably booby-trapped,\\u201d I commented, idly.</p>\\n<p>The surgeon reacted like he was going to lash out and say or do something, but then the words sank in.\\xa0 He remained frozen where he was, scalpel hovering over Phlegm\\u2019s chest.</p>\\n<p>I shrugged, very casually explaining, \\u201cHe was already dead.\\xa0 They made him into a stitched to bait us into thinking we\\u2019d caught one of their assassins.\\xa0 He\\u2019s resistant to many gases and poisons.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOoh!\\xa0 Of course!\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019d have bladders in his body, for holding reserve, or for buoyancy control, if he\\u2019s aquatic at all.\\xa0 Which is probably.\\xa0 Any one of the bladders could be pumped full and sealed.\\xa0 Would be.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The surgeon stared down at the body, scalpel still in hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust so you know,\\u201d Lillian said, smiling wider than before.\\xa0 She met my eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry to interrupt,\\u201d I told the surgeon and Lillian both.</p>\\n<p>Lillian, I was realized, was having a great deal of fun.</p>\\n<p>She and I didn\\u2019t get to play off each other like this, ever.\\xa0 The earlier attitude had been intentional, needling the man.</p>\\n<p>Not that she was necessarily wrong about the booby trap.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPerhaps,\\u201d the surgeon said, very carefully, \\u201cYou children would want to leave, to be safe?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot at all,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing to worry about, so long as you\\u2019re careful,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>Shipman cleared her throat.\\xa0 \\u201cI think <em>I\\u2019ll</em> step out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon reached out for her hand.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure if it was to hold her back or to offer reassurance of some sort, but the gesture was ignored.\\xa0 Shipman stalked out, flipping her hood up as she exited into the downpour.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\u2019t look at any of us as his hand fell back into his lap.</p>\\n<p>The surgeon went back to work.\\xa0 The staples were removed, and the man took a scalpel to the existing incisions, which had been glued shut.\\xa0 A very careful cut, with several slices, each one cutting only a fraction deeper.\\xa0 The skin parted, and a rank odor filled the enclosure.</p>\\n<p>People were alarmed, stepping back, hands to their masks.</p>\\n<p>But it was only the stench of death.\\xa0 This would be why the enclosure wasn\\u2019t properly indoors.\\xa0 It was a more ventilated space.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLow cook temperature for a stitched,\\u201d the surgeon observed.\\xa0 \\u201cRot setting in already.\\xa0 The wires are visible, recently implanted, with no overgrowth.\\xa0 A crude job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He moved a flap of skin.\\xa0 In the lower stomach, an oblong shape was nestled in just beneath the skin, anchored to fat and stomach wall.\\xa0 Stretched thin enough to be translucent, it had veins running along the surface.\\xa0 It had been inflated.</p>\\n<p>I saw the scalpel tremble a little as the surgeon pulled it away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwo air-bladders have been discovered.\\xa0 One penetrated by a bullet and explosively emptied when the stitched was incapacitated.\\xa0 The other remains active.\\xa0 The examination will be terminated here, due to observable risks should rot or infestation penetrate this or any other bladders inflated with airborne poisons.\\xa0 \\u201d</p>\\n<p>He stepped away, hands raised, scalpel in one, and gave the order, \\u201cClose him up.\\xa0 Seal him, wrap and bag him, dispose of him.\\xa0 Treat the body with care.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The people he\\u2019d given the instructions to didn\\u2019t look very happy to be assigned the task.\\xa0 Not just because of the traps, but it smelled worse with every passing second.</p>\\n<p>The surgeon went, removed his gloves, washed his hands, donned another pair of gloves, and then turned to the next body.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnything I should know before examining him?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe was quick,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut he wouldn\\u2019t be booby trapped.\\xa0 Probably.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The surgeon began cutting away the mask of flesh.\\xa0 \\u201cFresh.\\xa0 From one of ours, if I had to guess.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRemoved on the battlefield,\\u201d I chimed in, mostly to nettle him.\\xa0 \\u201cImpressive improvisational skills.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAhem.\\xa0 Troy?\\xa0 The notes.\\xa0 This is our second patient.\\xa0 Choleric, according to the label at his collarbone.\\xa0 The patients are named after the four humors, presumably.\\xa0 There are subtler signs of the same rewriting of the individual\\u2019s pattern, and similar means of grafting, likely from the same time period, suggesting they were worked on in concert.\\xa0 Academy level work, judging by quality.\\xa0 The goal varies, but the methodology matches our prior patient, Phlegmatic.\\xa0 Rictus smile-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause of changes to musculature and nervous system,\\u201d Lillian jumped in.\\xa0 \\u201cNo occlusion this time, of course.\\xa0 I think if you look at the eyes, you\\u2019ll find\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The surgeon\\u2019s grip on the scalpel tightened.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gunshots rang out in the distance as we entered the Brigadier\\u2019s lodge.\\xa0 The man was there, talking to some of his officers.\\xa0 Jamie, Helen, and Shipman were at the table, Helen bundled up, Jamie with a towel around his shoulders.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gordon handed the Brigadier the papers on Phlegmatic and Choleric.\\xa0 I hung back to see the Brigadier\\u2019s reaction and hear his response, while Mary and Lillian headed to rejoin the others.\\xa0 Lillian was smiling.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Something told me that if I hadn\\u2019t been there for the autopsy and analysis, Lillian wouldn\\u2019t have been a troublemaker.\\xa0 I\\u2019d rubbed off on her a little, and the surgeon had suffered for it.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGunshots,\\u201d Gordon observed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnother attack from the front,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re aware of the possibility that it\\u2019s a distraction.\\xa0 Guards are stationed elsewhere.\\xa0 We have eyes on all mineshafts and tunnels.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s too quiet,\\u201d I observed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The Brigadier gave me a curious look.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s almost timid, isn\\u2019t it?\\xa0 No explosions, only bullets.\\xa0 Getting our attention, but nothing more.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt <em>feels</em> like a distraction, rather than a proper attack.\\xa0 A handshake more than a ploy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe enemy\\u2019s shaking our hand?\\xa0 Explain.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I shook my head.\\xa0 \\u201cWe expected an attack to cover another attempt at getting an assassin inside our walls.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve answered that expectation.\\xa0 They might as well have a flag unfurled saying \\u2018distraction\\u2019, but that\\u2019s a communication of it\\u2019s own.\\xa0 That they know what we\\u2019re thinking.\\xa0 And because they know, they can meet us halfway.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey\\u2019re saying hi,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cTo <em>us</em> more than to the Brigadier.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve recognized that the style of leadership changed.\\xa0 The ambush, the assassin they tried to get inside didn\\u2019t make it and hasn\\u2019t given the signal they expected.\\xa0 The way the posts have a different distribution of guards.\\xa0 Something tipped them off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re acting like this is a game,\\u201d the Brigadier said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey have only a peripheral idea of who they\\u2019re dealing with.\\xa0 Same goes for us,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re feeling things out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The Brigadier looked at the commanders who he\\u2019d been talking to, and indicated for them to leave.\\xa0 He leaned against the front of his desk, arms and ankles folded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShould we expect this to continue?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey\\u2019re breaking from pattern, just as we are.\\xa0 It\\u2019s hard to say.\\xa0 Can we share this conversation with the others?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The Brigadier nodded.\\xa0 While Gordon and I rejoined the others, the man poured himself another drink.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThought exercise,\\u201d Gordon said, as we took our seats at the table.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you were on Whitney\\u2019s side, what would you do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m not a fighter,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cGive it a shot,\\u201d I prodded her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I could see her squirm a little, uncomfortable.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been <em>nice</em> to her recently, we\\u2019d had fun with the surgeon, and she was probably lonely after all of her weeks in the school, separated from most of the rest of us.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Now I was asking her to do something outside of her comfort zone.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cJamie and I were talking earlier tonight,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cLooking at the resources they have, how they might use them.\\xa0 Peralta specializes in pain.\\xa0 If the winds blew differently, or if they found a way to get further up into the hills, a vaporized spray to deploy a toxin could incapacitate us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe have masks,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 He\\u2019d joined us.\\xa0 Jamie had the papers Gordon had given the Brigadier.\\xa0 \\u201cEvery post, all of the men have their own individual masks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThere are a lot of vectors,\\u201d Shipman said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf it could be absorbed through the skin\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOr if it obscured sight,\\u201d Gordon added, \\u201cOr if having to wear the masks played a part in things?\\xa0 Limited vision, mist or smoke, assassins can creep in.\\xa0 It could be the trump card we were worried about.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cCould be,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I feel as if they\\u2019re a little more cohesive than that.\\xa0 This isn\\u2019t slapdash.\\xa0 They brought in people and those people are meeting and talking.\\xa0 They\\u2019re discussing, making a strategy, and that woman Cynthia is at the top, somehow.\\xa0 I think that their movements will be more in step.\\xa0 Not sending in an assassin without a mask on a city they intend to gas.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe assassin can steal a mask,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I made a gesture, indicating my lack of confidence, then remembered the Brigadier wouldn\\u2019t be familiar with it.\\xa0 Shipman either, for that matter.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t think so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAlright,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie?\\xa0 What do you think is coming?\\xa0 What would you do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019d continue to feel out the enemy.\\xa0 Go in with as much information as possible.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThen?\\u201d I jumped in.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThen attack.\\xa0 Keep the trump card in reserve.\\xa0 You said, uh, Sy said, that their biggest strength right now is how angry the people are.\\xa0 The soldiers are ready to kill because they don\\u2019t have any other choice.\\xa0 But that fighting spirit is easily broken.\\xa0 They throw themselves at these walls and gates enough times without a success, they\\u2019ll lose that fervor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAt which point they pull out the trump card,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie\\u2019s voice was soft, \\u201creignite the anger and the passion.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt would have to be something offensive,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMary, what would you do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Assassins</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUse the assassins,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey just lost their second.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou think they\\u2019ll throw good money after bad?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey\\u2019re <em>people</em>.\\xa0 They have feelings, and they just lost two of their own.\\xa0 Use the mineshafts, use the plague men, two assassins, and fight past any guards.\\xa0 Chaos in our camp, coinciding with another hard attack.\\xa0 Gun for our leadership, behead us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary paused, looking at the Brigadier.\\xa0 \\u201cSorry, sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The man was silent.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHelen?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen perked up a little.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat Mary said.\\xa0 But no gunning.\\xa0 Poison.\\xa0 Bombs.\\xa0 Traps.\\xa0 Get to the food supply, the meat lockers we use to feed the warbeasts and other experiments.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI kind of like that more, now that I hear it,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe attack from the inside sounds romantic in my head, but in execution\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI agree,\\u201d the Brigadier said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m more concerned about subtler attacks than a direct attack aimed at me and my immediate subordinates.\\xa0 We have people stationed as guards.\\xa0 We can maintain that guard, but I have to echo what I said to Sylvester earlier.\\xa0\\xa0 People can\\u2019t maintain that level of focus for too long a time.\\xa0 The mind and the heart won\\u2019t have it.\\xa0 Mistakes will be made, people will slack, convince themselves they can.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe condition of being human,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOne the enemy has to worry about,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s really the same problem they have with keeping the fires stoked, keeping the people hurt and mad.\\xa0 Which is really very easy, considering the spider thing.\\xa0 And the sterilization.\\xa0 And the leash.\\xa0 But it is a weak point for them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat are you thinking, Sy?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re the best to ask, when it comes to this sort of thing, I was saving you for last.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat Jamie said.\\xa0 We can expect another hour or two of harassment.\\xa0 Gunshots, maybe an explosion or two.\\xa0 But all this while, they\\u2019re going to be telling people, wait.\\xa0 Wait.\\xa0 <em>Wait.\\xa0</em> Get some rest.\\xa0 Be prepared.\\xa0 Because the <em>real</em> attack happens later.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gordon nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cThe first attack was a foray.\\xa0 They forced our hand.\\xa0 But they didn\\u2019t commit resources or show their own hand as they did it.\\xa0 A big stitched here, Sy\\u2019s rifleman with the eyes, too, but none of the weapons the scientists might have been working on.\\xa0 The second attack, with Choleric and stitched-Phlegm, that was only a small squad.\\xa0 This, right here, it\\u2019s a tease, a handshake, according to Sy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd while they\\u2019re holding our hand, and our guard is down, they use their other hand and slap us full across the face,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe next attack is going to be the decider.\\xa0 We\\u2019re gong to find out what the plague men are, and what the scientists have been working on.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe don\\u2019t seem to have a consensus,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut an indirect attack seems-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThey\\u2019re going to attack head-on,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFull-force.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The Brigadier paced over to the fire, holding his drink.\\xa0 We watched in silence as he paced for a moment.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He looked like he\\u2019d aged years over the course of the evening.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I wondered how old he <em>really</em> was.\\xa0 It was a hard question to answer sometimes.\\xa0 There were sixty year old women who maintained the appearance of someone a third their age.\\xa0 Brigadier Tylor was the opposite, in a way.\\xa0 Fitting, for someone who existed on the periphery.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He drew in a deep breath.\\xa0 He already had our full attention.\\xa0 \\u201cSylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cSir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYour fellows have been talking about all the possible vectors of attack.\\xa0 Including attacks from the flank, using special weapons, and attacks from within.\\xa0 There\\u2019s nothing we can do to block up mine shafts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYes, sir,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re anticipating a frontal attack.\\xa0 Why?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBecause they have no idea why the prior attack failed.\\xa0 We didn\\u2019t leave survivors to go back and report.\\xa0 As far as they know, the side roads are a deathtrap.\\xa0 They default to what they know and understand, and what they know is that the way is clear to the front.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThis current attack is a handshake, according to you.\\xa0 They know or assume our current organization was able to figure out their move with Phlegmatic and Choleric.\\xa0 What guarantee is there that they won\\u2019t change their plan here, in anticipation of a similar prediction?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s a fun question.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The Brigadier wasn\\u2019t smiling.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere\\u2019s no guarantee.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know her well enough to predict her.\\xa0 But when that woman Cynthia came after Jamie, Helen, and I, and Choleric signaled for her to back off, she was champing at the bit, and only barely restrained herself from coming after us.\\xa0 That\\u2019s the person in my mind when I picture them coming for us.\\xa0 A snarling dog in a pretty evening dress with pretty hair.\\xa0 Someone who knows types like Choleric and Phlegm, who arrives in town with the likes of Leopold Pock and Peralta.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe knows the dark underground of the Academies,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe disenfranchised, the monsters who\\u2019ve lurked under the radar and avoided the likes of Dog and Catcher.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I nodded.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou believe this firmly enough that you\\u2019d put the bulk of our defenses at the front doors?\\u201d the Brigadier asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot soon.\\xa0 Keep guards where they are.\\xa0 But I\\u2019d say that in about an hour, you\\u2019d want to start moving them to the front gate.\\xa0 Skeleton guards on other defenses.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The man turned back to the fire, then finished off his glass, which had only been one-quarter full to begin with.\\xa0 He placed the glass on the top of the hutch that held spare firewood.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019ll trust your read on her, but I\\u2019ll manage the distribution and logistics myself,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cProbably for the best, sir,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Didn\\u2019t want to lose him now.\\xa0 Hell, he was probably right.\\xa0 He did know better than I did.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019ve already told the others.\\xa0 After they let up this time, we press the attack,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">An attack against an unknown enemy.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe follow them home, right on their heels.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t keep playing this game.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t have the resources for it, and so long as they have the scientists and doctors, they\\u2019ll always have more tricks up their sleeve.\\xa0 We need to squash this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was silence in response to that, but we nodded as he looked back at us.\\xa0 The man mas serious.\\xa0 There was a bit of fire on our side, now.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I just wished it was better directed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We\\u2019d armed him with all the knowledge and perspective we could.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I was already planning and plotting, not just against our enemy, but trying to work with the man.\\xa0 I doubted he\\u2019d budge, and we had to follow him, or find a reason to make him change course.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThank you, for your counsel on the defense,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cJamie, I understand you have maps?\\xa0 Of Whitney, and the enemy positions

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/06/25/stitch-in-time-4-3/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>All things had hearts.\\xa0 All things had veins and arteries, tracks and paths which were carved through them as they acted out their role in life.\\xa0 Even a rock had its weakness, a point where a chisel and a strong enough blow could destroy it, as points of stress gave way.</p>\\n<p>Yeah, there were faint exceptions, but overall, it applied to many things in life.</p>\\n<p>It was an idea that might have seemed spiritual, but that wasn\\u2019t really where my line of thinking was coming from or going.\\xa0 Believing that all things had vulnerabilities <em>was</em> something central in my worldview, but I hesitated to call it faith.</p>\\n<p>The fact was, Kensford had a heart, and it had its arteries.\\xa0 Unlike Radham, the heart wasn\\u2019t the local Academy, but the main street downtown.\\xa0 Remove the Academy from the map, and the city would likely continue to function on a level, until the locals were called home by parents and patrons.\\xa0 Impede the downtown area, and things would quickly die, forced to divert and reroute through the winding streets of quaint little cottage-houses.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and I made our way downtown, then we began our explorations, taking every wrong turn.\\xa0 We found areas which hadn\\u2019t been kept up well, and places which helped keep Kensford alive: the local dump, teeming with lifeforms that would eat and live in the garbage, as well as boneyards, crematoriums, and warehouses.\\xa0 The layout of the city was ingenious, keeping the buildings out of sight, using the rise of hills and the winding streets to hide these places.</p>\\n<p>We visited two, to no effect, and then made our way to the nearby third, squeezing between two dormitory houses and hopping onto a fence.\\xa0 I walked along the top of the wooden fence, my hands in my pockets, while Gordon hopped up, walked three steps on the fence, then hopped down.</p>\\n<p>He wasn\\u2019t one for style and <em>panache.</em></p>\\n<p>The third area, hidden by the positions of the buildings and the little walls that sectioned off parts of Kensford, turned out to be a mass grave.</p>\\n<p>This was where experiments went when they failed.\\xa0 Humanoid, they were each distorted and misshapen, different features exaggerated or removed.\\xa0 They were piled on top of one another, most but not all naked and bound with straps, keeping arms close to the body and legs together.\\xa0 They had been dusted with some acid or lime or something in that vein, and flesh had melted, but only superficially, leaving the remains mummified.\\xa0 A light snow masked the worst of the scarring, the snow so thin that a feather might have wiped a given forehead or belly clean of it.</p>\\n<p>I could see the tracks where the wagon had turned up and dumped the latest collection of bodies.\\xa0 I suspected that one of the things I was smelling was that same batch of bodies.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWant to give them a shot?\\u201d Gordon asked, drawing my attention to a group of girls who were sitting on a large box that might have held salt for the street or lime for the bodies.\\xa0 They were just on the cusp of being proper adults, about nineteen, and their feet didn\\u2019t reach the ground.\\xa0 Each had a cigarette.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The girls made some surreptitious movements as we drew nearer, the rightmost girl taking something from the one in the middle, scooting closer to her friend, then reaching behind her back.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWeapon?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDrinking,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLook at their body language.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo we use it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we need to,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Do you want point?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll back you,\\u201d I said, while thinking,\\xa0 <em>I\\u2019m more flexible, I can adapt to fill the gaps in your approach better than you can adapt for me.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Besides,</em> I mentally revised, <em>You were entirely right in saying the group was splintering some.\\xa0 You and I aren\\u2019t any different.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not sure I trust you.</em></p>\\n<p>I hated myself for even thinking it, but Gordon had acted differently when around Shipman, and he\\u2019d nearly gotten us killed at one point.\\xa0 <em>All</em> of us were going to change to some degree as we entered into the next big segment of our lives, in body, mind, emotions, and how we fit into the group.</p>\\n<p>Or how we <em>didn\\u2019t.</em></p>\\n<p>Gordon, for all his talk about helping, was in the most danger of slipping away from the rest of us.</p>\\n<p>He could talk.\\xa0 I\\u2019d adapt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLittle boy,\\u201d the girl to the left said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou looked a lot older from a distance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi,\\u201d the middle girl said, clearly curious about us.</p>\\n<p>The leftmost girl didn\\u2019t seem to register the greetings, and added, \\u201cYou still have a bit of a baby face, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you have a drink hidden behind you,\\u201d he observed.\\xa0 His voice was even, calm, and nonthreatening.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m old enough to know that you\\u2019d get in trouble for that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That didn\\u2019t seem to go over well.\\xa0 The attitude shifted, mouths in firmer lines, body language adjusting to be more aggressive, sitting up straighter.</p>\\n<p>Subtlety wasn\\u2019t Gordon\\u2019s strong point either.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut,\\u201d Gordon said, \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to do that.\\xa0 I\\u2019m looking for information.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d upset them, but he wasn\\u2019t balancing it out with any bribe or possible reward.\\xa0 If I was jumping in to make the threats like Gordon had, I would have offered something to <em>gain</em>, to pull them further into my grasp and ensure they would do what I wanted them to do.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat information?\\u201d one of the girls asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait, wait,\\u201d the leftmost girl said.\\xa0 \\u201cWho are you, why are you here, and what are you doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was asking too many questions at once.\\xa0 The alcohol had made the words too loose.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m Gordon, that\\u2019s Sylvester.\\xa0 We\\u2019re trying to find some people, and we\\u2019re trying to find some people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She looked momentarily confused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHm,\\u201d the middle girl made a curious noise.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll take your bait.\\xa0 Which people?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe <em>other</em> sort of people that go to spots like this.\\xa0 Probably not students, either low-level laborers or the family of those laborers.\\xa0 Shady types,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd what does a kid like you want with that type of person?\\u201d the rightmost girl asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPoint us in the right direction if you want to find out,\\u201d Gordon said, smiling.</p>\\n<p>If <em>I\\xa0</em>had asked, she would have said no.</p>\\n<p>She smiled back.\\xa0 \\u201cI <em>am</em> curious.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Being attractive, being naturally smart, and naturally fit, Gordon had things <em>easy</em>.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t have to push as hard to achieve the same things.\\xa0 People liked him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou might be looking for the Baths?\\u201d the middle girl asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThere are four brothers and a girl, they drive in the wagons with supplies, three times a week.\\xa0 They get up to trouble.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow much trouble?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>The leftmost girl of the group reached back, grabbed a bottle and held it up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDrinking, more drinking, the occasional fight, making a lot of noise, which is probably the worst thing they do, having so many students living in Kensford,\\u201d the middle girl clarified.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd they do like the ladies,\\u201d the girl to the right said.\\xa0 She took the bottle and tipped back a mouthful.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere aren\\u2019t many young men around,\\u201d I observed.</p>\\n<p>The girl gave me a smile that was somewhere between smug and knowing.</p>\\n<p><em>Lucky guys</em>, I supposed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBaths.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a last name?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 When he got a nod in response, he asked, \\u201cAre they serious about their work?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMother Bath and Father Bath don\\u2019t mind what they do so long as the kids get the work done.\\xa0 They do, they\\u2019re religious about it.\\xa0 A day of work, a few hours a night of play.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s daytime right now,\\u201d Gordon observed.\\xa0 \\u201cHow long until they\\u2019re available?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The girls murmured among one another for a few seconds, then each one gave different answers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree hours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFive hours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFour hours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s too late,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWho else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cElse?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot the Bath family.\\xa0 Anyone else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are others, independent, people everyone knows to avoid.\\xa0 They\\u2019re not the sort of people kids like you should hang around.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d I cut in, before Gordon could forge onward.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey have a bit of a mean streak.\\xa0 Picking on the weak,\\u201d the middle girl said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd you\\u2019re weak.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere are they?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Again with the direct approach.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t the sort of thing I could have done, but Gordon almost sounded like an adult as he asked, and he managed the right body language and expression to drive the point home.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t tell you that, not in good conscience.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere are they?\\u201d he asked, again, more serious.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe woods,\\u201d the girl on the left said.\\xa0 The drunkest of the group.\\xa0 Still having trouble holding her tongue.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNear-\\u201d the girl started to reply.\\xa0 Her friend in the middle clapped a hand over her mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNear the school,\\u201d I guessed.\\xa0 Most obvious possibility.</p>\\n<p>The looks on their faces told me I was right.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA little to the west?\\u201d I tried.\\xa0 With the school bordered on two sides by thick woodland, there were only two possible directions that weren\\u2019t \\u2018into the woods\\u2019.\\xa0 Being right had the \\u2018wow\\u2019 factor, but I figured out the answer either way.\\xa0 Probably.</p>\\n<p>Again, I was right.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Gordon.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow did you do that?\\u201d the drunk girl asked, behind me.</p>\\n<p>The second of the girls, the one from the middle, hopped down behind me.\\xa0 I turned just in time to see her grab for my coat.\\xa0 I tried to avoid her hand, and missed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not going in the woods,\\u201d she said, voice firm.</p>\\n<p>I was betting she was an older sister.</p>\\n<p>Gordon started to approach, no doubt to break her hold.\\xa0 For my part, I reached into my coat and withdrew a knife, raising it toward her wrist.</p>\\n<p>She let go of me as if I were on fire.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can handle ourselves,\\u201d Gordon said, in the same confident, mild manner of speaking he\\u2019d used to talk to them earlier.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you want to come and make sure we\\u2019re safe, feel free, but don\\u2019t get in the way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We circled around the mass grave, making our way toward the woods at the north end of Kensford, west of the Academy at the northeast corner of the town, and the girls didn\\u2019t follow.</p>\\n<p>When we were out of earshot, I commented, \\u201cThat was a shame.\\xa0 We could have used them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey would have held us back, or complained.\\xa0 They\\u2019re not what we\\u2019re looking for.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I agreed.</p>\\n<p>People with a mean streak sounded good.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We\\u2019d done this before.\\xa0 Found a group of malcontents, then steered them in a given direction.\\xa0 They worked well as distractions, as sources of information, or sources of <em>tools</em>, an extra set of hands for getting things done.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gordon was generally good at getting their attention.\\xa0 I was good when it came to the steering.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We hadn\\u2019t run into <em>this</em> before.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">They were, by and large, <em>girls</em>.\\xa0 They were eighteen to nineteen, dressed in winter clothes, they sat around a large bonfire, their backs to a shack that had another fire going in a stove or fireplace within.\\xa0 A group of the girl\\u2019s pets were hacking away at trees, gathering more firewood for the bonfire.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">At the center of it all was a girl with her hair in disarray, slouching forward on a log, elbows on her knees.\\xa0 Her jacket looked like some kind of new fashion that had yet to take off; it sported a surprising number of black feathers around the collar.\\xa0 She\\u2019d had some alterations done to her face and nails, giving one of her her cheekbones and eye sockets a peculiar sort of edge to them, her upper face looking like a stylized skull was trying to push its\\xa0 way out and forward from one corner of her face.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She wasn\\u2019t the only one who had gone to an extreme and modified herself, and as a result, there was no particular sign she was special, going by appearance and attitude alone.\\xa0 There was only the fact that, when we arrived, and the girls looked at each other in surprise, they looked <em>to</em> the black feathered woman for a response.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou usually pick a fight and win,\\u201d I murmured.\\xa0 \\u201cYou want to fight <em>them</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019m not shy to fight a woman.\\xa0 We can do this like we always do.\\xa0 I propose a challenge, or see if they\\u2019re betting types.\\xa0 Let them pick the contest, hope they pick <em>fighting</em><em>, </em>for me, or a gambling game for you to cheat at, beat them, whatever they choose.\\xa0 Use that to get them to listen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d I agreed, \\u201cDifference is, you\\u2019re not going to \\u2018win\\u2019 if you win.\\xa0 Nobody will respect a boy who beats a girl.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHm,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey <em>might.</em>\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNah.\\xa0 Let me lead here?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He gestured in my direction.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAren\\u2019t many kids hereabouts,\\u201d the woman with the black feathered coat said.\\xa0 She was faking an Eastern-Crown accent, which I found <em>very</em> interesting.\\xa0 It was all of the crispness of Crown English coupled with too much enunciating.\\xa0 The fakery of it was obvious enough I suspected some of others in this group of hers knew it wasn\\u2019t how she <em>really</em> talked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Why, then?</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Image?</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019re not from hereabouts,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re visiting from Radham.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAll the way from Radham to <em>here</em>?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Tots</em> don\\u2019t often come to Kensford.\\xa0 Less than ten in the city, I\\u2019d wager.\\xa0 Children of shopkeeps or teachers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThere are a few more now,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 My gaze passed over every person here, trying to piece the puzzle together.\\xa0 Who were these young ladies, and why were they here?</p>\\n<p>Dark circles under eyes, scars in and on the webbing between fingers, a generally dejected, angry air, with some drastic personal modifications that were guaranteed to run afoul of the school, even without the dress code, and the proximity of this little encampment to the larger school was pretty telling.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The pieces snapped into place.</p>\\n<p>I had an idea of who they were and how they functioned, now.</p>\\n<p>But first things first\\u2026</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019re looking for someone,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s a criminal, and the very first thing I have to ask is whether anyone came to you and asked about <em>children</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhich children?\\xa0 <em>Having</em> children?\\u201d the woman in the black feathered coat asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cLooking for <em>us</em>,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 It was cutting a little too close to the chase, but I was feeling impatient.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She didn\\u2019t respond, and only stared.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I knew this tactic.\\xa0 I\\u2019d <em>used</em> this tactic.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Yet she\\u2019d played dumb, just a bit, she had baited an answer out of me, and now she was leaving me hanging.\\xa0 That I hadn\\u2019t had a better response to each step of her play was grating.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>You want to play that game?</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe haven\\u2019t been here for long,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t break eye contact as I talked, staring, \\u201cBut I do know that Dame Cicely\\u2019s has a strict curriculum, with an awful lot of students who are willing to hurt or sabotage others if it means rising to the top.\\xa0 I\\u2019m even betting that some of you have done it.\\xa0 Except you <em>failed</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I saw the reactions, and I marked the faces in question, the black-feathered woman\\u2019s in particular.\\xa0 The bullies, the vicious ones who\\u2019d hurt others.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou <em>collectively </em>failed,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re <em>here</em> because you\\u2019re not part of the school anymore.\\xa0 You hit your limit, you didn\\u2019t get the grades, or you were dropped from the roster.\\xa0 Maybe your parents don\\u2019t know.\\xa0 Maybe they\\u2019re picking you up soon.\\xa0 You have a limited time, and there aren\\u2019t many roads open to you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI do think\\u2026\\u201d the woman in the black-feathered coat said, drawing out the words, pausing for effect, \\u201c\\u2026I\\u2019m done listening to you.\\xa0 Scurry off, little one.\\xa0 I\\u2019m feeling kind today.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe\\u2019re not going anywhere,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cFeeling less kind, now,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Right.\\xa0 Picking on the weak.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She stood from the log she was using as a bench, dusting snow off her backside.\\xa0 She was fascinating to look at, in terms of the sheer <em>analysis</em> I could do.\\xa0 All the girls and women I\\u2019d met had been told how to act and how to dress, how to say things and how to <em>be</em>.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Out of those girls and women, there had been scarce few who had broken from that mold.\\xa0 Of those, there were a number of monsters, and there were a number of people who had been absolutely and totally broken.\\xa0 Slaves, prisoners, and test subjects.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Then there were maybe one or two sexual inverts, but this woman didn\\u2019t strike me as one.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She\\u2019d been torn down, and she\\u2019d built herself back up, and it was a ramshackle, unwieldy sort of build, as her accent suggested.\\xa0 She walked with less grace than many <em>men</em> I knew.</p>\\n<p>She drew nearer.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t move.</p>\\n<p>She reached for me, and Gordon moved to intercept, grabbing her wrist.</p>\\n<p>Looking at her palm, I saw something move.\\xa0 Pink, tiny, and round, they looked like pimples, but they throbbed, skin stretching tighter as they moved.</p>\\n<p>I hurried in stepping to one side, while Gordon held her wrist to keep her hand from following me.</p>\\n<p>A pale mist spurted out to form a two-foot round cloud in front of her hand.\\xa0 My head was well out of the way</p>\\n<p>She tore her wrist free of Gordon\\u2019s grip.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSomething about you two seems wrong,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe way you talk, the way you move\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>That goes both ways,</em> I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re talking about <em>you</em>, not us,\\u201d I told her, \\u201cYou\\u2019re out of options, all of you.\\xa0 You\\u2019re having a last hurrah before your families come to collect you or outright disown you.\\xa0 You had one chance to make something of yourself that wasn\\u2019t being a teacher or a housewife, and you <em>failed</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m still in a position to hurt you,\\u201d she threatened.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m in a position to stop you,\\u201d Gordon said, behind her.</p>\\n<p>She stepped back to keep us all in view, while also making sure that we were between her and the others.\\xa0 Gordon and I didn\\u2019t flinch.</p>\\n<p>Sore spot.\\xa0 She wore the wound like a badge, and she was no doubt used to hurting anyone who prodded it.\\xa0 Angry, spiteful, lashing out.\\xa0 She wore it all right out in the open.</p>\\n<p>And, I imagined, the others flocked to her because they identified so heavily with it.</p>\\n<p>This wasn\\u2019t a group like Reverend Mauer had been trying to make, something that might have endured and carried on forever.\\xa0 This was a group that would self destruct any day now.</p>\\n<p>It was beautiful in its bitterness.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to keep this simple, and I\\u2019m going to keep it short,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re here because we want to offer you an opportunity.\\xa0 You have very few opportunities.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOpportunities,\\u201d she said, sounding less than enthused.</p>\\n<p>Gordon shrugged.\\xa0 \\u201cYou became Academy students because it\\u2019s the fastest, easiest way to rise up in society and get out from under thumbs.\\xa0 Now I\\u2019m going to offer you <em>another</em> way that\\u2019s fast and easy.\\xa0 Money.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow much?\\u201d she asked, without wasting a heartbeat\\u2019s time.</p>\\n<p>I jumped in, wasting no time either, wording things so I had a half-second to think. \\xa0There were eight people in her little group. \\u201cEnough that, if you split it three ways, three people could buy houses in a decent enough town.\\xa0 Split it more ways, it still buys some time to figure out a way forward.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMoney makes the world go around,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd at the end of the day, even the Academy needs money and resources to keep going.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The woman frowned, looking at each of us.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd how are you going to get us that much money?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re looking for a person,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s tricky, because it\\u2019s a girl with a pet monster, and I do know there are a lot of girls with pet monsters around.\\xa0 Her pet <em>was</em> a disembodied head, but we\\u2019re not sure what it is now, and she could have changed her appearance.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes she have a bounty on her head?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot officially, but she\\u2019s committed major offenses against the Crown in two of the Crown States.\\xa0 That puts a certain price on her head.\\xa0 You get her, dead or alive, and then you point out the rule, deliver the body, and you\\u2019re made.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere do you come in?\\u201d she asked.\\xa0 \\u201cTwo little boys in the wrong place, doing and knowing things you shouldn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re your salvation,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe don\\u2019t need or want the money.\\xa0 We want her <em>caught, </em>or we want her <em>dead</em>.\\xa0 That\\u2019s all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to say yes,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you want to keep pretending you won\\u2019t, or can we use this time to talk details, with Sylvester and me -I\\u2019m Gordon, by the by- telling you what little we know about her?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think I\\u2019m going to say yes, because I don\\u2019t have anything better to do?\\xa0 Maybe we\\u2019re done with people telling us how we should live our lives.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd maybe this is the last real <em>choice</em>.\\xa0 Your last chance, ever, to choose the course of your own life.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She ruminated for a long moment.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRonnie,\\u201d one of the other girls said.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ronnie, the woman with the black feathered coat, bowed her head a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re angry,\\u201d I said, my voice soft.\\xa0 \\u201cAngry at the world.\\xa0 This girl we\\u2019re after, she\\u2019s a good target for that anger.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Was there really as much choice as we\\u2019d implied?</p>\\n<p>She nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow many people do you think you could round up?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTwelve at least,\\u201d she said, raising her head.\\xa0 \\u201cTwenty at most.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Twenty is a good number</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Here\\u2019s what you need to know,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s not a student, and she probably doesn\\u2019t have student identification.\\xa0 She has or <em>had</em> black hair, favors ruby red lipstick, was in the company of a young stitched woman and a head\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The others were waiting as Gordon and I met at the house.\\xa0 I tried to gauge how the others were doing, if they were closer or further apart than they\\u2019d been before Gordon had grouped them up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen and Lillian seemed fine.\\xa0 Jamie and Mary far less so.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhere do we stand?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe talked to the faculty,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThere have been thefts of supplies.\\xa0 She set up a lab, and she might be reluctant to abandon it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe\\u2019s set up others,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe abandoned those.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Lillian frowned.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI recognized the equipment,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cVat grown life, big and equipment necessary for working with microscopic life.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cTogether?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnything else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen shook her head.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cJamie, Mary?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe looked through the crowds,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf she\\u2019s hiding in plain sight, she might be hiding among larger numbers.\\xa0 If I can get a good look at her, I\\u2019ll be able to identify her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis many pretty girls around,\\u201d Mary said, \\u201cSomeone\\u2019s doing back-street work, touching up and prettifying.\\xa0 That same someone might have changed Ms. Fray\\u2019s face or hair for her.\\xa0 We asked around, I think we might keep it up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>They didn\\u2019t stay together.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou need to stay together as a pair,\\u201d Gordon said, voicing my thoughts aloud.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe did, some,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe stayed close enough we could see each other, at least.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd if she comes after you in the crowd?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat might not be how she operates,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut it <em>could</em> be,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded in agreement.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat did you manage?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve got eighteen people on the ground,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMalcontents and criminals.\\xa0 We\\u2019re going to put word out with a few others.\\xa0 Local thugs.\\xa0 Every town has it\\u2019s common elements, and one of those elements is that there are people who aren\\u2019t happy, looking for an easy fix.\\xa0 They\\u2019re covering the common exits from the city and making sure Fray can\\u2019t run, if she\\u2019s still here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know Gordon likes to do things the direct way,\\u201d Jamie said, \\u201cBut <em>you</em>, Sy?\\xa0 What\\u2019s the plot in your head right now?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlotting?\\xa0 I\\u2019m offended!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie didn\\u2019t even blink.</p>\\n<p>I sighed.\\xa0 \\u201cThe people we\\u2019re sending after Fray, they\\u2019re floundering, drowning, struggling to make it in life.\\xa0 I\\u2019m interested to see how she interacts with them.\\xa0 It\\u2019s very possible she might <em>recruit</em> them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich is good, somehow?\\u201d Mary guessed.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cInsert a weak link that we can then sever at the right time.\\xa0 And those women <em>are</em> weak links.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDangerous game,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 I detected a note of disapproval in his voice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s one I\\u2019m confident playing,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cAt the very least, they\\u2019ll keep her on her back foot, make her deal with the people who are asking questions and cutting off her retreat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were a few nods.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe eat, hit the washrooms, change clothes if we need to, then move out again,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He looked at Jamie and Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cSame teams, please.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie and Mary nodded.</p>\\n<p>As we headed for the front door of the house, I inserted myself between Jamie and Mary.\\xa0 Two of my favorite people, for very different reasons.\\xa0 My oldest friend and my newest.</p>\\n<p>How to tie them closer together?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re both methodical,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat you do, you do <em>perfectly</em>, whether it\\u2019s sticking a knife in between someone\\u2019s ribs or remembering the exact text of a book you read a year ago.\\xa0 Think about what puts the two of you on the same page.\\xa0 <em>Use</em> that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re both fond of you,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, that\\u2019s a cop out answer,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re all fond of each other, aren\\u2019t we?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary smiled at that.\\xa0 The inclusion.\\xa0 Even now, three quarters of a year after joining us, she needed the reminder that she was a dyed in the wool Lamb.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re okay,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe were figuring it out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI only\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I trailed off.</p>\\n<p>Gordon had opened the door.</p>\\n<p>He stepped back out of the way.</p>\\n<p>Our belongings were in ruins.\\xa0 The luggage destroyed, the contents torn up and strewn around.\\xa0 Entire sections of the little dormitory house had been torn up and ripped out, including the kitchen sink, by the looks of it.</p>\\n<p>But, worst of all, was the blood.\\xa0 At least three whelps had been torn to pieces and the contents had been used to paint the hallway.</p>\\n<p>The bloody handprint on the wall was at least two feet across.</p>\\n<p>A message was written on the wall in blood.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">I have your <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">real</span> pills.</p>\\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">\\xa0 -G.

there any way to tell?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTaste?\\u201d Jamie suggested.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTaste it, then,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut there\\u2019s no guarantees.\\xa0 We can\\u2019t afford to think we\\u2019re safe and be wrong.\\xa0 She\\u2019s <em>here</em>, she\\u2019s challenging us\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd if she knows we\\u2019re staying <em>here</em>, then she\\u2019s

hopefully.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt would be nice,\\u201d I said, crouching down to sit on my heels, prodding at one of the dead whelps.\\xa0 It had a large beak and scaled body, it sported a long tail and narrow eyes.\\xa0 The tongue trailed out of its open mouth.\\xa0 I added, \\u201cMy hopes aren\\u2019t high.\\xa0 She\\u2019s been one step ahead for a while.\\xa0 I doubt the Whelps are going to catch her off guard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I stroked the thing\\u2019s side.\\xa0 It was small compared to the others, I gauged it at twenty pounds, give or

said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cIf they possibly messed with the pills, we can\\u2019t rule out that they messed with the stuff they left on the

said.</p>\\n<p>Mary made her way back, standing beside Gordon.\\xa0 Between all of us, we\\u2019d formed a loose perimeter around the mess that had been left behind with the demise of the Whelps.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPerimeter\\u2019s clear,\\u201d Mary said, a touch late.\\xa0 Filling the silence rather than promptly reporting in.\\xa0 \\u201cNothing and nobody outside that I can tell.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSmall building, fast check,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat are we thinking?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re dealing with a Sylvester that has a lot more general knowledge, less compunctions, and the upper hand,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe can\\u2019t pee standing up, so that\\u2019s a point for me,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian punched me in the arm again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOw!\\xa0 <em>Why?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is serious.\\xa0 Be serious,\\u201d she admonished me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere was no stamp on the parcel, she would have had to know there would be a parcel arriving by mail with a <em>guard</em>, and she would have had to fabricate any fake pills in advance,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe would have had to know we were coming, or that <em>someone</em> was coming,\\u201d Jamie pointed out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said, holding my tongue as I thought, <em>the armed mail carriage wouldn\\u2019t have been the most subtle thing for a paranoid ex-Doctor, and she was expecting someone.</em></p>\\n<p>Helen held up the bottle of pills, so they caught the light.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSealed,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGimme?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it\\u2019s poison-\\u201d I warned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust gimme,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>Helen unsealed the bottle, removed the glass stopper, then reached in to get a pill.\\xa0 She threw it to me.</p>\\n<p>I caught it and handed it to Jamie.</p>\\n<p>He popped it into his mouth.\\xa0 \\u201cTastes exactly the same.\\xa0 Like chalk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll signs point to it being nothing more than head games,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said, for the fourth time.</p>\\n<p>The silence lingered.\\xa0 Nobody was saying what we were all thinking.\\xa0 We could <em>say</em> all we wanted, but our heads knew different.</p>\\n<p>Fray was <em>smart, </em>and she was <em>clever</em>, which were two very different things.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t beyond the realm of possibility, and when our lives were at stake\\u2026</p>\\n<p>I said it, because nobody else seemed willing to, \\u201cWe\\u2019re not really in a position to take a leap of faith here.\\xa0 Guessing wrong before we leap means a terminal fall.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Nobody said anything to that.\\xa0 It was sobering.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that it?\\u201d Mary asked, indignant.\\xa0 \\u201cWe pack up, use the badges, and force our way onto the next train ride back?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s the safest option,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian, you were briefed on the particulars of the drug, weren\\u2019t you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey filled me in before we left.\\xa0 What to expect when you showed symptoms, how to handle it.\\xa0 If we left tonight, assuming a two hour train journey to Radham, one or two brief stops, I don\\u2019t think there would be any major symptoms.\\xa0 You\\u2019d feel like you had the flu, at worst.\\xa0 I could alleviate symptoms, which would delay the deterioration.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDying,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you want to be blunt about it,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 The look in her eyes when she looked at me was <em>steely</em>.\\xa0 Her tone was cold, and she spoke with a kind of authority.</p>\\n<p>Our lives were in her hands, as they so often were, but right here, right now, with <em>all</em> of us in grave peril, well, this was Lillian\\u2019s moment.</p>\\n<p>She fixed the position of her bags, betraying the nervousness behind the guise.\\xa0 \\u201cWhen you start throwing up, the other parts of you that are breaking down will tear and rip.\\xa0 Your stomach and throat will bleed, your muscles will rip, and you\\u2019ll be incapacitated by cramps.\\xa0 The blood that drains into your stomach will make you throw up more.\\xa0 By that point in time, every hour that passes adds a <em>month </em>to the time it would take you to recover.\\xa0 And that\\u2019s with Academy help, and it assumes you\\u2019re taking the pills again.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon looked at me.\\xa0 \\u201cYou ran away once.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s ears perked up at that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDidn\\u2019t leave Radham.\\xa0 Couldn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Planned to, but the opportunities never came up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat opportunities would that be?\\u201d Gordon asked, a half-smile on his face, \\u201cWere you going to get classified as a war machine so they wean you off the leash, and somehow pass yourself off without getting caught by Dog and Catcher?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen tittered, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a funny mental image.\\xa0 Big hulking warbeast, check.\\xa0 Big hulking warbeast, check.\\xa0 Big hulking warbeast, check.\\xa0 Then there\\u2019s Sy, standing in the stable, fake horns on his head.\\xa0 Check.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen the actual medication comes in,\\u201d I said, \\u201cIn the form of a three gallon syringe, to be jabbed into my tiny ass.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were a few smiles at that, breaking the tension.</p>\\n<p>Good.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn seriousness, my vampire bat plan was sort of like that,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The half-smile dropped off Gordon\\u2019s face.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat?\\xa0 You\\u2019re serious.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSort of,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI needed a good back-alley doctor to help me figure out the particulars, stuff to watch out for, get the tools, but if I stole the blood of something that was being weaned off and getting the drugs that eased the transition, then gave it to myself?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you gave me a week, I couldn\\u2019t list all the reasons that wouldn\\u2019t work,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut,\\u201d I said, \\u201cI could get the drugs that way, if there wasn\\u2019t any other option, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019d kill yourself.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut I\\u2019d have the drugs,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Lillian frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny war machine that\\u2019s getting weaned off the Academy\\u2019s leash-drugs isn\\u2019t going to put up much of a fight if I happened to slip into its enclosure.\\xa0 Maybe I could have found someone to reverse engineer the drug.\\xa0 Maybe there could be a filter.\\xa0 Centrifuge thing, if the drug is heavy enough?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, Sy,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI can\\u2019t imagine that working.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t know that you did that,\\u201d Mary commented, voice soft.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not proud of it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s very <em>you.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou got caught, in the end?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI let myself get caught,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cStayed in Radham, reached my limit, and when Dog and Catcher came sniffing around, I didn\\u2019t try to fight them.\\xa0 Stayed put as Catcher came into the building, didn\\u2019t budge as Catcher came to cuff me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI missed the others.\\xa0 Being with them on the Academy\\u2019s terms was better than being without, on mine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.\\xa0 It was a reply she understood.\\xa0 The others gave me small smiles or nods of understanding \\u2013 Gordon, Helen, even Lillian.</p>\\n<p>Jamie was the only one who didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 Who knew that I was telling a half truth.\\xa0 Or, more correctly, I was telling half of the truth.</p>\\n<p>Yes, I had gone back for the others.</p>\\n<p>But I had also gone back for my appointments.\\xa0 I had allowed the Academy to poison my brain once again, with my body suffering as a side effect, and I\\u2019d done it because I\\u2019d missed being <em>sharp</em>.</p>\\n<p>Two appointments in short succession.\\xa0 It had been so difficult I very nearly hadn\\u2019t come back from it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Vampire bat</em> plan?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas this one of <em>multiple</em> plans?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid you have other plans you intended to use then, which might apply today?\\xa0 Ways to prolong the deadline?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOne.\\xa0 But it won\\u2019t make us any friends.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShare?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSimple.\\xa0 We take someone else\\u2019s.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat depends on there being someone from Radham here, using an experiment,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhelps don\\u2019t count.\\xa0 They\\u2019re weaned.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a long shot.\\xa0 But it\\u2019s a long shot in favor of having another shot at her, while she\\u2019s playing games with us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI want to <em>win</em>,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m with Mary on this one,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a stupid trick, faking us out on the pills, but she\\u2019s out-predicted us a few too many times, staying ahead of the Lambs, Hangman and Dog and Catcher.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t feel safe calling her on what seems to be a shitty bluff.\\xa0 I\\u2019m angry, I want to win and rub it in her face.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI agree,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He pushed his oversized glasses up his nose.\\xa0 \\u201cBut we do this <em>safely</em>.\\xa0 If we have to catch a train tonight to get back in time, then we have until tonight.\\xa0 That\\u2019s only a few more hours.\\xa0 We need to find leads on Fray, figure out if there\\u2019s a way to get a legitimate source for pills, and watch our backs at the same time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEasy peasy,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not so sure,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut I\\u2019d like to give this a shot, at least.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>United in crisis.</p>\\n<p>We were on more solid footing than we had been.</p>\\n<p>It made me wonder.\\xa0 If the positions were reversed, me in Fray\\u2019s shoes and vice-versa, would I have been able to get a good reading on my adversary?\\xa0 Would I know that the Lambs were fractured and falling apart?\\xa0 That attacking them directly would rally them, while running away for the Nth time threatened to break them?</p>\\n<p>Fray was an invisible woman.\\xa0 I knew her only by the maneuvers she\\u2019d made against us, the cities she chose to flee to, and the way she fled.</p>\\n<p>Jamie stepped forward.\\xa0 He traced his finger along the edge of the bloody handprint on the wall.</p>\\n<p>Gordon commented, \\u201cShe wants us to come after her.\\xa0 This is a trap.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo is going home,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe leave, she probably won\\u2019t extend another invitation to us again.\\xa0 Makes me think\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I trailed off, uncomfortable.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThink what?\\u201d\\xa0 Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cIncomplete thought.\\xa0 I\\u2019ll speak up the moment it\\u2019s put together in my head.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGoing by handprint and footprint, I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve seen anything that would fit the size of this guy,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGuy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.\\xa0 He pointed at the marks on the floor.\\xa0 Not at <em>blood</em>.\\xa0 The attackers weren\\u2019t so messy.\\xa0 But at scuff marks, dust, and spots where dust was mottled.\\xa0 \\u201cMan.\\xa0 He had a lot of snow on him.\\xa0 Kicked up, and he\\u2019d been standing in the snow.\\xa0 It fell off in clumps, hit the floor, dappled the texture of the dust there.\\xa0 Our assailant.\\xa0 The head, now with a body.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The finger moved to the floor to one side.\\xa0 \\u201cHard to see now, because Mary walked on it, but I remember it as it was.\\xa0 Young woman.\\xa0 Lightweight.\\xa0 Tall, slender, not heavily dressed.\\xa0 Odd gait.\\xa0 Limp.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe stitched woman,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo Fray?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>Jamie shook his head.</p>\\n<p>Interesting.</p>\\n<p>She sent her underlings on a mission, but what had she been doing in the meantime?</p>\\n<p>Why was she staying with us?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a starting point,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cNow, I\\u2019ve really got to visit the little boy\\u2019s room.\\xa0 Then we really should get going.\\xa0 We\\u2019re working with a clock.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I liked the looks on people\\u2019s faces as they transitioned from being <em>children</em> to being Lambs in their element.\\xa0 Being more anxious, or less.\\xa0 Expressions changing, minds switching gears.</p>\\n<p>Jamie elbowed me.\\xa0 Then he pointed at the door.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>We excused ourselves and stepped outside.\\xa0 My eyes roved over the storybook town, looking to see if I could spy Fray spying on us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen you came back, you didn\\u2019t do it purely because of us,\\u201d Jamie murmured.</p>\\n<p>I bumped his arm with my shoulder.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s weird when you do that.\\xa0 Pick up a thread of conversation that we dropped a while back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re dodging the question.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStatement, not a question, Mr. Perfect Memory.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Implied</em> question, Mr. Tiny Ass.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I stabbed a finger toward his face.\\xa0 \\u201cCareful.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re still dodging.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah, sure,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t the only reason.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve hinted at it before.\\xa0 Do I have to say it, or will you admit it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shrugged, \\u201cSame thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou came back because you wanted to be a Lamb, not a real boy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, not looking at him, but at all of the smoke pouring up from the chimneys of the oddly similar little buildings.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat if Fray is the same?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe wants to be a Lamb?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe wants the excitement.\\xa0 She wants to have a brain that works differently than most, and she wants to <em>test</em> it.\\xa0 She\\u2019s been running for so long, she\\u2019s getting <em>bored</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t buy it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSerial killers do it.\\xa0 They develop a pattern, based on who they are and how they function.\\xa0 They test the limits, they get away with it, but as humans, we all have a drive to be appreciated and recognized.\\xa0 We need <em>stimulus.\\xa0 </em>I doubt Fray is going to sit down and read a book any more than you are.\\xa0 She\\u2019s looking to us to satisfy a desire.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, sorry,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI respect that you\\u2019ve put a lot of thought into it, but\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 It\\u2019s too convenient.\\xa0 Her, suddenly developing a weakness, right here, when we need her to?\\xa0 The thing with the pills, to throw us off balance?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think it\\u2019s a trap.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d rather go up against her assuming that she didn\\u2019t have any weaknesses at all,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI feel like anything else would be a mistake.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie nodded.\\xa0 The snow continued to fall around us.\\xa0 I heard Gordon coming down the stairs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you saying that,\\u201d Jamie said, with a careful sort of deliberation, \\u201cbecause you think Fray is that good?\\xa0 Or are you saying it because you <em>want</em> to think she\\u2019s that good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think I need that stimulus you were just talking about?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>Jamie shrugged.</p>\\n<p>I bumped his arm with my shoulder.\\xa0 He returned the favor, hard enough that I lost my footing, going wide off the stairs leading up to the front door and putting my foot into a bush.</p>\\n<p>I was only just managing to pull my foot free, cursing Jamie, when the others emerged.</p>\\n<p>All of the Lambs together and ready.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">A secondary source of pills disarmed Fray\\u2019s ruse.\\xa0 It was something of a priority.\\xa0 We moved as a group, now, holding something of a formation.\\xa0 Jamie\\u2019s eyes scanned the crowd, Mary had one flank, Gordon had another, and Helen had the front of the group.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cPost office, three buildings down this street,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the approach?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe can do it quick, we can do it pretty, and we can do it careful,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cPick two.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI\\u2019d prefer-\\u201d Gordon started.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat was a rhetorical question,\\u201d I cut him off.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou\\u2019re a jackass.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWe do it quick, we do it careful.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t want to waste time, and we\\u2019re going to watch our backs every step of the way.\\xa0 We\\u2019re not making friends today.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve already scattered a handful of delinquents around the town, and the only <em>pretty</em> way to get the pills we need is to go home.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think <em>any</em> of us want to go home, do we?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There were a few grumbles and murmurs of agreement.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201c<em>I</em> want to go home,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cToo bad,\\u201d I said, before her mouth was closed. \\u201cHelen takes point on this one.\\xa0 She\\u2019s pretty enough to make up for what we\\u2019re lacking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOh yay!\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd thank you!\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMary, get the back door.\\xa0 Gordon, cover any bystanders, watch the front door.\\xa0 Jamie, I think there was a window.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThere was.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWatch for bystanders.\\xa0 Keep an eye on the crowd.\\xa0 Fray is going to want to watch what our next moves are, so soon after the little stunt she pulled.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd me?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIf we need your help, something\\u2019s gone horribly wrong,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I saw movement in one of the alleyways.\\xa0 Whelps.\\xa0 Three.\\xa0 All larger than the runt I\\u2019d said hi to.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">They were, as a weapon, a singular entity.\\xa0 They weren\\u2019t joined by the brain or anything like that, but they <em>were</em> cloned, making them functionally identical, differing only in minor ways as their environment and exposure to food allowed.\\xa0 One whelp alone could divide into two.\\xa0 Left alone, they would stalk their prey from a distance, eat things that didn\\u2019t smell of human, including foodstuffs recently handled by humans, multiply, and then when they had built up sufficient numbers, they would attack en masse.\\xa0 Those beaks would cut into flesh and flense it from bone.\\xa0 Ten whelps could devour a man in less than a minute.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">They had her scent, our delinquents had the exits covered.\\xa0 By all rights, our quarry should have been cornered and under pressure.\\xa0 I fully expected her to take down the delinquents with her\\u2026</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOh guys,\\u201d I said, interrupting my own train of thought.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWhat?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHeadsman?\\xa0 For the head, now with body.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cEhhh,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s great!\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cEhhhh,\\u201d he said, again.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYou lack taste,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I picked up my own train of thought before it ran away from me.\\xa0 Fray most definitely had the tools to take down any of the delinquents we\\u2019d put in her way.\\xa0 My only hope was that there would be enough of a mess or commotion to clue us in to what she was doing.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Many of those delinquents had pets and creations of their own, after all.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t likely to be <em>tidy</em> when she disposed of them.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We approached the post office.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cMail would have come in with the train,\\u201d Jamie observed.\\xa0 \\u201cNot all of it would have been picked up.\\xa0 I can\\u2019t think of a better, faster way to check what we need to check.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWill you give me a boost, Mary?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNow?\\xa0 Where?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIn a few seconds, silly,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Inside.</em>\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cUm,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cPlay along,\\u201d I encouraged her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gordon was taking long strides forward to beat us to the door.\\xa0 Ever the gentleman, he held it for the ladies as they stepped inside first.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The building was empty.\\xa0 Fortuitous.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAh, hello again,\\u201d the postman said.\\xa0 \\u201cLittle lady.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHello!\\u201d Helen greeted him.\\xa0 She gestured at Mary, who connected the dots <em>just</em> in time for Helen.\\xa0 She offered two hands, fingers interlaced.\\xa0 Helen stepped up onto the hands, then onto the counter of the post office.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cExcuse me!\\u201d the postman said, looking alarmed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen simply strode forward, hooked an arm around his neck, swinging around behind him, and wrapped her legs around his arms, pinning them to his sides.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He struggled, and he was a big fellow, almost capable of freeing himself, but her grip on his neck tightened.\\xa0 He backed up, slamming her against the wall and shelf behind them, but she simply redoubled her attack.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary and I both hopped over the counter, Mary\\u2019s skirt swishing around stockinged legs.\\xa0 Gordon was locking the door, pulling down the blind above the glass pane, while Jamie stood by the window, peering out.\\xa0 Mary went to the back door, locking it, while I started looking.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Behind the desk was a grid of mail slots, with mail stacked within each square subsection.\\xa0 Mary joined me in rifling through the mail.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cHere,\\u201d Mary said, holding up an envelope.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Three envelopes addressed to one person, each sent from \\u2018Radham Academy\\u2019.\\xa0 I continued looking.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen looked through the packages under the desk.\\xa0 Her search was shorter than ours.\\xa0 Lillian was only just reaching the postman, checking he was only passed out and not actually dead.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We weren\\u2019t <em>complete</em> monsters.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo packages from Radham,\\u201d Helen said, standing straight.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnother two envelopes here,\\u201d I said, holding them up.\\xa0 Helen snatched them, freeing my hand for more looking.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cOne more,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I saw her move over to look at more slots.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cI already checked that column of slots,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThen I\\u2019m done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cAnd,\\u201d I checked the last two boxes, flipping through envelopes.\\xa0 \\u201cSo am I.\\xa0 That makes four people who are in Kensford, with ties to Radham.\\xa0 Anyone want to take bets on them having something?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t want to take that bet.\\xa0 But it\\u2019s a <em>chance</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie held out his hand as we rounded the corner.\\xa0 We handed over the envelopes.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gordon opened the door, and we let ourselves out.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Quick, careful.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I saw Jamie\\u2019s slight frown as he watched over the crowd.\\xa0 He hadn\\u2019t seen anything yet, or he would have spoken up.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Fray was watching.\\xa0 Now she knew we weren\\u2019t running.\\xa0 Not yet, anyway.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\\u2619</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cNo,\\u201d the man at the door said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cBecause we were told there was a brilliant researcher from Radham here,\\u201d Helen said, practically <em>effervescent</em> in attitude.\\xa0 \\u201cWe were <em>so</em> hoping to see his work.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat would not be me,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cWould you know who it was?\\xa0 We\\u2019re so short on time!\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cIt\\u2019s not me, I don\\u2019t know who it would be, and you\\u2019re <em>annoying,</em>\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The door slammed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Helen turned around very slowly, almost dazed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She <em>hissed.</em></p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I gave her a very careful pat on the shoulder, from maximum arm\\u2019s length.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re not annoying, Helen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">She made a small, noncommittal sound.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThat\\u2019s three down.\\xa0 One to go,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf this falls through, we need a new idea, or we need to plan to catch the next train out of here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Mary spat by the side of the road.\\xa0 I was pretty sure I saw a bystander further down the street look horrified at the action.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cJamie,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhich way to the next place?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Jamie had his back to us.\\xa0 His attention was to the far side of the street.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cJamie,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhich way?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShh,\\u201d I said, raising a hand.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">There was a long pause.\\xa0 Jamie didn\\u2019t move.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I felt a pang of worry.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cJamie,\\u201d I said, my voice soft.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat are you seeing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cShe\\u2019s changed clothes three times,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe hair changed once.\\xa0 The face stays the same.\\u201d</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cFray?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He shook his head.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\\u201cThe stitched,\\u201d I guessed.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">He nodded, pointing a finger.\\xa0 \\u201cShe disappeared a second ago, heading east.\\xa0 I was trying to see her through the crowd.\\xa0 Blue dress, black jacket and shaw-\\u201c</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">I was already moving.\\xa0 Mary was a step behind me, and Gordon a step behind her.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">We ran, and I didn\\u2019t slow a fraction as I hurled myself at the thicker part of the crowd.\\xa0 I turned my body sideways, I ducked low, I <em>pushed.</em></p>\\n<p>She had a headstart, but she was lame.</p>\\n<p>I was <em>spry, </em>and I was small.</p>\\n<p>The chaos of the crowd was my medium.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Mary were just behind me.\\xa0 Gordon was bigger but stronger.\\xa0 Mary was between us, but she had a natural grace.</p>\\n<p>I pulled ahead of the two, all the same.\\xa0 A part of me wondered if I wanted it more, and pushed myself harder because of it.</p>\\n<p>Considering how badly Mary wanted it, that said a lot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d Gordon called out.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t get too far ahead!\\xa0 We watch each other\\u2019s backs!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t have the breath to spare to respond.</p>\\n<p><em>This might be our one chance, ever.</em></p>\\n<p>I saw the crowd, I watched their movements, faced the choice of an alleyway or main street.</p>\\n<p>A curious, confused glance from a bystander suggested that something in the alleyway had caught his attention.</p>\\n<p>I took the cue.</p>\\n<p>I thought of the whelps and how they had died.</p>\\n<p>I <em>knew</em> I could be running headlong into a trap.</p>\\n<p>But I also knew, much in the same way I knew Jamie had been wrong about Fray\\u2019s motivations, that it wasn\\u2019t something Fray seemed inclined to do.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d challenged us, baited us.\\xa0 Simply ambushing me in an alley with the Headsman was\\u2026 it was too crude.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d Gordon called out.</p>\\n<p>He was just at the mouth of the alley.\\xa0 I faced a fork in the path.</p>\\n<p>I listened, and I heard only Gordon\\u2019s pounding footsteps on snow-slick cobblestone.</p>\\n<p>Snow.\\xa0 I looked at the ground.</p>\\n<p>There were a number of tracks in the snow, but one set was messier than others.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t <em>sure</em>, so I pointed, told Gordon to go right.\\xa0 I went down the left path.</p>\\n<p>Down the next branch of the alley, toward rushing water.</p>\\n<p>My footsteps slowed.\\xa0 I stopped, panting.</p>\\n<p>The area was the sort of place that would be a garden in the spring.\\xa0 There were stone boxes where plants would sprout, and a railing that looked down over a brook, bordered on both sides by stone walls.\\xa0 A small, quaint stone bridge was a short distance to our left.</p>\\n<p>The stitched was there.\\xa0 Steam rose off her, and she was huffing for breath too.\\xa0 Not that she would get tired in the same way.</p>\\n<p><em>Planned</em>.\\xa0 To get this far ahead, she would have had to run the second Jamie saw her.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d been told to show her face.</p>\\n<p>By Fray, who was leaning over the railing, arms folded.</p>\\n<p>She turned her head to look at me, then spoke to the stitched.\\xa0 \\u201cWendy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, ma\\u2019am?\\u201d Wendy replied.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGo meet Warren.\\xa0 Take the other path.\\xa0 Make noise, the others should hear you.\\xa0 Warren will protect you if they catch up to you two.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t expect a problem.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes ma\\u2019am,\\u201d Wendy said, nodding.\\xa0 She drew in a deep breath, then sprinted off.</p>\\n<p>No limp.</p>\\n<p>Ms. Fray looked at me, and it was a <em>calculating</em> look.\\xa0 She was analyzing me as I connected the dots.</p>\\n<p>She turned her back to me, and she beckoned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m glad it\\u2019s you,\\u201d she told me.\\xa0 \\u201cCome talk, Sylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/06/23/stitch-in-time-4-02/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The stitched servant helped lift our bags out from the side of the train.\\xa0 Mine had been the last one in, so it was the first one out.\\xa0 Once I had it, wheels digging tracks into the thin layer of snow, I turned to survey the area.</p>\\n<p>Storybook.\\xa0 Best label to apply to it all.\\xa0 Things were <em>quaint</em>, but in a very controlled, calculated way.\\xa0 The colors of the houses, the pleasant aesthetic, and the winding streets, many cobblestone with the beginnings of ruts carved into them, all planned and rigidly enforced.</p>\\n<p>It was <em>fascinating</em>.\\xa0 The houses were like cabins, but the exteriors were well looked after, white, gray, or blue in color, and almost every single one had smoke coming out of the chimney.\\xa0 The streets were gray cobblestone and lighter gray slabs of concrete, covered in white snow and the black grime the wagons and carriages had dredged up.\\xa0 For every man, there were five women, aged eighteen to thirty, and of those five women, four had monsters with them.\\xa0 Academy creations.</p>\\n<p>The subtle hideousness of Kensford was clearer as I looked at the trees and plants.\\xa0 In the early winter, there were trees and shrubs bristling with leaves, all a blood crimson in color, the leaves barely visible under the snow that had piled several feet high on each bough, or the ice that clung to branches.</p>\\n<p>There were also meat trees, in the natural-growing-meat sense and the \\u2018gibbets and meathook\\u2019 sense.\\xa0 Not too unusual, except they were <em>ubiquitous</em>.</p>\\n<p>The end result was, in the end, storybook.\\xa0 A town that embraced the old fashioned.\\xa0 But so many people romanticized history, and forgot how very bloody it was.\\xa0 The city smelled like smoke and crematoriums, and it made me feel like I was about to venture into a world where every house was a gingerbread house in disguise, and every pretty young woman was really a witch, ready to thrust unwitting children into ovens.</p>\\n<p>The other Lambs, now hauling their luggage, joined me, the six of us forming a loose line, looking at the town of Kensford.\\xa0 The only building that was taller than one story was the local Academy.\\xa0 Though all things in Kensford centered around Dame Cicely\\u2019s in a symbolic sense, it sat at the back, bordered on two sides by thick forest, a Victorian-style building grown like a tumor might be, asymmetrical, with the odd bit here and there.\\xa0 A tree had been literally grown from one side, closer to the forest, framing it all in a trimmed crescent of red leaves.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo pretty!\\u201d Helen exclaimed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid you ever want to come here?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 He was asking Lillian.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh\\u2026\\u201d Lillian said, sounding surprised at the question.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 You need to be at least eighteen, I think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut if you were?\\xa0 Or when you are?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Gosh</em>.\\xa0 I\\u2019d be terrified.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStrict?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes, but that\\u2019s not why,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She looked around, and stepped closer to Gordon as a pair of young women walked on, a stitched in fine clothes hauling their luggage.\\xa0 She lowered her voice and confided, \\u201cIt\\u2019s so <em>cutthroat</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA lot of Academies are,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t hear stories about other places like I hear stories about Dame Cicely\\u2019s Academy,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey intentionally fail out a certain percentage of each class, to cull and ensure they\\u2019re the <em>best</em>, or close to, because there\\u2019s Lady Eleanor\\u2019s-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She drew quiet as more young ladies walked by, departing from the train.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou scared of them?\\u201d I taunted her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to say something that would stir up any rivalries,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat was I saying?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t hear stories about other places like you hear stories about <em>here</em>,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThey intentionally fail a certain percentage of each class, to cull and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d Lillian said, a little flustered.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay.\\xa0 Yes.\\xa0 <em>Thank you,</em> Jamie.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I caught the twinkle in Jamie\\u2019s eye and elbowed him.\\xa0 He elbowed me back.</p>\\n<p>We continued back and forth like that as Lillian continued talking, \\u201cMost women who go to the Academies, they need permission and money from their parents, and from what I\\u2019ve seen and from what I\\u2019ve <em>heard</em>, most have to fight to hold on to their place.\\xa0 If they mess up once, one year of bad gradings or lack of advancement, it\\u2019s done, it\\u2019s over.\\xa0 Mom and dad cut off the funding and order you back home.\\xa0 Then they introduce you to a nice fellow to marry, and that\\u2019s your life.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA lot of people with guillotine blades hanging over their necks,\\u201d Gordon remarked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt gets worse,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cPut the two things together-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I finished the statement, \\u201c-And you have a lot of classmates who know their peers are dancing on a razor\\u2019s edge.\\xa0 Just a <em>tiny</em> bit of sabotage or cleverness, and there\\u2019s one less competitor for the remaining seats.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cExactly.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI never liked the idea of working in a stuffy lab all day,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI understand why people <em>would</em>, with it being the fastest path to greatness, but it didn\\u2019t feel like it was for me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou like the idea of <em>this</em>?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>She smiled, \\u201c<em>So much</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s nicer than the last few stops,\\u201d Gordon said, looking around.\\xa0 \\u201cI felt <em>itchy</em> after we slept at the last guest house.\\xa0 I\\u2019m still not convinced I don\\u2019t have something crawling on me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s not gripe,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Please.</em>\\xa0 New place, fresh start.\\xa0 It\\u2019s too easy to fall into old patterns.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were a few nods at that.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPost office, then we find out where we\\u2019re sleeping,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>That was our cue to advance.\\xa0 We carefully made our way through the crowd, weaving between the people who were walking and the clusters of people who had gathered in groups, talking.</p>\\n<p>None of the young ladies wore lab coats or uniforms.\\xa0 Rather, the monsters in their company were their emblems and badges, fashion accessories crafted of meat and grey matter.\\xa0 The better the work, the better the student.</p>\\n<p>Snow dusted us, drifting down in light amounts.\\xa0 There was no rain here.\\xa0 I was idly curious what the mechanism was for keeping the local experiments in line.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps the young ladies of Dame Cicely\\u2019s were managed carefully enough that there was no cause to worry about the experiments running off or causing trouble.</p>\\n<p>Jamie elbowed me for the hundredth time, but this one was to get my attention.\\xa0 He\\u2019d done the same to Helen, who\\u2019d gotten Gordon\\u2019s attention.</p>\\n<p>I followed Jamie\\u2019s line of sight.\\xa0 One of the houses had a set of stairs, and something dark moved in the space beneath the stairs.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhelps are here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, that\\u2019s fun,\\u201d I remarked.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s hope they leave her intact enough for us to ask questions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d rather hope we find her first,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>Ah, crap.\\xa0 For the second time in four minutes or so, we were stumbling on the same point.\\xa0 We weren\\u2019t finding many leads, and to date, we\\u2019d only been able to arrive on the days after our quarry had disappeared to places unknown.\\xa0 Half of the clues to her destination had been our finds, and the other half had been due to the work of others.\\xa0 Dog and Catcher, Hangman, or a tip from someone who\\u2019d seen one of the wanted posters and recognized her face.</p>\\n<p>It was wearing thin, and <em>some</em> of us were wrestling with frustration.\\xa0 There had been spats.</p>\\n<p>Rather than agree or disagree, I reached out and took Mary\\u2019s hand.</p>\\n<p>Then, in a majestically subtle manner, I declared, \\u201cThis has been <em>so</em> damn fun.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFun?\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re grumpy,\\u201d I noted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you <em>remember</em> how much the interviews in the Bowels sucked?\\xa0 This is the opposite of that, which means this is the furthest thing from suckage!\\xa0 It\\u2019s the best thing <em>ever</em> to get out and <em>away,\\u201d I said.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re chasing that bit of fluff that dances away from your hand as you reach for it,\\u201d she said, immune to my enthusiasm.\\xa0 \\u201cTell a dog to jump for the stick, and it will.\\xa0 The dog might really want that stick, but if you pull the stick away every time, the dog <em>learns.</em>\\xa0 I\\u2019d really like to think I\\u2019m better than a dog on that front.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHuh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFair, but didn\\u2019t expect to hear anything like that.\\xa0 Where did it come from?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPercy.\\xa0 He gave me lessons in training others.\\xa0 I thought he meant dogs at first.\\xa0 Then I thought he meant training my subordinates, when he\\u2019d created dozens upon dozens of clones.\\xa0 I only later realized it was how he trained me.\\xa0 He let me have my stick just often enough.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Not the first time Mary\\u2019s mentioned Percy in recent days and weeks</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t bring it to anyone\\u2019s attention.\\xa0 Instead, I commented, \\u201cSometimes, when you\\u2019re chasing that bit of fluff, you have to hold out your hand and be patient.\\xa0 Let it settle in on its own.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMm hmm,\\u201d Mary murmured.\\xa0 I suspected that she\\u2019d gotten the thrust of what I was trying to do, which was changing the course of the conversation.\\xa0 She played along, looking around, \\u201cThis place <em>is</em> neat.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>One and a half seconds after she said that, we passed a carriage, and Mary came face to face with a large, humanoid monster, built like an angel with wings of flesh, chest thrust out by a matter of design, chin high so that it looked down on everything around it.\\xa0 It was naked, and its limp member dangled right at Mary\\u2019s eye level, bigger around than my leg and as hairless as a baby\\u2019s.</p>\\n<p>I heard a slight \\u2018<em>eep</em>\\u2018 from Mary, which punched right past the latent tension and wonderings on my part and made me burst out into hysterical giggling.</p>\\n<p>The entire group soon followed, Mary included, tittering and laughing, the tension flowing away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think so, Mary?\\u201d Gordon asked, \\u201c<em>Neat</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were more giggles from the group.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor shame, all of you,\\u201d Helen said, putting her hands on her hips.\\xa0 \\u201cLaughing at that.\\xa0 Imagine the poor woman who made that thing.\\xa0 She must have been so <em>lonely</em>!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The giggles became outright laughter.</p>\\n<p>Perfect.\\xa0 <em>Good.</em></p>\\n<p>This was the sort of thing we needed.</p>\\n<p>Helen politely asked a passerby for the location of the nearest post office, and we went on our way.</p>\\n<p>The street might have been a fifty-fifty split of residences and small businesses, but as we reached the center of it all, we found that virtually every building touching on the main street served <em>some</em> purpose.\\xa0 including grocer\\u2019s stores that were no more than four paces by five paces across in size and a banking office just a little under twice that size.</p>\\n<p>Further down the way was the small post office.\\xa0 We filed in.</p>\\n<p>Helen approached the counter.\\xa0 \\u201cHello sir.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The polite young lady routine.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood morning, darling,\\u201d the man at the counter greeted her.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat can I do for you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe have a package?\\xa0 It\\u2019s addressed Lambsbridge, it should have arrived here a few days ahead of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man at the counter found it quickly enough.\\xa0 He placed the box on the counter.\\xa0 \\u201cStamp?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Without looking or saying a word, Helen put her hand back.\\xa0 Gordon passed her the stamp.\\xa0 She uncapped it and put the mark on the top of the box, inside the circle.</p>\\n<p>The man at the counter squinted, examining the mark Helen had just made with the one that the sender had put on it, then gave us a curt nod.\\xa0 \\u201cThere you go.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have a line, I was hoping we could ask some questions, please?\\u201d Helen asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou most certainly can.\\xa0 I\\u2019d be happy to answer them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich direction to the, um\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDormitories three hundred through three-fifty?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUp the main street, turn right at the stitchworks.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d she said, smiling.\\xa0 \\u201cAbout the package, you didn\\u2019t have anyone come in here and ask about it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, ma\\u2019am.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOr about children?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d the man said, a small crease appearing between his eyebrows.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou haven\\u2019t seen a woman, twenty or so, with black hair?\\xa0 She would have had a head with her, or a monster with a head that didn\\u2019t match the body?\\xa0 Also black-haired, with bright blue eyes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man puffed out his cheeks, letting out a breath.\\xa0 \\u201cI see someone like that every day.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Every single one of us was suddenly at attention.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve seen her?\\u201d Gordon jumped in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, no,\\u201d the man said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI mean, I see different young ladies who fit that general description on a regular basis,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cPretty young ladies, many with black hair, and many with experiments in their company.\\xa0 Those experiments range from big to small, fat to thin, and they have heads and eyes of all type.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cLillian, do you have it?\\xa0 The poster?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian fished inside her bag.\\xa0 She found a square of paper and unfolded it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe looks like this,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>The man slowly shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cAttractive young lady, but I couldn\\u2019t say.\\xa0 The customers become a blur, unless I get to know their names.\\xa0 This is the one you\\u2019re looking for?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cVery similar,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot the same person.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cI can\\u2019t say.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see,\\u201d Helen said, slumping a bit.\\xa0 She perked up all at once, \\u201cThank you, sir!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re welcome.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re looking for someone, I could keep an eye out, especially now that I\\u2019ve seen the picture.\\xa0 Does that help?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cActually\\u2026\\u201d I said, pausing strategically.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re concerned that someone is keeping a look out for <em>us</em>.\\xa0 We\\u2019re trying to surprise them, you see?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The furrow in between his eyebrows was now as deep as it could get.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSurprise party,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s rich as all-get-out, she\\u2019s from a powerful family, and it\\u2019s really hard to make a party something special for her.\\xa0 So if she asks if you\\u2019ve seen us, could you keep quiet on that?\\xa0 The surprise part is the only part that matters.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAhh.\\xa0 I think I understand,\\u201d the man said.\\xa0 \\u201cI can stay quiet, don\\u2019t you worry.\\xa0 Where are you all from?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That he asked was something of an irony.<em>\\xa0 </em>The less we told him, the better.\\xa0 The moment Ms. Fray realized we were on her trail \\u2013<em>if she was even here-, </em>she w<em>ould be in the wind.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cOutskirts of West York,\\u201d Gordon improvised, clearly thinking the same thing I was.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh?\\xa0 Ways away then.\\xa0 What brings you here?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The word escaped my mouth before I thought to say different.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFamily.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t miss the glances that were shot my way.\\xa0 Only Jamie didn\\u2019t.\\xa0 His focus was elsewhere.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm,\\u201d Jamie said, waiting until he had eye contact with the man before continuing, \\u201cIf it looks like the surprise party won\\u2019t happen, you can tell her whatever.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf it won\\u2019t happen?\\xa0 You mean, if she finds out some other way?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ll know what I mean if it comes down to it,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 I gave him a curious look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d the man said, dragging out the sound, slowly processing it.</p>\\n<p>Someone came into the post office behind us, and Helen took that as a cue.\\xa0 She waved, a little too dramatically, in a way that suited a smaller child.\\xa0 \\u201cGoodbye, sir.\\xa0 Thank you for everything!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was so good at becoming every adult\\u2019s favorite girl, so very quickly.\\xa0 The man gave a little wave back.</p>\\n<p>We stepped back out onto the street, and I fixed my cap and scarf, hunching against the cold.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe could be hiding in plain sight,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe man\\u2019s right.\\xa0 She\\u2019s a needle, and this is a haystack.\\xa0 It\\u2019s the perfect place for her to hide, maybe even lose our trail for good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo leads,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cJust like yesterday, and the day before.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I reached out and held her mittened hand with my gloved one, giving it a squeeze.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was that about, Jamie?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p><em>He cares too much</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat was what?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf the surprise party is spoiled?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt should make sense if Fray comes for him.\\xa0 She\\u2019s left a few bodies in her wake, and we\\u2019ve found reasons for most of them, but if she comes after him, looking for any details on us,\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want him upsetting her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d rather have her upset and ignorant than the other way around,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo would I,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut if it came down to him getting hurt for <em>nothing</em>, I\\u2019d rather he talk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon shook his head.</p>\\n<p>It was ironic.\\xa0 All Ms. Fray had to <em>really</em> do to maximize the damage she did to us was to keep doing what she was doing and play keep away.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d spent months in the Bowels, with only Sub Rosa to deal with at the tail end of it, and that had been less of a team effort than the vast majority of our jobs.\\xa0 Weeks on weeks of dreadfully dull interviews and interrogations, with little to show for it.</p>\\n<p>Now we were on the verge of another few months of something fruitless.\\xa0 Chasing a woman who forever remained at least one step ahead of us.</p>\\n<p>There were countless factors playing into it all, but at the very core of it, we were entering into the dangerous years.\\xa0 Important years for anyone, when boys became men and girls became women, but more important for <em>us</em>.</p>\\n<p>These were the years when we would be coming into our own.\\xa0 We\\u2019d be forging our identities and adapting our fit in the group.</p>\\n<p>We were losing our edge, without opposition to keep us sharp, and without a practical test of our abilities, we couldn\\u2019t find a new configuration that made up for all the little changes.\\xa0 It made for uncomfortable fits, little bits of bickering.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d <em>hated</em> the interviews in the Bowels, and as much as I was liked the chance to explore and stretch my legs, I didn\\u2019t think this was as constructive as what we collectively <em>needed</em>.</p>\\n<p>Mary was right.\\xa0 We needed to sink our teeth into the stick, not to chase it endlessly.</p>\\n<p>The thought crossed my mind:<em> If we don\\u2019t find an opportunity soon, I might well have to create a problem for the group to solve.\\xa0 Even if it gets me into untold trouble</em>.</p>\\n<p>At least this place seemed good for that.\\xa0 A pressure cooker of an Academy, stocked with cutthroat young ladies.</p>\\n<p>I heard rattling, and saw Helen working to open the box, cutting at tape with a fingernail.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re almost there,\\u201d Jamie remarked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe box feels light.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart sank at the same moment Mary breathed the words, \\u201cDon\\u2019t say that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen reached into the box and withdrew a small jar of pills.\\xa0 They were purple, and they numbered-</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFifteen, at a glance,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p><em>Three days</em>.</p>\\n<p>Gordon reached into the box, as Helen\\u2019s hands were full, and withdrew a folded letter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey want us back soon, so we can have our appointments,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to take us a day and a half to travel back to Radham.\\xa0 Three pills each\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary kicked a clump of ice that had fallen from a carriage, making it explode into icicles and shards.\\xa0 Heads turned.\\xa0 Mary crushed one of my hands in hers, her other hand clenched, a grim look on her face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTry to keep a low profile,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I put my hand out to stop him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey\\u2019re giving up on us,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey have enough faith in us to let us stay another day or two, follow up leads,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd they sent the Whelps, and Dog and Catcher, <em>and</em> the Hangman.\\xa0 And we <em>know</em> Catcher and the Hangman got closer to her than <em>we</em> did.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not a competition,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s important is stopping her from hurting people.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think Mary\\u2019s saying that isn\\u2019t important,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut it\\u2019s true,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re chasing a ghost.\\xa0 She\\u2019s <em>smart.\\xa0 </em>It <em>sucks</em>.\\xa0 We did so well on the last couple of jobs, proving the Lambs were worth something, now it feels like we\\u2019re backtracking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded.\\xa0 Jamie did too.</p>\\n<p>Rift mended, if just a little.</p>\\n<p>We turned onto a side street, at Jamie\\u2019s instruction.\\xa0 The buildings here were a little more uniform.\\xa0 It was possible that most of the quaint little cottage-houses were individual dormitory spaces, the rest occupied by people who supported the Academy town, like the postman, but these buildings lacked character.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLook at this like an opportunity,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is a <em>good</em> thing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>We quickly reached the dormitory where we were supposed to be staying, and we stopped as a group in front of the wrought-wood gate, taking shelter from the snowflakes under the canopy of a large evergreen with chains dangling from it.</p>\\n<p>In the summertime, the chains would have certain meats hung from them.\\xa0 Those treated meats would keep the pest and vermin populations down in a city where the gutters and sewers might literally run red with bodily fluids during exam time.</p>\\n<p>They did in <em>Radham</em>, it wasn\\u2019t unbelievable for it to happen here.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is good because it forces our hand.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think <em>any</em> of us are going to relax or take shortcuts in the next twenty-four hours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you think I\\u2019m taking shortcuts-\\u201d Mary started.\\xa0 I raised a hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know you don\\u2019t,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot <em>really</em>.\\xa0 None of us do, exactly, but yeah.\\xa0 Not what I meant.\\xa0 It\\u2019s less about shortcuts, and more that we all get <em>tired</em>.\\xa0 We get tired from different things and we get tired in different ways.\\xa0 In a crisis, I know we pull ourselves together and give our all\\u2026 but in a slog like this?\\xa0 Every day, at least one of us isn\\u2019t at our best.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were a few nods.\\xa0 Few would argue they were flawless.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is good <em>because</em> it\\u2019s a crisis,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can\\u2019t move on to another city, unless we have a <em>damn</em> good lead, so we focus our attention here.\\xa0 It makes sense that she\\u2019s enjoying being the needle in the haystack, which gives us every reason to think she\\u2019s left the city, but that I\\u2019m even thinking that means she\\u2019s probably second guessed it.\\xa0 I can usually play this game well, guess what people are doing when they aren\\u2019t even sure, but she plays it too.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s use this opportunity to catch her off guard, do something she wasn\\u2019t necessarily expecting.\\xa0 Change our approach.\\xa0 One and a half days of the absolute best work we can do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat sounds like a plan,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think we should split up.\\xa0 We operate in different ways, and we can cover more ground in different ways.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>No!</em></p>\\n<p><em>We need to bind the group together, find the right configuration!</em></p>\\n<p><em>And splitting up is always a bad idea!</em></p>\\n<p>Except I felt like saying that much aloud might ruin it.\\xa0 If people were self conscious, or the fractures in the group became conscious and significant rather than subconscious and minor\\u2026</p>\\n<p>Jamie glanced at me.\\xa0 The glance was an <em>ask</em>.\\xa0 He wanted to know what I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Then, as a subtle bit of manipulation, I added, \\u201cWe go out in pairs.\\xa0 We spend a duration doing our thing, then meet up, report in even if there\\u2019s nothing to report, touch base.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cSy, with me?\\xa0 Jamie and Mary together.\\xa0 Helen and Lillian.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause it makes sense,\\u201d he said, simply.</p>\\n<p>I frowned at him.\\xa0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s the worst answer you could\\u2019ve given.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf I give you more information, that\\u2019s slack you\\u2019ll use to hang me,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell <em>yeah</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCome on,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 He reached into Helen\\u2019s box and found a key, opened the door, and then dropped his luggage just inside.\\xa0 He reached out for Jamie\\u2019s.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you can\\u2019t stand my company, we can rearrange things after our first meeting.\\xa0 In one hour?\\xa0 Here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were nods.</p>\\n<p>I waited with him while he got everyone\\u2019s luggage organized inside and locked the door.\\xa0 The others were already fanning out, heading in different directions.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy, <em>really</em>?\\u201d I asked, now that everyone was gone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe group is splintering,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\xa0 Not a lot, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s splintering,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt can be fixed, but I think it\\u2019s best fixed at the ground level, the core.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRemember when it was just you, me, Jamie, and <em>sometimes</em> Helen?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Two years ago.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s get back to basics.\\xa0 You and I.\\xa0 Like in the old days.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I raised an eyebrow.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have something in mind?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s go recruiting,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/07/07/stitch-in-time-4-7/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>The train whistle howled, echoing across snowy Kensford, and with it went our escape.\\xa0 We\\u2019d made our call, and now we\\u2019d live with it.\\xa0 It bothered me, more than I cared to admit.\\xa0 If I was wrong, then we were going to get catastrophically ill, and we could very well die.</p>\\n<p>We were a squad, here.\\xa0 Each of us had a discrete role.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary were handling the front end of things, leading the group by a margin, scouting, peeking through windows of stores.\\xa0 My role was to watch Jamie.\\xa0 He had his book open in his arms, pen in hand, and was sketching.\\xa0 Every time a bystander, obstacle, or someone\\u2019s monstrous pet got in our way, I led him out of the way, while his eyes stayed on the page.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBy all accounts, the stitched girl was falling to pieces when Fray got her and left the jail.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t falling to pieces when she went to go distract you guys.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe fixed it, or improved it.\\xa0 How hard is that to do?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s easier to make one from scratched.\\xa0 In terms of cost, unless there\\u2019s a shortage of bodies, most people make a new stitched instead of fixing up an old one, I think.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I pulled Jamie out of the way of a gaunt stitched that looked like it incorporated some grafted features.\\xa0 Sections of its chest and arms had been stretched over containers of bile yellow liquid, with tubes running out of the containers and into flesh.\\xa0 Poison, probably.\\xa0 It hissed.</p>\\n<p>Jamie continued drawing, oblivious.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut how hard is it to do, Lil?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t call me Lil!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnswer the question, then, dummy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cButthead.\\xa0 It\\u2019s hard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, gee, thanks,\\u201d I told her.\\xa0 \\u201cThat clarifies things a bunch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what you want or why you\\u2019re asking!\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cMaking a stitched is easy, I\\u2019ve made a stitched, last year, for an exam.\\xa0 But if you want to repair it, you have to diagnose and fix whatever\\u2019s broken, probably have to replace or undo any damage to major chunks and pieces, rip out the wires and chemical tanks, put in new ones, um-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes that require tools?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cObviously.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cObviously,\\u201d I said, giving her an eye roll.\\xa0 \\u201cWould she need access to a lab to do it?\\xa0 Or could she do it using just the tools she\\u2019s packing in her bags?\\xa0 Keep in mind that she\\u2019s very good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019d need a lab,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe would.\\xa0 What about maintaining the thing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian gave me a so-so gesture.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t say?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked.\\xa0 I pulled Jamie out of the way of a lamp post.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou <em>can</em> cover your basic hygeine needs with a sponge and a sink, but it\\u2019s not fun, it gets old, and it takes time,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cDoing it on a bad week?\\xa0 You\\u2019d have to be pretty disciplined or have no other choice to take it in stride and not want to change it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI like that analogy,\\u201d Jamie said, eyes still on his sketch.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, Jamie,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPart two of that same question, then,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou saw her guy?\\xa0 The head?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 From a distance, and I was mostly running, but yes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow doable is <em>that</em> without a proper lab?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot at all,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d be surprised, impressed and scared if she was able to do that while running from us.\\xa0 She only ever stays in one place for a few days, if that long, and she\\u2019d need a lot of days to do that stuff.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cStolen work?\\u201d Jamie said, still sketching.\\xa0 I steered him with my hand on his left elbow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt would be reported stolen,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThat, or there\\u2019s a missing or dead scholar out there.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich we would have heard about,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI <em>hope.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAll signs point to the fact that she has a lab.\\xa0 Probably a nice one, with resources.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, goodie,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s see, there are twenty thousand people enrolled here, some are rooming at Dame Cicely\\u2019s itself, but most are in dormitory houses, one to four people to a house, and each house has a small, private lab.\\xa0 So\\u2026 oh, maybe five thousand places to check.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGold star for being on the ball,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cNice work, Lillian.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you, Jamie,\\u201d she said, looking as pleased as I\\u2019d seen her.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice of you to say so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I corrected his course when it looked like he might veer out into the street and the path of a horse or carriage.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re doing that on purpose,\\u201d I muttered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeing nice to Lillian?\\xa0 You should give it a try.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWalking into stuff,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The smile on his face suggested I was on target.</p>\\n<p>I let go of his elbow.\\xa0 He looked up for the first time, getting his bearings, then resumed sketching.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe has a lab, one she could pick up and leave from without a fuss,\\u201d I mused aloud.\\xa0 \\u201cHow many single-occupant dormitory houses?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAbout-\\u201d Lillian started.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne thousand,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat sounds right,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 A hundred and sixty-five for each of us, if we split it up.</p>\\n<p>Not doable, but it was something to think about, putting the puzzle together and figuring out how she operated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhich raises questions of how she got access.\\xa0 I doubt she enrolled.\\xa0 Smart as she is, she has to risk getting noticed and caught every time she goes to get materials or tools from Dame Cicely\\u2019s Academy.\\xa0 The work she\\u2019s doing is too good for a fugitive.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie looked up and over at me, paying attention now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>I\\u2019ve</em> been on the run, and the resource cost in terms of needing to find a place to sleep, watching your back, get food, acquire and spend money, it eats up whole chunks of your day.\\xa0 But here we have someone putting in <em>hours</em>, even <em>days</em> into high quality projects.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s been taking the Wyvern formula,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe has to take the time to make the Wyvern formula, and she needs to take the time to recuperate after taking it.\\xa0 That only furthers my point,\\u201d I said, getting more emphatic, more intense.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s your line of thought here?\\u201d Jamie asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnly that,\\u201d I said, deflating, all the emphasis and intensity flowing away.\\xa0 I was left with a feeling of frustration.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s all going a little too seamlessly for her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon and Mary had stopped and were waiting for us.\\xa0 Helen, trailing behind, watching our backs, caught up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCoat shop,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOoh, pretty coats,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne of the two I remembered,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd,\\u201d I said, pointing at the store across the street, \\u201cHat shop!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The rest of the group gave me funny looks.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWait one minute,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I checked for incoming horses and carts and then stopped, patting my pockets.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was extending the group\\u2019s wallet in my direction.\\xa0 I grabbed it, but he didn\\u2019t let go.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re spending the group\\u2019s money on a <em>hat</em>\\u2026\\u201d he warned me, leaving the threat implied.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I promised.</p>\\n<p>He let go of the wallet, and I ran across the street.</p>\\n<p>I stepped into the store.</p>\\n<p>The older woman at the counter took one look at me and said, \\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It was so much like what I\\u2019d come to expect from Hayle and the Lambs that it caught me off guard.\\xa0 \\u201cNo?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA little boy like you?\\xa0 You have no business here.\\xa0 You can\\u2019t buy what I\\u2019m selling, you\\u2019re grubby, and even if you have a slip, I\\u2019m not entrusting my product to you to take back to whoever sent you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Grubby</em>?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d like a hatbox, please,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI am not about to-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll pay,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I saw the hesitation.</p>\\n<p>Money made the world turn.\\xa0 Blood and sweat drove the world\\u2019s engines, but money bought blood and sweat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSix dollars,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cFor an empty hatbox.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019re up to any mischief with this, hurting my reputation-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNot at all, ma\\u2019am.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She made a face, like conceding and doing anything more than sending me out the door was horribly unpleasant and vaguely offensive.</p>\\n<p>I returned to the others, a nice little hatbox with a ribbon in my hands.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m guessing that only a few of us can come and see what you\\u2019re actually trying to pull?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>I thought of the sour woman in the hat shop, then shook my head.\\xa0 We couldn\\u2019t waste time.\\xa0 Better to use force of numbers.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFollow my lead,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe use the herd.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We moved into the coat store as a mob.\\xa0 The people at the counter were two men, possibly related, but not too closely, one with a thick mustache and a vest over his button-up shirt, the other clean-shaven, wearing a suit jacket that was closed up to the collarbone.</p>\\n<p>The store had a hardwood floor, one that had been grown, from the odd way it interconnected and flowed, with coats and suits on racks and dummies.\\xa0 There were umbrellas and parasols mounted on one wall, and shoes on another.\\xa0 A stitched stood by the dressing room, a coat draped over one arm.\\xa0 A shop for top quality goods.</p>\\n<p>I approached the counter, hugging the box.\\xa0 The others followed, close behind.\\xa0 I liked that they read my body language, sensing the best way to follow suit, without my having to tell them.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d been missing that, lately.\\xa0 Each of us had been a touch preoccupied with ourselves.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI caught this box as it fell off a carriage,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think the driver forgot to put it inside before leaving.\\xa0 We wanted to give it back to the woman.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUhh,\\u201d Mr. Mustache said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know that we could help you with that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe box is from the shop across the street, and the woman there said the woman who bought it <em>definitely</em> came from your shop, and they had a new coat, but she hadn\\u2019t worn one coming in.\\xa0 I think the one she bought was a long one?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMost of my coats are long,\\u201d Mr. Mustache said, sounding vaguely offended.</p>\\n<p>I nodded, vigorous, agreeing.\\xa0 <em>And she would change things up.\\xa0 After having a short coat, she\\u2019d make a subtle change.</em>\\xa0 \\u201cShe had a stitched with her, and there was a big fellow, but he might have stayed outside?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe ask all of the experiments to stay outside.\\xa0 As for your young lady, I\\u2026 no, I\\u2019m afraid that doesn\\u2019t ring any bells.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHigh quality work,\\u201d Lillian piped up.\\xa0 \\u201cThe stitched.\\xa0 She\\u2019s very thin, very pretty, you wouldn\\u2019t even know she was one if you weren\\u2019t careful, but you\\u2019d know if she talked, probably.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>Jamie held up his book.\\xa0 The sketches were strange, very scratchy, somehow not good art, but still a scarily accurate representation of the stitched girl and, I presumed, an accurate representation of the Headsman.</p>\\n<p>I saw no recognition on either of the men\\u2019s faces.</p>\\n<p><em>We\\u2019re looking for needles in a goddamn haystack</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe other woman had a bandaged hand?\\u201d I tried.</p>\\n<p>Nothing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy does it matter that much?\\u201d Mr. Mustache asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were\\u2026\\u201d I tried to look a little ashamed.</p>\\n<p>Gordon reached over and took the hatbox.\\xa0 \\u201cHe wanted reward money.\\xa0 I convinced him it was the right thing to do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReward money would be nice,\\u201d I said, quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a nice looking hat.\\xa0 It probably cost a lot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I felt like we\\u2019d struck the right chord.\\xa0 The men at the counter had been boys once.\\xa0 Between Gordon and I, we\\u2019d struck the right balance, between my innocent greed and Gordon\\u2019s genuine desire to do the right thing.</p>\\n<p>Now, if I was gauging them right, we had them actually <em>wanting</em> us to succeed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cToday?\\u201d Mustacheless asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes sir.\\xa0 Within the last hour.\\xa0 Probably the last half-hour, I\\u2019d bet,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>That got a shake of the head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re sure?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve been at the counter for this entire afternoon.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sure,\\u201d Mustacheless said.\\xa0 Mr. Mustache nodded.</p>\\n<p>I saw the other Lambs react, shoulders dropping, disappointment clear in their body language.\\xa0 We\\u2019d try the other shop, and then we\\u2019d be limited in where we could go next, if that didn\\u2019t work out.</p>\\n<p>My instincts, however, told me that the other shop would be a dead end.\\xa0 It was too close to where the others had encountered the Headsman.\\xa0 She would have had to double back, and she would have had to do it while avoiding the others.</p>\\n<p>It didn\\u2019t fit.\\xa0 So many things here didn\\u2019t damn well fit.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d I asked, abrupt.\\xa0 No \\u2018sir\\u2019 or anything of the sort.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy?\\u201d the man asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy are you sure?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t remember seeing that girl, or anyone resembling her,\\u201d Mr. Mustache said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut we didn\\u2019t describe the girl we\\u2019re looking for, with the injured hand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe young women don\\u2019t shop alone,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe ones who do stand out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat if someone came in, and looked like they were part of another group?\\u201d Helen asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIsn\\u2019t that possible?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf that\\u2019s the case, I don\\u2019t know what I could tell you,\\u201d Mustacheless said.</p>\\n<p>Frustrated at every turn.</p>\\n<p>Except\\u2026</p>\\n<p>Change one paradigm, and all the little details that hadn\\u2019t added up started to make sense.\\xa0 How did she get the dormitory?\\xa0 How did she acquire the resources to do her work without getting caught?\\xa0 How did she blend so effortlessly into the surroundings?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s new in town,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He frowned.\\xa0 \\u201cYou know this how?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s new in town,\\u201d I said, more excited, ignoring him, \\u201cDid you see anyone, a new face, dark hair, spending time with someone that you\\u2019ve seen around?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see a lot of young ladies, day to day,\\u201d he told me.\\xa0 I got the impression that the line of questions was starting to test his patience.\\xa0 This was dissonance at work.\\xa0 He knew that things didn\\u2019t add up, and if I only stopped to give him a chance, he could start asking questions I couldn\\u2019t answer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m sure,\\u201d I said, not giving him that chance.\\xa0 \\u201cBut your clientele is exclusive.\\xa0 People who can <em>pay</em>.\\xa0 The stranger showed up, maybe with a borrowed coat, maybe without a coat at all, and the familiar face footed the bill.\\xa0 There might have been an age difference, but they probably looked <em>close.\\xa0 </em>You noticed, because it was different and it was new.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The look in his eyes wasn\\u2019t <em>nothing</em>.\\xa0 In fact, both men seemed to register something.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2026 you were doing something else, but you came to talk,\\u201d I said, to Mr. Mustache.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause you knew her, and she introduced you to her new friend.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTutor,\\u201d Mr. Mustache said, absently.\\xa0 His expression clarified into a curious stare.\\xa0 \\u201cYou sound like you know an awful lot more than someone who caught a box off the top of a carriage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cTell us, what\\u2019s her name, and where can we find her?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to find and stop a very bad person,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe young lady you know, she could be in grave danger.\\xa0 A hostage, to an enemy of the Crown.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2026\\u201d Mustacheless said, and it was like his brain had momentarily broken, caught in a loop that left the sound drawling out of his mouth.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPerhaps,\\u201d Mr. Mustache said, in what approximated a diplomatic tone, \\u201cI should contact the authorities?\\xa0 It seems like the safest way forward.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo time,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019d rather be sure,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo time,\\u201d I said, again, feeling frustrated.\\xa0 A step closer, and now we were hitting a wall?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBennoit, perhaps you could run next door to use their phone?\\xa0 We-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Exaperated, I gave the signal, the \\u2018go ahead\\u2019 to the others.</p>\\n<p>Let them have at it.</p>\\n<p>Helen and Mary were quickest, and best situated to get closer.</p>\\n<p>As the two girls rounded the corner, Mr. Mustache reached under the desk, and produced a short blade.</p>\\n<p>Mary slapped it aside with her hand, but rather than shred her flesh, produced a metal-on-metal sound.\\xa0 The blade moved over the counter, she slapped it down, hard, so it struck the wooden countertop, and sent it flying to the ground.\\xa0 She touched a blade to Mr. Mustache\\u2019s stomach.</p>\\n<p>The man\\u2019s partner, Benoit, froze, as he saw the blade draw close to Mr. Mustache.\\xa0 Helen drew close, ordered, \\u201cKneel,\\u201d and he did, with only a moment\\u2019s pause.\\xa0 She stepped behind him and wrapped her fingers around his neck.</p>\\n<p>Gordon rounded the counter as well, to draw closer to them.\\xa0 I checked on Lillian, and found that she was at the door, locking it.\\xa0 Jamie watched the window, hugging his book.</p>\\n<p>I dug in my pockets and found the badge that Briggs had given me.\\xa0 I slapped it down on the counter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe act in service to the Crown.\\xa0 You haven\\u2019t heard of us, but-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Radham children.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I blinked a few times.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are stories,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cOnes that made the rounds anew when the post office was attacked.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Our reputation is preceding us.\\xa0 Not a great thing for a secret project.</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen you have some idea of how we operate?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome idea.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not supposed to be public knowledge.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 You can give us what we want, stay quiet about everything that happened here, and the Crown may choose to reward you.\\xa0 Or you can stay silent, and face the repercussions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf we could contact the authorities-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shook his head.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you\\u2019re dangerous enough to threaten us, I couldn\\u2019t send you after a proper young lady, knowing you might do the same to her.\\xa0 A gentleman-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA gentleman without the \\u2018man\\u2019 part,\\u201d Mary murmured, moving the knife to lower regions, \\u201cIs only gentle.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen giggled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>This</em> young lady would go right for the most sensitive part of you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is where she and I differ.\\xa0 She\\u2019s merciless.\\xa0 She goes right for the jugular.\\xa0 She\\u2019s a killer.\\xa0 Me?\\xa0 I\\u2019m very good when it comes to breaking people.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve learned from some of the worst of Radham.\\xa0 People who learned to fight the way people who have nothing to lose fight.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve learned from people who live every day knowing that Dog and Catcher or another monster could come after them because they do shady things, things that involve hurting other people, sometimes for hours out of every day.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He picked up the little blade.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI won\\u2019t mince words.\\xa0 That\\u2019s <em>his</em> style, not mine,\\u201d he said, indicating me, twirling the blade in his hands.\\xa0 \\u201cI know how to torture people.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want to, none of us do, but if you\\u2019re going to be so stupid as to get in our way when we\\u2019re trying to save a young woman\\u2019s life, well, the pieces will fall where they may.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReassess those priorities,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMy friends there, they might seem a little scary.\\xa0 But this is a scary meant for someone who threatens a well-to-do citizen of the Crown, and very possibly threatens Kensford as a whole.\\xa0 The whole reason we\\u2019re doing this, right now, is because you\\u2019re twisting everything out of shape, taking the path of most resistance.\\xa0 The moment you give way, relax, tell us what you\\u2019re supposed to tell us, then everything goes back to the way it\\u2019s supposed to be.\\xa0 We work against enemies of the Crown, you go back to doing business, the young lady ends up safe, and you can feel like you did something right.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>No answer was immediately forthcoming.</p>\\n<p><em>A gentleman</em>, I thought.</p>\\n<p><em>This</em> was the obstacle that was in our way?</p>\\n<p>Gordon started toward Mr. Mustache.\\xa0 Mustacheless opened his mouth, \\u201cLady Claire.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon turned around.\\xa0 He put the weapon on the counter.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLady Claire.\\xa0 She stays at the Academy.\\xa0 She has special accommodations, her family is related to the headmaster.\\xa0 Her father and uncles are military, working heavily alongside the Academies.\\xa0 She\\u2026 she was so despondent, she was going to fail out, she couldn\\u2019t meet the requirements to keep her seat.\\xa0 When the tutor appeared just yesterday, a pretty young someone from the country, Lady Claire looked so relieved.\\xa0 She couldn\\u2019t stop babbling.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe lives at Dame Cicely\\u2019s Academy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man nodded, looking fairly well crushed.\\xa0 \\u201cThe tutor, she\\u2019s really a threat to the girl?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said, suspecting I was lying.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s killed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked at Jamie, who was making notes, all the information that the two men from the coat store had shared.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you talk, telling more tales about the Radham Children, you can expect another visit from us,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>The man paused, the nodded.</p>\\n<p>Mary backed away, knife held up.\\xa0 She collected the blade from the counter, then tossed it into the corner by the door, still backing up as she joined us.\\xa0 Helen was far more casual, letting go and practically skipping to us.</p>\\n<p>We left, moving unanimously toward the Academy.\\xa0 We put a fair bit of distance between ourselves and the store, disappearing amid the crowd, before we broke the silence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou weren\\u2019t really going to torture them, were you?\\u201d Lillian asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure if he was lying.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause that\\u2019s not right,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut the stakes are high, and time might be short.\\xa0 If we can\\u2019t get her before we\\u2019re forced to go back to Radham, or if she slips away, then we might not get another chance to stop whatever it is she has planned.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I spoke up, \\u201cShe made a point of telling me about weapons buried beneath the small towns.\\xa0 She\\u2019s been visiting small towns.\\xa0 She might have collected something,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOr she\\u2019s set things to go off, experiments get loose\\u2026 turns the academy\\u2019s weapons against itself.\\xa0 It would fit her style.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPut a drop of alcohol on a scorpion\\u2019s back, and it stings itself to death,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>I raised an eyebrow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen your enemy is so geared toward violence, it doesn\\u2019t take much to make them destroy themselves,\\u201d she explained.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGiven how you all are acting,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cYou\\u2019re hungry for this catch, and it scares me a little.\\xa0 That line about the scorpion could apply to you all too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Us</em> all,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot <em>you</em> all.\\xa0 You\\u2019re one of us.\\xa0 If something happens to the Lambs, you\\u2019re included in it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Radham Children,\\u201d Jamie mused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a problem too,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cDidn\\u2019t expect that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe scene with Mauer, the scholars who saw us dealing with Sub Rosa, someone talked.\\xa0 Rumors got out,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cHayle talked to me about this, before.\\xa0 He and Briggs have a plan.\\xa0 In case we stop being so secret.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cReally?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIs it a good plan?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s a Briggs plan,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s focus on the here and now.\\xa0 Genevieve Fray has a <em>patron.\\xa0 </em>She\\u2019s lied or conned her way to getting pay, lab space, resources, protection and company, and the patron might not know.\\xa0 She\\u2019s keeping the company of someone she can use as a hostage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was a good catch, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 I just wished I\\u2019d connected to it earlier.</p>\\n<p>Dame Cicely\\u2019s was a nice building, pale, and the branches that grew out of it were more discrete.\\xa0 The windows were ornate, not made of branches but thick wrought iron molded to look like wood, glass stretched between. \\xa0 A sprawling\\xa0 garden near the front had young women walking through it, talking in groups, with their monsters in their company, walking a few paces behind.\\xa0 I was a little surprised that the gardens were so popular, when they were covered in snow, but I supposed it spoke to the need to get away.\\xa0 Much like the delinquents with their campfire off to the side of the woods.</p>\\n<p>Jamie put out a hand, stopping Gordon.\\xa0 With Gordon, the rest of us stopped in our tracks.</p>\\n<p>He pointed.</p>\\n<p>Three female figures,

forward, hood pulled down low.\\xa0 \\u201cKind of hard to disappear in the crowd when there\\u2019s like, fifty kids in a town of fifteen thousand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYup,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 He was perched on the window ledge, taking his tools out, two small, thin rods.\\xa0 He put the two of them together into the lock at the outside of the window.\\xa0 Wrought iron branches and glass.\\xa0 A quick check on Gordon\\u2019s part had verified that the room was empty.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve counted at least sixty,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cSixty kids.\\xa0 Your count is way off.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh lords, shut up, Jamie,\\u201d I said, groaning.</p>\\n<p>Jamie stuck out his tongue at me.\\xa0 I reached out to grab it, only for it to disappear back into his mouth.\\xa0 I settled for lightly swatting at his cheek instead.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhere did you learn to do that?\\u201d Mary asked Gordon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSome rough types in Radham, professional thieves.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow hard is it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI dunno,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI have a good sense of touch and fine dexterity, so I found it pretty easy.\\xa0 Sy tried his hand at it too, but he doesn\\u2019t keep up the practice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary looked at me, looking vaguely offended at the idea.\\xa0 I shrugged.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow come?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI forget it.\\xa0 I learn it, and it\\u2019s fast to pick up.\\xa0 Then I don\\u2019t have an excuse to do it for a while, or something comes up, like an appointment, and I feel like I\\u2019m starting from scratch.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy can forget how to ride a bike,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>With that, I saw a bit of sympathy from Mary, rather than that vague accusation of before.</p>\\n<p>I shrugged, hands back in my pockets.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd we\\u2019re in,\\u201d Gordon said, taking the attention off me.\\xa0 He hopped down, and collected his stuff, before sliding the lockpicking kit between his pants and his underwear, hiding the clip behind his belt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI still have a few practice locks and some picks in my room back at Lambsbridge,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cRemind me, I\\u2019ll lend them to you,\\u201d I told Mary.</p>\\n<p>She gave me a winning smile at that.</p>\\n<p>Gordon finished setting up, looking up at the window, the windowsill a few feet up off the ground.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wish we were <em>taller</em>, now that I\\u2019m thinking about it,\\u201d I commented.\\xa0 \\u201cBe nice to-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon then lunged up to the window ledge with no effort at all.\\xa0 He caught it, then swung himself over in the next second.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-Be able to get up there without a boost,\\u201d I finished.\\xa0 He had needed help before, but I supposed one of his hands had been full with the lockpicks.</p>\\n<p>I moved beneath the window, knitting my fingers together to provide a step for the others.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019ve gone over this.\\xa0 If you\\u2019re down here while we go up, you\\u2019re going to look up our skirts.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPshh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll go up first, then.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd then you look down the front of my blouse when I\\u2019m climbing over,\\u201d Lillian said, accusatory.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Your</em> blouse?\\xa0 Nah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ah, the look on her face told me I\\u2019d struck home.\\xa0 <em>Indignation, the opiate of bastardly sorts the world over.\\xa0 </em>That was what she got for being annoying.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBesides, it\\u2019s winter, there aren\\u2019t any necklines,\\u201d I said, changing the topic before she found the words to yell at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Interesting</em> that you\\u2019d take note of that so readily,\\u201d Jamie said, dry.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s obvi-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGuys,\\u201d Gordon said, cutting me off.\\xa0 He was looking down on us from up above, chest resting on the windowsill.\\xa0 \\u201cPay attention?\\xa0 And maybe be a little quieter?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBoost?\\u201d I asked Jamie.</p>\\n<p>He gave me a hand.\\xa0 I kipped up high enough that I could grab Gordon\\u2019s arm, and he hauled me up the rest of the way.</p>\\n<p>It made me think.\\xa0 The difference in our sizes, the difference in our strength.\\xa0 He was capable of hauling me up off the ground and leaving me dangling.\\xa0 At thirteen, he looked closer to fifteen or sixteen.\\xa0 He had a <em>physique</em>, rather than a child\\u2019s body that just happened to have fat on it, or minimal fat, as mine did.</p>\\n<p>While he caught Lillian\\u2019s bag and deposited it on the floor, I found myself measuring the difference in our heights.\\xa0 He was almost ten inches taller than me, if I had to guess.\\xa0 In the spring, it had been closer to three or four.</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t that he was growing <em>that</em> fast.\\xa0 Well, he was growing with a surprising speed, but that wasn\\u2019t the whole of it.</p>\\n<p>My height hadn\\u2019t really changed, nor had my build.</p>\\n<p>I offered a hand in helping Lillian up, realized I was getting in the way more than I was helping, and backed off a little.</p>\\n<p>Together with her, I surveyed the surroundings.\\xa0 We were in a dormitory bedroom, but it was <em>nice</em>.\\xa0 The furniture looked like antiques, or something expensive that would be antique someday.\\xa0 Four poster bed, a writing desk with leather-backed books on a shelf above it, a bookcase with more texts on it, and a wall-mounted blackboard with notations and formulas on one half, and a to-do list on the other.</p>\\n<p>Gordon helped Helen up.\\xa0 She was more graceful than Lillian had been, planting a foot on the windowsill, holding onto Gordon\\u2019s hand, then stepping down and dropping to a crouch-come-curtsy on landing.\\xa0 She gave me a winning smile as she straightened up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re ridiculous,\\u201d I said, my voice low.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m in a good mood,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cBecause we\\u2019re on the prowl.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have moods,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have biological imperatives, thank you very much,\\u201d she said, prim, hands clasped behind her back, \\u201cAnd one of those imperatives is to stalk and kill.\\xa0 We\\u2019re stalking.\\xa0 It\\u2019s <em>nice</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m more inclined to blame the chocolate cake from earlier,\\u201d I told her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHmph.\\xa0 That\\u2019s one of my other biological imperatives.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian nodded as if this was the most sensible thing in the world.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you <em>actually</em> developing a sense of humor?\\u201d I asked, a little stunned.</p>\\n<p>She winked at me, then spun around.\\xa0 \\u201cGordon, do you think we\\u2019ll be exiting this way?\\xa0 Can I hide my coat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBetter to keep it,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ll look more like we belong if we don\\u2019t have outdoor stuff on,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon made a noncommittal grumbling noise.\\xa0 He helped Jamie up, plucking the book from Jamie\\u2019s hands, handing it to me, then helping Jamie through.\\xa0 I provided the book once Jamie\\u2019s boots were firmly on the hardwood floor.</p>\\n<p>Mary came up next.\\xa0 No boost.\\xa0 A short running start, from the sounds of it, stepping onto the wall, and grabbing Gordon\\u2019s hand.</p>\\n<p>As she hopped down, I found myself comparing our heights.</p>\\n<p>She was a few inches taller than me, but unlike Gordon, she hadn\\u2019t quite shaken off the gawkishness of being young.\\xa0 She had little traces of femininity here and there, promises of what was to come, but she also had natural flourish and style, instilled in her by Mothmont and Percy both.\\xa0 She was a <em>lady</em>, when she was of a mind to be.</p>\\n<p>Helen was the inverse, in some ways, a little shorter than Mary, but already taking shape as a young woman.\\xa0 It was little surprise, but she was the fastest of the girls to develop hips and chest, and she was gradually altering her blonde ringlets to match, inching ever closer to a woman\\u2019s hairstyle over a young girl\\u2019s, a journey that would take just the right amount of time to complete.\\xa0 Helen could be a lady, she could be a precocious child, and switched between the two at a whim.\\xa0 As I knew her, though, there was a wildness to her, as if a genie had bottled up a predator in the guise of a child, and all of the growls and restless pacing was translated into sweet smiles and flourishes, and in stillness, waiting like the spider or the praying mantis, she conveyed nothing more or less than the young woman at ease.</p>\\n<p>Jamie, like me, still embraced the awkwardness of youth, in frame and face, but he had height.\\xa0 He\\u2019d quietly embraced his own style, with the long blond hair and the glasses, the book forever in his arms, drawing up subtle walls between him and the world, while his eyes peered past, taking everything in.</p>\\n<p>And then Lillian.\\xa0 Still young, shortest of the girls now, still awkward in youth and figure.\\xa0 A step behind, in so many ways, but I respected how she\\u2019d come to find and earn her place among us.\\xa0 She chose clothes carefully, and remained conscious and defensive of her girlishness in a way that Helen and Mary would never have to.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t sure what I was doing, studying them, but it was some hybrid approach to measuring myself against them and defining the tools we had available to use against Fray.</p>\\n<p>This was dangerous territory.\\xa0 All it took was one person to raise an alarm of sorts, asking questions about why such young children were in a school for young ladies already exiting or out of their adolescent years, and Fray might be able to react against us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAny thoughts on the coats?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeen thinking about it,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI say coats off.\\xa0 If we\\u2019re traipsing around with this stuff on, they might be more likely to ask questions.\\xa0 We need to look like we belong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven if we stick out like sore thumbs,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEven if,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>Mary nodded in agreement.\\xa0 She was already removing her coat.\\xa0 Lillian, Gordon, Helen and I were a step behind.</p>\\n<p>Halfway through pulling my stuff off, tightly folding the forest green scarf into a bundle I could put in a pocket, I saw that Jamie was standing by the bookcase, a book open in front of him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne second.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I finished pulling all my stuff off, and handed it over to Gordon, who stuffed it under the bed.\\xa0 I walked over to Jamie, and glanced over his elbow to see the book he was looking over.</p>\\n<p>Rows on rows of portraits, with names beneath.\\xa0 He gave each page only a moment\\u2019s glance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLeft arm,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>Without taking his eyes off the book, he held out his left arm.\\xa0 I pulled his jacket free of the arm.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRight arm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I pulled the coat free, then handed it to Gordon.\\xa0 Like the rest, the coat disappeared beneath the bed.\\xa0 Mary had already closed the window, and was busy with her sweater up around her ribs, tucking her shirt into her skirt in such a way that it wouldn\\u2019t hamper her access to the knife handles that only slightly stuck up from her beltline.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cKey things,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cCover?\\xa0 Anyone asks, we\\u2019re prospective students.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGirl\\u2019s only school,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJamie, Gordon and I will cross-dress,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I saw the annoyed looks, and I cracked a grin, \\u201cThe school is going co-ed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNobody\\u2019s going to believe that,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe woman-only nature of the school is important.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBlame it on money and nobility,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cSome prat lord decided he wanted to go to the school with all the girls, set the wheels in motion.\\xa0 Only the higher-ups and some important people know.\\xa0 Anyone asks, we don\\u2019t <em>say</em>, but we imply we\\u2019re important enough to know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were a few nods.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBest to avoid being in a position where we have to justify anything,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell <em>yeah</em>, obviously,\\u201d I agreed.</p>\\n<p>Gordon nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cOkay.\\xa0 That\\u2019s the story.\\xa0 When you\\u2019re inventing yourselves, stick to points and names established during previous infiltration jobs.\\xa0 If possible, let Jamie come up with the details.\\xa0 He\\u2019s best at that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan do,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I raised a finger,\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to find out what Fray is doing, disarm and disrupt her.\\xa0 That means finding the lab, the room where she\\u2019s staying, or <em>something</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were a few nods.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFinally, Lady Claire.\\xa0 We need to find her.\\xa0 Through her, we have access to Fray, information, whatever else.\\xa0 Depending on what\\u2019s going on, we might be able to get clues, or figure out a path of attack.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSchool hours are over,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s late afternoon, and if Dame Cicely\\u2019s is anything like Radham Academy, the girls are going to return to their rooms to change clothes for dinner sometime soon, if they aren\\u2019t already.\\xa0 They\\u2019ll go to the dining hall to eat, if they don\\u2019t go into town, and then there\\u2019ll be a few hours of social activity and studying before people start settling in for the night.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 Lillian smiled at the praise.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFray is Lady Claire\\u2019s tutor,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cClaire is a poor student, and Fray is her savior.\\xa0 That means Claire is devoted, indebted, probably disconnected from her peers.\\xa0 I\\u2019m thinking they\\u2019re going to eat out, or eat in their rooms.\\xa0 We find out where they\\u2019re working, try to mark her location, divide our attention between investigating whatever it is she\\u2019s doing and keeping track of her.\\xa0 See if we can\\u2019t-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The doorknob rattled, and I was immediately silent.\\xa0 All six sets of eyes were now on the door.</p>\\n<p>A key scratched at the lock, then raked its way into the keyhole.</p>\\n<p>Just like that, Jamie, Helen, Lillian and I stepped back to the side of the bed, using it to conceal ourselves.\\xa0 Gordon and Mary advanced, exchanging a brief set of hand signals.</p>\\n<p>Gordon pointed, formed a fist, jerking it toward his shoulder.\\xa0 You.\\xa0 Pull.\\xa0 That second sign worked as \\u2018get\\u2019, \\u2018take\\u2019, or \\u2018hold\\u2019, depending.</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s response was a \\u2018yes\\u2019.\\xa0 Fist formed, pumped slightly in the air.</p>\\n<p>Gordon twisted, looking at Lillian.\\xa0 A point, then another gesture, a hand waved over his face.</p>\\n<p>You.\\xa0 Sleep.\\xa0 The second sign could mean tired, drunk, it didn\\u2019t really matter.\\xa0 Lillian made an alarmed sound, reaching for her bag, pulling it around in front of her so she could rummage within.\\xa0 I had a glimpse of the contents, metal plates keeping things rigid and protecting bottles and syringes.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was already turning and grabbing the chair from beside the desk, approaching as the door swung open.</p>\\n<p>A young woman, eighteen or so, stepped into the room.\\xa0 A little heavy, with a hairstyle that didn\\u2019t suit her round face, but not without her appeal.\\xa0 A definite cute \\u2018girl next door\\u2019 type.</p>\\n<p>She looked at Gordon with shock, as Mary stepped in from the corner behind the door and gave her a hard shove.</p>\\n<p>The girl stumbled forward, and Gordon swung the top of the chair into her solar plexus.</p>\\n<p><em>Have they been practicing, or is this their natural dynamic? </em> I wondered.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was still searching her bag as the woman crumpled to all fours on the floor, trying and failing to breathe.</p>\\n<p>Things weren\\u2019t so simple as all that.\\xa0 The girls of Dame Cicely\\u2019s were never alone.\\xa0 Each and every one had a pet, their status symbol, suggesting the kind of work they focused on, and the skills they were able to bring to bear.\\xa0 The room\\u2019s occupant was no different.\\xa0 It shouldered its way past the door that Mary had tried to close between it and its master.</p>\\n<p>It looked like a human with all the skin pulled off in a singular piece, bug-eyed without its eyelids, teeth too white against a backdrop of crimson.\\xa0 The torso had been stretched, making it tall enough its head almost scraped the doorframe.\\xa0 The arms had been removed and replaced with a row of insect limbs that extended from hip to shoulders, each of the limbs tipped with a wicked looking claw, thorn-like growths running down the length of each.</p>\\n<p>It noted its fallen mistress and made an alarmed noise.\\xa0 The sound didn\\u2019t resemble anything human or insectile, guttural and wet, like someone in the end stages of pneumonia might make if they had to scream <em>something</em> to save their loved ones from an approaching killer.</p>\\n<p>It staggered forward, the slow, awkward gait of the body not matching the fluid, precise movement of the clawed arms, each arm drawing back, then stabbing.\\xa0 Mary dropped low to the ground, started to retreat toward Gordon, but proved it to be a feint, dodging back behind the thing, shutting the door, sealing us in with it.</p>\\n<p>Gordon shoved the four legs of the chair at it, and two of the claws punched through the seat, no doubt at least an inch and a half of solid wood.\\xa0 He wrenched his body, moving the chair to one side, and managed to block one more claw that had been trying to reach past the chair to stab at his side.</p>\\n<p>Lillian found what she was looking for, triumphantly holding up a bottle and needle.\\xa0 She withdrew a dose, then rose, approaching from around the bed, hesitating a little at the sight of Gordon fighting the graft-monster.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHere!\\u201d Mary called out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut-\\u201d Lillian started.\\xa0 \\u201cDose is for <em>her.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHere!\\u201d Mary said, more insistent.\\xa0 Her first shouted statement had drawn a glance from the creature.\\xa0 Not having success against Gordon, seeing Mary with nary a chair to protect herself, it started to reorient, moving its arms in preparation to stab.</p>\\n<p>I saw Lillian look, pausing, not sure what to do, eyes on the space over the experiment\\u2019s shoulder that she needed to lob the needle through, knowing an errant throw could hit a wall or the ceiling, or that a moving arm could swat the thing aside.</p>\\n<p>I snatched the needle from her hand, then moved forward, ducking low to cast it along the hardwood floor.</p>\\n<p>Gordon, in a last-ditch effort to save Mary from being impaled on a half-dozen points, twisted the chair.\\xa0 One or two arms were still caught in it, or caught between rungs and the seat of the chair, and the creature reacted, turning its attention back toward him.</p>\\n<p>Mary had the needle, and brought it up into the creature\\u2019s abdomen, pressing the syringe.\\xa0 One free hand, then the other, went up to catch at three of the thing\\u2019s \\u2018elbows\\u2019, holding them at bay, to reduce it\\u2019s range of movement.</p>\\n<p>It took only a few seconds for the dose to work.\\xa0 It collapsed, landing across its creator\\u2019s body, helping to pin her down.</p>\\n<p>The girl on the floor coughed, as if the cough could bring air into her lungs.</p>\\n<p>She couldn\\u2019t quite look at Gordon, who practically straddled her, or at Mary, who was behind, so she looked at us, alarmed and confused.</p>\\n<p>I looked away, my attention on the bag, pulling a free syringe from the spot where Lillian had taken the first, then grabbing the tranquilizer.\\xa0 I pushed both into Lillian\\u2019s hands, distracting her from the young lady we\\u2019d just assaulted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 With Lillian now measuring a dose, me busy with the bag and Lillian, urging our medic forward, Helen was the only one left with our captive\\u2019s attention.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re in no danger.\\xa0 We just need you to sleep for the rest of the night.\\xa0 You\\u2019ll wake up on the floor, safe and sound.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The young woman opened her mouth to talk, and only wound up coughing again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you have friends that would come looking for you?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you\\u2019re missing at dinner?\\xa0 Or after?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The girl frowned, then after a pause, she nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t lie,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She looked up at me, concerned, heaving in wheezy breaths.\\xa0 I\\u2019d only been guessing, but her reaction to me calling her on it was telling.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s a no,\\u201d I told Gordon.</p>\\n<p>He nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cWe have an escape route if we need it.\\xa0 Place to hide out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary partially opened the door.\\xa0 \\u201cOne-sixteen.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cRemember that,\\u201d Gordon said, to the rest of us.</p>\\n<p>Lillian approached our captive with a needle in hand.\\xa0 I saw the girl tense up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTyphomine,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cThirty three point four milligrams, for a person that weighs eleven stone.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Our captive took that in, then relaxed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn your side,\\u201d Lillian said, bending down, pushing at the girl\\u2019s shoulder.</p>\\n<p>The girl obeyed, twisting her upper body until she was lying on her side.</p>\\n<p>When Lillian reached out with the needle, a hand went up.\\xa0 Gordon grabbed it, holding it down, and Lillian stuck the young woman in the stomach.</p>\\n<p>In moments, she was asleep.</p>\\n<p>Lillian grabbed a pillow from the bed and put it under the woman\\u2019s head, then another, propped behind her back.</p>\\n<p>Gordon looked impatient by the time she was done.\\xa0 Lillian gave him a nod, as if to confirm that she was done.</p>\\n<p><em>Think what you want, Gordon, that would have been far harder without Lillian</em>, I thought.\\xa0 I handed her her bag.</p>\\n<p>Mary peeked out into the hall, then gave us the go-ahead.</p>\\n<p>The hall was largely empty.</p>\\n<p>We moved as a group.\\xa0 Helen, Gordon, Mary, and I were quick to slip into our roles.\\xa0 We walked comfortably, casually.\\xa0 Stealth was good, staying out of sight and being quiet, but the next best thing was to look like we belonged.\\xa0 Moving with purpose, briskly enough that it looked like we knew what we were doing.\\xa0 If we looked lost, then others would want to give us direction, or question what we were doing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTurn right,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow the heck do you know where we\\u2019re going?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPhotos in the yearbook, outline of the school, what we saw from outside.\\xa0 It feels like common sense,\\u201d Jamie said, quiet.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s kind of scary,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know you could pull out anything you\\u2019d seen, but connecting the pieces, now?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have your thing, you practice it.\\xa0 I have my thing,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cNot that I\\u2019m <em>positive, </em>mind you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBetter than nothing,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 Then, not for the first time, he said, \\u201cWish I had that brain of yours.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Jamie said, quiet.\\xa0 \\u201cMaybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary couldn\\u2019t have made the connection.\\xa0 Even Lillian probably wouldn\\u2019t have remembered, it was so long ago I wasn\\u2019t even sure Lillian had been with us.</p>\\n<p>No, the very first time they\\u2019d had the exchange had been one of our earliest meetings.\\xa0 When the Lambs had just made the move from being three to being <em>four</em>, Jamie joining our ranks, we had been learning what each of us were capable of.</p>\\n<p><em>I wish I had your brain</em>.</p>\\n<p><em>I wish I had your body.</em></p>\\n<p>If <em>I</em> remembered the interplay of dialogue between Jamie and Gordon, then Jamie had to, right?</p>\\n<p>Odd, that he hadn\\u2019t brought it up or used the line.\\xa0 He was acting odd in a few ways, as a matter of fact.\\xa0 Jamie looked tense, and a side effect of that tension was that he was too stiff, not quite the casual air we needed.</p>\\n<p>I knew that this particular situation made him the fish out of water.\\xa0 Improvising wasn\\u2019t his strong suit, because improvising required fast reactions and adaptation.\\xa0 But shouldn\\u2019t that have made him more willing to lean on us, stick to the tried and true, the interplay, the jokes, the reminder that we were a team?</p>\\n<p>I poked him in the side.\\xa0 He flinched, doubling over a little, then shot me a look.</p>\\n<p>I rolled my shoulders, then stretched, fingers together, arms over my head with palms up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 He seemed to force himself to relax.</p>\\n<p>It solved the immediate problem, but it didn\\u2019t solve the rest of it.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t sure what was up with him.</p>\\n<p>Double doors at the opposite end of the hallway banged open, a small herd of young ladies in fashionable clothing coming through.\\xa0 Their hair was nicely done up, and the clothes were <em>nice</em>, high quality, though not loud or attention-getting.\\xa0 They were fitting the atmosphere of the school, unconsciously adapting.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore girls visiting their rooms before dinner,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cBefore long we\\u2019re going to be surrounded.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBeing surrounded is bad.\\xa0 It\\u2019s less chance for us to see Fray before she sees us,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Gordon agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s get out of sight.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThrough the doors, hard right, then stairs, down,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>There was a heavy set of double doors just like the one the collection of Dame Cicely\\u2019s students had come through.\\xa0 Gordon and I each pushed one of the doors open.\\xa0 We rounded the corner.\\xa0 There were more rooms to either side, but the hallway was short, and at the end of it were two sets of stairs, one leading down, the other leading up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s downstairs?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLabs.\\xa0 They\\u2019re almost always downstairs,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what the layout is, but I doubt they\\u2019re going to be too busy if people are going from class to their rooms for dinner.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo guarantees,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>If Fray saw us and bolted-</p>\\n<p>Footsteps on the stairs marked someone or multiple someones coming down the stairs.\\xa0 We were too far away to make a run for downstairs, too far forward to try and slip through the doors.</p>\\n<p>Immediately, as we\\u2019d done with the young woman in her dorm room, we looked for our exits.</p>\\n<p>Six of us, and four of us had the wherewithal to check nearby dorm rooms, hoping some were unlocked.</p>\\n<p>No luck on all four counts.\\xa0 Stupid school with its scheming, paranoid students.</p>\\n<p>The girls came down the stairs, and I found myself saying a mantra in my head, as if I could will it to be true.\\xa0 <em>Don\\u2019t be Fray.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t be Fray.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t be Fray.\\xa0 Especially don\\u2019t be Fray\\u2019s killer monster man.</em></p>\\n<p>The young women were in the company of their pet monsters and stitched, chattering with one another.\\xa0 None were Fray.\\xa0 Nor the monster.</p>\\n<p>But there was one more experiment than there were human girls.</p>\\n<p>The stitched girl from Fray\\u2019s entourage carried a tray of kettle, plates of tidbits and cups.\\xa0 She saw us and stopped so suddenly that it startled the girls in her company, porcelain rattling on the tray, tea slopping over the side, threatening to spill.</p>\\n<p>It was a still tableau.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s you!\\u201d she said, staring at us.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/stitch-in-time-4-5/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>I approached Miss Genevieve Fray.\\xa0 Being as short as I was, I had to hop up onto a snow-dusted flower box to look over the railing.\\xa0 It would have been ignoble to be staring through the bars while she looked over them, for one thing, and by stepping up, I was more on her level.</p>\\n<p>That felt important, somehow.</p>\\n<p>It was the style for well-to-do people, man and woman alike, to wear long coats.\\xa0 Ms. Fray wore a short black coat, reaching only down to her belt.\\xa0 It was a style that was reserved more for people who were more active and those who worked with their hands.\\xa0 That wasn\\u2019t to say she looked\\xa0<em>poor</em>.\\xa0 Her hair was nice, though some of it was caught beneath a crimson scarf, as if the scarf had been put on as an afterthought.\\xa0 She wore a black skirt short enough to reveal her knees, which were covered in patterned red stockings, and she was absentmindedly scuffing at the snow with the toe of one of her heeled black boots that didn\\u2019t look particularly good for running in.</p>\\n<p>She gave me a sidelong glance, suggesting she\\u2019d known I was studying her, or she\\u2019d expected me to be.\\xa0 Her lips turned up in a slight smile.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are the terms?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis conversation.\\xa0 We should negotiate how we\\u2019re doing this.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe can\\u2019t have a simple conversation?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think so,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhy not?\\u201d she asked, and she sounded disappointed.\\xa0 I\\u2019d expected her to be more guarded, hiding her emotions, but she wasn\\u2019t.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause you keep responding with questions, keeping me on my back foot,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She smiled again.</p>\\n<p>I waited, letting her resume the conversation.\\xa0 How she did would tell me a great deal.\\xa0 If she took her time, that was more time for the others to address the other problem and find me.\\xa0 They would be worried when I didn\\u2019t turn up, which wasn\\u2019t good, but it was helpful.</p>\\n<p>Below us, the water rippled.\\xa0 At the very edges, where it wasn\\u2019t rushing as much, the water had frozen into a thin layer.\\xa0 The back of a serpentine creature rose up, moved a short distance, and then sunk, making some of the more fragile ice at the sides break away.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s sluggish,\\u201d Ms. Fray commented.\\xa0 \\u201cHm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wasting time?\\xa0 Idle chatter?\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t about to complain, up to a point.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWinter.\\xa0 Scales suggest cold blood.\\xa0 It probably wants to be hibernating,\\u201d I suggested.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s it, Sylvester,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>She didn\\u2019t finish the statement.\\xa0 I wondered if she was baiting me to ask, to take control of the conversation.\\xa0 Hayle did that a lot, I knew.\\xa0 I opted to remain silent.</p>\\n<p>Win-win.\\xa0 I wasn\\u2019t going to get so hungry for details on her that I let my guard down.\\xa0 Better to compose myself, think everything through, and catch my breath after all the running.</p>\\n<p>She raised her hands to her face and blew on them, rubbing, before leaning on the railing with her elbows, hands clasped.\\xa0 \\u201cI prefer this to having the Hangman or the Whelps after me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that so?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt gets lonely, having the company of a voltaic maid and Warren.\\xa0 I gave him his tongue back, but he doesn\\u2019t like talking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My face remained stoic, but my mind was shouting at her.\\xa0 <em>What in the world are you doing!?\\xa0 Handing me details?\\xa0 Expressing a vulnerability?\\xa0 I would never do such a thing in your shoes!</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou contrived to bait me here to talk because you were <em>lonely</em>, of all things?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI didn\\u2019t know it would be you.\\xa0 I was expecting Gordon, I think.\\xa0 Or a group of you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat were you going to do if it was a group of us?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSame thing I\\u2019m doing now.\\xa0 Try to have a conversation,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>Conversation.\\xa0 It kept coming back to that.\\xa0 Did she have a plan of attack?\\xa0 A monster of a statement she could drop on me or <em>us</em> and use to disarm us?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis is a lot of trouble to go to to have a conversation,\\u201d I noted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\xa0 But fugitives go to a lot of trouble doing anything.\\xa0 You should know that much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I raised my eyebrows.\\xa0 She turned her head away from the creek and the Kensford streets on the other side of the water to see my reaction.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve read my file.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was striving to be a professor, but you\\u2019d know that much.\\xa0 Toward the end, when they had whittled the number down to four candidates, they handed us some files.\\xa0 Academy weapons, for Radham, and for the neighboring towns.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNeighboring towns?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere are strategically located villages and towns near Radham each have their own weapon and a caretaker or team.\\xa0 You didn\\u2019t know that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been to the Academy\\u2019s dungeons?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI prefer to call that area the Bowels.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cYes.\\xa0 The towns on the periphery are the same, but an opposite concept.\\xa0 One weapon, Academy Doctors to manage it and keep things in working order, forever advancing or replacing it.\\xa0 If something goes wrong, well, there\\u2019s a lot of open space and not too many people to get caught up in the resulting mess.\\xa0 The Academy handed us files, on those towns, on\\xa0the Academy\\u2019s resources, on\\xa0<em>you</em>.\\xa0 We were told to familiarize ourselves with them, and we were later surprised with questions.\\xa0 Not to test our knowledge, but to test our abilities as potential professors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2018What would you do differently\\u2019, that sort of thing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cThat sort of thing.\\xa0 Very dangerous questions, when one is dealing with the sort of people that become professors.\\xa0 A test of our ability to be politicians as well as scholars.\\xa0 How well did we use the time they gave us to prepare?\\xa0 I know one man twice my age got removed from consideration because he only studied the material he was given.\\xa0 I was asked to look at your files, I spent a lot of time dwelling on them.\\xa0 On you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I thought over her statements for a little while: the minor revelation, the fact that she kept revealing things about herself without giving anything in return.</p>\\n<p>Was there a trap gathering around me as we spoke?\\xa0 Did she have underlings or resources?\\xa0 Creations?</p>\\n<p>The little alcove was silent and mostly still.\\xa0 There was a path to the left, running along the side of the little river, with railing beside it, but it was straight, and I could see someone approaching from a mile away.\\xa0 The other path, to the right, was where I\\u2019d come from.\\xa0 It connected at an angle, making it hard to see down without walking over.\\xa0 The building behind us was a small restaurant or coffee shop, which probably used this space as an outdoor patio for guests in warmer weather.\\xa0 If I squinted and peered through the window, I could make out an older woman wiping down something like a counter or table, holding silverware in one hand.</p>\\n<p>Suspicious, but I had a hard time seeing her as a threat.\\xa0 It was easier and more subtle to simply hide someone on either side of the window or door.</p>\\n<p>I wondered if she was waiting for something to take hold and incapacitate me, but I couldn\\u2019t imagine how I might be dosed.\\xa0 It was just cold enough that there wouldn\\u2019t be any moisture in the air to hold vapors,I hadn\\u2019t ingested anything, and I hadn\\u2019t touched anything and then touched my face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to put a face to the name,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI feel the same way,\\u201d I told her, carefully.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did you think, the first time you heard about me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you mean?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnswering a question with a question?\\u201d she asked, smiling. \\u201cI think you said something about that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I had, and the accusation was apt.</p>\\n<p>I wasn\\u2019t about to admit that my first thought had been about a possible <em>connection</em>.\\xa0 That whoever she was, she was bound to be closer to me than any long lost sibling that turned up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought it would be fun,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 Not a lie, but not the answer to her question.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhen they first picked you, the idea was to use the formula from the Wyvern files until they found a hard limit.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou knew,\\u201d she said, more to herself, as if it answered a question.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019d already been subjecting myself to more than the prescribed amount before I read your file.\\xa0 I bartered for them, then started making my own.\\xa0 Seeing that you\\u2019d survived gave me permission to increase the dosages.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe difference between us is that you\\u2019ve been dosed regularly since you were six.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been taking the doses for seven years, and have been matching or exceeding your doses for four of those years.\\xa0 After reading your file, I thought about you regularly, especially during and after my injections.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat were you thinking?\\xa0 Poor kid?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn a way.\\xa0 I was envious, isn\\u2019t that strange?\\xa0 You got to take the doses from an earlier point, you got to decide how you shaped yourself, more than anyone else.\\xa0 Decide what to focus on, mold your being, decide what things you wanted to be good at and be excellent at those things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I was picking on every word, looking for manipulation.\\xa0 Was this the trap, the attack?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t get me wrong, I <em>hated</em> the doses.\\xa0 The headaches, the nosebleeds, the way my entire body seemed to want to shut down.\\xa0 But I had a choice.\\xa0 I thought about what it was like for you, quite a bit.\\xa0 Whether they dragged you there, kicking and screaming.\\xa0 But then I asked myself, if you really hated it, would you have gone back willingly, after running away?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She had me pegged.</p>\\n<p>It bothered me.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t that she\\u2019d gotten straight to the heart of a matter that only Jamie had managed to analyze me on, but that this was so lopsided.\\xa0 The progression of the conversation wasn\\u2019t what I\\u2019d expected.\\xa0 She revealed too much.\\xa0 There was no back and forth, no innuendo, no traps that I\\u2019d been able to spot.</p>\\n<p>She was clearly capable, if she could connect the dots this accurately, bait me here like this and keep me from going for the throat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAt the age of six, we believe, children start to break away from their parents.\\xa0 Before six, we\\u2019re a sum total of our environments and our biology.\\xa0 After six, we start to step away from that.\\xa0 I wondered a great deal about whether being dosed would play into that, and which direction it would go.\\xa0 It\\u2019s very exciting to meet you, after so much speculation.\\xa0 I\\u2019m going to be thinking about this meeting for a long time.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was gushing a little.</p>\\n<p>An act?\\xa0 Or genuine?</p>\\n<p>She was showing so many vulnerabilities, it was like she was baring her throat, jugular right at my fingertips.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you think?\\u201d\\xa0 I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cNow that you\\u2019ve met me?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m dearly wishing I could have become a professor,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI would have loved to meet you for tea and cookies, and have had long conversations.\\xa0 I think that would have been nice.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She reached out, and I reacted, twisting away, hand touching the inside of my jacket to find the knife Mary had given me.\\xa0 In a moment, I was a step back, the point of the knife an inch from her hand and wrist.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was only going to stroke your hair,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo thank you,\\u201d I replied, thinking of poisons and worse.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOf course.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d\\xa0 A blue-ringed tentacle reached out from within her jacket sleeve, touched the flat of the blade, and pushed it down.\\xa0 \\u201cPlease?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I let my arm slowly drop as she pushed, the blade still in my hand.\\xa0 My eye noted her right hand, concealed between her stomach and the railing, with needles extended from the space between her fingers and nails.</p>\\n<p>When the knife was down, she relaxed, facing the railing again.\\xa0 her right hand went up to fix her hair, and the needles weren\\u2019t there anymore.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t take her eye off me, though she faced the water.\\xa0 She stared at me through the corner of her eye until I sheathed the knife, then relaxed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou were expecting to talk to Gordon, or the group,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat were you expecting to talk about?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Not quite asking what she wanted to talk to <em>me</em> about, but it might provide hints.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWith Gordon, I would ask him what he remembered of his time before he was a Lamb, and how he remembered it.\\xa0 I would ask him what he plans to be, as someone who could be so very good at anything and everything.\\xa0 I would ask him if he was living his life to the fullest, without actually asking him that.\\xa0 Do you know, Sylvester?\\xa0 Why I\\u2019d ask him that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s going to die,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m genuinely surprised they told you, or that he shared that information with you.\\xa0 I didn\\u2019t imagine someone who would accept pity.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>They didn\\u2019t tell me.\\xa0 He wouldn\\u2019t</em>.\\xa0 I kept my face still to avoid betraying the thoughts.\\xa0 I wanted her to see right through me as I opened my mouth to reply.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s reality.\\xa0 Everyone dies.\\xa0 Is this your plan of attack, Ms. Fray?\\xa0 You confront us with facts we already knew and dealt with on our own?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She shook her head.\\xa0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t have a plan of attack, Sylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My eyes narrowed.\\xa0 \\u201cEvery conversation is an attack, in a way.\\xa0 Everyone wants something, even if it\\u2019s to be understood or paid attention to.\\xa0 To do that, we attack the other person, predict them, identify where they\\u2019re coming from, where they stand, and where they want to go.\\xa0 Done well, it\\u2019s a dance.\\xa0 Those are the best conversations.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre we dancing?\\u201d she asked.</p>\\n<p>I frowned.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh.\\xa0 <em>I</em> thought we were having a good conversation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said, again.\\xa0 I tried to articulate it.\\xa0 \\u201cNo, and I can\\u2019t tell if it\\u2019s because you\\u2019re terrible at this or if it\\u2019s because you\\u2019re that much better than me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAt?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThis.\\xa0 The standoff, dialogue with an enemy.\\xa0 You brought me here for a reason, you had something you wanted to achieve, but you\\u2019re not fighting for it.\\xa0 You\\u2019re making small talk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI see.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve each been taking the Wyvern formula, roughly for the same durations.\\xa0 We each decided on the strengths we wanted to highlight.\\xa0 You highlighted yours to fill a need in your group.\\xa0 The gap that Ashton was meant to fill.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The name caught me off guard.\\xa0 She seemed to notice.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI read all the files, Sylvester.\\xa0 The Lambs were supposed to have a counterpoint to Helen, your Galatea.\\xa0 They would work as a team, each one with different social strengths, both actors beyond compare, a work by Ibott and a work by a team, derived from his first version of the Galatea.\\xa0 Gordon is likeable by virtue of his attractiveness and keen social sense.\\xa0 Helen is likeable because her personality was built to be such.\\xa0 Ashton would have been likeable for entirely different reasons.\\xa0 You\\u2019re filling the gap.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve become adroit with the interpersonal.\\xa0 You had to.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you took the Wyvern formula, but you didn\\u2019t have to?\\xa0 I don\\u2019t believe that.\\xa0 You had to navigate the bureaucracy, you were just talking about the political side of being a professor.\\xa0 You passed the test and answered the questions about what they were doing wrong without making enemies.\\xa0 No, I don\\u2019t believe it at all.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBelief, you said it twice, \\u2018believe\\u2019.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing.\\xa0 You sound upset.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re patronizing me.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a peeve of mine.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not patronizing you, Sylvester.\\xa0 I did good work, I built up my skills working with experiments it would otherwise take whole teams to see to the end.\\xa0 I did build up skills for the challenges outside of the lab, but negotiation and manipulation weren\\u2019t priorities.\\xa0 Strategy and long term planning were.\\xa0 I removed my enemies one by one, and ensured the weakest possible candidate was my opponent in the final selection.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you failed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled a little.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s some consolation that they ended up with a poor professor.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re lying to my face, Genevieve Fray,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ve killed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re one to talk,\\u201d she retorted.\\xa0 Her eyes were sparkling with emotion.\\xa0 Excitement.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re <em>angry</em>, you\\u2019ve been more brutal than necessary-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAgain, the Lambs are no better or worse.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re working with an agenda.\\xa0 You have a plan.\\xa0 You could have gone to a lot of different places, but you came <em>here</em>, when you could have run to a place where the Academy didn\\u2019t have as strong of a grip.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat if I wanted the challenge?\\xa0 Our brains were made pliable with the Wyvern formula, but pliability still means they need external stimuli to change.\\xa0 Couldn\\u2019t it be that I would have stagnated in a place where there wasn\\u2019t a concrete threat?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re not showing me your true face.\\xa0 The face that you wore when you put weaponized needles under your fingernails, or ordered Whelps killed and a threat written in blood on the wall.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think this is the side of you that acts smart, planning, smiling and acting nice, handling all of the day to day tasks.\\xa0 But unless the head you stole away with ended up being very nasty, I think there\\u2019s a bloodthirsty part of Genevieve Fray you\\u2019re only barely holding back, a dangerous, barbaric side.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She sighed.\\xa0 Her breath formed a cloud in the air.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to show you that side of me just yet, Sylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m glad.\\xa0 I doubt I\\u2019d survive it,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 My heart was pounding all of a sudden.\\xa0 Excitement and fear.\\xa0 \\u201cBut can we at least stop pretending it doesn\\u2019t exist?\\xa0 It\\u2019s insulting.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d she conceded.\\xa0 \\u201cYou made three mistakes in your assessment, though.\\xa0 Very telling.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that so?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFirst of all, you said that this part of me is smart, the planner, methodical.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m flattered, and I\\u2019d agree.\\xa0 But in saying it like you did, you suggested the other side me isn\\u2019t smart.\\xa0 You\\u2019re a planner, you\\u2019re careful because you\\u2019re weak, and you\\u2019re biased because of it.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t respect instinct or ugliness.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cInstinct and ugliness.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t able to evade you this long because I used my head, Sylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou used instinct?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 Ugliness.\\xa0 A savage brute of a man who swings his weapon recklessly and unpredictably can be a worse enemy for a trained fighter than another trained combatant,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019ll take the bait.\\xa0 What was the second mistake?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cImplying that the first side of me, this side, isn\\u2019t dangerous.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs this where you reveal that by simply being here, I\\u2019ve fallen into a trap?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo, Sylvester.\\xa0 We\\u2019re here to have a conversation,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not denying there\\u2019s a trap.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re safe, Sylvester.\\xa0 That won\\u2019t stay the case, I think we will find ourselves at each other\\u2019s throats eventually, but there is no greater plot at work, closing in on you as we speak.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Assuming I believe you</em>, I thought.\\xa0 I studied her, trying to peer past the expression to see the more brutal side that lurked beneath the surface.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThird.\\u201d she said, and it was a statement unto itself.\\xa0 \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t a duality.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not one of the Balfour Academy soldiers, drinking a potion to become virile, ugly, and monstrously strong.\\xa0 There isn\\u2019t a lever inside me that determines which of me you\\u2019re talking to at once.\\xa0 A knife can cut or stab.\\xa0 The label doesn\\u2019t change.\\xa0 It\\u2019s still a knife.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you\\u2019re still Genevieve,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo.\\xa0 This is a declaration of war,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I saw her react, and quickly added, \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s a conversation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She smiled.\\xa0 \\u201cYou could take it that way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou wanted to satiate your curiosity before you started acting against us in earnest.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat isn\\u2019t untrue, though my curiosity is hardly sated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd if you\\u2019re doing that, then the gambit with the pills is nonsense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know the train schedule, I know how the pills work, I made them,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI knew I had time to get some answers.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She reached into an inside pocket, then held up a bottle.\\xa0 It was very, very similar to the one Helen had had.\\xa0 Filled with purple pills, again, subtly different.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t tell at a glance whether they were different in a way that made them more similar to the pills I was used to or less.</p>\\n<p>My memory wasn\\u2019t that strong, and it didn\\u2019t help that the bottle was fogging up in the cold, so soon after being warmed and dampened by the heat radiating off of her body.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wondered if you were slave to them,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cIf the regular injections from an early age froze you at a point where you couldn\\u2019t or wouldn\\u2019t rebel, and if you remained nothing more than the sum total of your environment and physical makeup.\\xa0 Not to belittle you, of course.\\xa0 You could be that and still be marvelously complex, given your experiences thus far.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDo you think I\\u2019m a slave, Genevieve?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think you have other reasons.\\xa0 So, right now, I\\u2019m going to tell you that I can provide the pills that would free you from Radham.\\xa0 I can help you extend your lifespans.\\xa0 Give me that challenge, and I will throw myself at it, wholeheartedly.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve been dosing myself with the Wyvern formula, and it\\u2019s no trouble to double up the stock and provide you with a share if you want it.\\xa0 I can spare Jamie from his appointments, and keep the rest in working order.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not inclined to break people like Briggs is.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, this is what you were getting to?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m a little disappointed.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t be.\\xa0 I already know you\\u2019re going to say no.\\xa0 I\\u2019m hoping you tell me why.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBecause that\\u2019s a death sentence, as sure as any the Academy bestowed on us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe could handle anything they send at us, I think you know that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen why?\\xa0 I can give you more years.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you wouldn\\u2019t give us <em>hope</em>.\\xa0 Every day, the Academy learns things.\\xa0 Journals and articles are shared from all over the world, from places the Crown operates.\\xa0 Every month, at the very least, there\\u2019s a breakthrough, something that raises eyebrows.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou think a breakthrough will save you?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI believe in what Hayle is trying to do,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She nodded slowly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe wants to discover a better brain.\\xa0 That brain will help uncover something even better, and so on down the line.\\xa0 I believe in what humanity can accomplish, and I believe that there <em>is</em> an answer.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd in saying that, you give me yours,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 She sighed again, then rubbed her hands, blowing on them.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt breaks down to hope, I suppose,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFor someone who analyzes others so well, you don\\u2019t do very well with yourself, Sylvester.\\xa0 I suppose that\\u2019s a matter of self preservation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat do you think it is, then?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said the word yourself.\\xa0 Over and over.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned a little.\\xa0 \\u201cMy memory isn\\u2019t my strongest trait.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt was in the file.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>We stood like that.\\xa0 I watched as the thing in the water did a lazy somersault.\\xa0 It stayed belly up for a few seconds too long, enough for me to wonder if it had died, starting to float belly up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think it goes without saying, but if you ever decide to turn against the Academy, all you have to do is say the word,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you won\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I remained silent.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou asked me if I thought you were a slave,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cYour answer was a good one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to put you to sleep now,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI know fighting isn\\u2019t your strongest trait, again, it was in the files.\\xa0 Can we do this neatly, without too much mess?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I tensed, freezing.\\xa0 My hand was open, and the position of the knife flickered into my mind.</p>\\n<p>I reached for it, stepping back and to the side, to get behind her, buying time to act.</p>\\n<p>The tentacles reached out, catching my arm before I could get the best grip on the knife.</p>\\n<p>I twisted, trying a move I\\u2019d seen Gordon do.\\xa0 I passed the knife to my other hand, nicking a finger on the blade as I caught the handle too high, then punched the knife at her midsection.</p>\\n<p>She stopped the blade with her other palm, and it went through.\\xa0 I saw pain on her face.</p>\\n<p>She shoved her hand further toward me, impaling her hand more, and then coiled her fingers inward, a needle springing out to pierce the hand that held the knife.</p>\\n<p>One foot on my chest, kicking me back and away.\\xa0 The tentacles were slow to let go, and I stumbled, collapsing against the railing.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t remember passing out, but when I woke up, I was propped up beneath the eaves of the little restaurant, I had a short black coat draped over me, and the cut on my finger was neatly bandaged.</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/07/04/stitch-in-time-4-6/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>I tried to rise, and found my body\\u2019s movements sluggish.\\xa0 I slumped down, my head against the wall, chin against my collarbone, arms in front of me, Genevieve\\u2019s coat draped over me, cap pulled down, scarf and collar protecting much of my face.</p>\\n<p>I stared at the mended cut on my finger.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t move or call out, so I didn\\u2019t try.\\xa0 I put my hand under the coat and pressed my hands between my thighs for warmth.</p>\\n<p>The tranquilizer\\u2019s effects were still heavy in my body.\\xa0 Few drugs were potent and localized to one area, and any drug had to be potent to get past my Wyvern-given resistances.\\xa0 She had put me out for long enough for her to move me, patch me up, maybe see to herself, and then make her exit.\\xa0 Now I was feeling the side effects.\\xa0 Fatigue lingered, and where it sat heavy in my stomach, I felt a growing need to heave out my stomach\\u2019s contents.</p>\\n<p>Considerate as she\\u2019d been, she hadn\\u2019t left me anything for the unsettled stomach.</p>\\n<p>Nothing left to do but wait and contemplate.</p>\\n<p>Contemplation over the discussion with Genevieve soon left a bad taste in my mouth that had nothing to do with my nausea.\\xa0 Like the nausea, though, it was a vague feeling I couldn\\u2019t put my finger on.\\xa0 The moment I did, and I suspected that it was a moment I wouldn\\u2019t have much control over, I knew I\\u2019d feel a lot worse.</p>\\n<p>She\\u2019d dictated where and how the conversation happened.\\xa0 She\\u2019d told me remarkably little, and I knew that was entirely on purpose.\\xa0 She had also achieved her goal, which was to get to know <em>me, </em>and perhaps to declare war.</p>\\n<p>The more I thought about it, the more vague and nebulous the cohesive whole seemed.</p>\\n<p>What she\\u2019d said and what she\\u2019d demonstrated in our interactions were at odds.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t that she\\u2019d lied, but the presented Genevieve Fray was false.</p>\\n<p>False in a very specific way.</p>\\n<p><em>Why are you here, engaging with us?\\xa0 You\\u2019re not bored, not exactly, and you wouldn\\u2019t be so passive if you were, you\\u2019d want to test that brain of yours against us.\\xa0 You\\u2019re not pinned down, I refuse to believe that it would be so easy.<br/>\\n</em></p>\\n<p>I felt a prick of pain and moved my hands to see.\\xa0 A tiny bead of blood was squeezing out of the corner of the glued seam.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been clenching my hand hard enough to push it out.</p>\\n<p>Time passed, my thoughts meandered, and I periodically tested my strength, finding it greater with time, even as I got colder.\\xa0 I reached a point where I was fairly certain I could stand, but decided to stay sitting, so I wouldn\\u2019t get ill.</p>\\n<p>I did hitch myself backward so I was sitting up more against the wall, instead of having my head bent forward.\\xa0 No reason to be <em>more</em> uncomfortable.</p>\\n<p>I was in that state, waiting for my stomach to settle down more than I was waiting for my strength to return, when Gordon appeared from the same direction I\\u2019d come.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy!\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>He was halfway to me by the time I\\u2019d maneuvered my hand from beneath the coat and raised it in a small wave.</p>\\n<p>He looked agitated, and dropped to my side, caught between multiple actions.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m okay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cGet the others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He nodded, twisted around, raising two fingers to his lips, and let out a shrill whistle.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat happened?\\u201d he asked.\\xa0 \\u201cTrap?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI met Fray.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd we talked, and then she drugged me, and then she left.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been looking for you for fifteen minutes, and we spent a bit running from Fray\\u2019s goon.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe Headsman.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI refuse to call him that,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t get to name this one.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cJerk.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMoron.\\xa0 You should have signaled us when you found her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShould\\u2019ve, could\\u2019ve,\\u201d I said, sounding about as dejected as I felt.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou talked to her, though?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGet anything?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The eagerness in his eyes and voice was painful.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBetter if you wait for the others before sharing,\\u201d he told me.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cBut you can tell me what happened with you guys.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI could, but there isn\\u2019t much to it.\\xa0 They feigned that they were defending a building, the goon cornered us, used a mix of something to fill the area with smoke, then came at us, full-barrel, heaving furniture and crashing through doors.\\xa0 He could see us just a bit better than we could see him, but that bastard was <em>massive, </em>he didn\\u2019t need to see, he just barreled in, fists swinging.\\xa0 Mary and me, <em>we</em> needed to see to be effective.\\xa0 It put us on a back foot.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYeah, funny how that works, isn\\u2019t it?\\xa0 Felt like I was watching out for all the traps and tricks, everything I needed to do to keep Fray from getting the initiative, but when I look back on it, I don\\u2019t feel like I ever had it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a curious look.</p>\\n<p>When he didn\\u2019t say or do anything, I raised an eyebrow as a way of questioning him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou okay?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh, I\\u2019m fantastic, as you can tell,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re being sarcastic, so you can\\u2019t be <em>that</em> bad off,\\u201d he told me.\\xa0 \\u201cExplain that part in more depth when you dish to all of us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I nodded, though I really didn\\u2019t feel like elaborating on that count.\\xa0 Whatever.\\xa0 \\u201cYour thing.\\xa0 Keep going.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe tried to wait it out, waited for <em>you</em>, Helen and Mary climbed around to go after him and the stitched girl from above or behind, whichever.\\xa0 The bastard said something about lighting a match, warning us to get away, because the smoke would catch fire.\\xa0 We backed off, he struck the match.\\xa0 We weren\\u2019t even close to the building, and the woof of flame knocked us all on our asses.\\xa0 He went running off while we were still getting our bearings.\\xa0 Jamie says he thinks the guy had the stitched in a box?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFray\\u2019s plan, you think?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t know enough to say,\\u201d Gordon told me.\\xa0 He clenched his fist, gesturing inarticulately for a second before releasing it.\\xa0 \\u201cI feel like we could have done better, but I can\\u2019t say anything to any of them because I know <em>I</em> could have done better.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTeamwork?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cI hate even saying it.\\xa0 But if you\\u2019ve got something\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ve got something,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen it was worth it,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 I could see the tension go out of his neck and shoulders.\\xa0 His voice dropped as he murmured to himself, \\u201cThat\\u2019s good.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan you stand?\\u201d he asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBe gentle,\\u201d I told him.\\xa0 \\u201cSlow.\\xa0 Unless you want me to heave all over the both of us.\\xa0 Whatever she gave me is sitting bad.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cOf course.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He was strong enough and I was small enough that he could pick me up, one arm under each armpit, and he could do it slowly, giving me time to get my feet under me, my hand on the wall behind me to steady myself.</p>\\n<p>When I was standing, one hand on his shoulder for support, he turned and gave another long, sharp whistle.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn case they couldn\\u2019t figure out the direction,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I replied.</p>\\n<p>Lillian appeared and rushed to my side.\\xa0 Mary was with her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told you it was the right direction,\\u201d Mary was saying, as they drew into earshot.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d Lillian said.\\xa0 \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t <em>positive</em> you were wrong, geez.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Geez</em>,\\u201d Mary said, teasing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t talk to me if you\\u2019re going to be grumpy,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m being grumpy?\\xa0 You\\u2019re being grumpy,\\u201d Mary accused.</p>\\n<p>They reached us.\\xa0 Lillian looked at us, clearly flustered, she looked between us.\\xa0 \\u201cSy?\\xa0 You look-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDrugged,\\u201d Gordon interjected.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c-Awful.\\xa0 Drugged?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBy Fray,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I saw alarm on Lillian\\u2019s face in the same moment I saw hope on Mary\\u2019s.\\xa0 Mary clasped her hands in front of her, almost in unconscious prayer.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI need to look you over, everything, anything could be wrong, if she dosed you with something-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDid she say anything?\\xa0 Did you find out-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGirls,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe should find a place to get Sy\\u2019s clothes off.\\xa0 I should do a full checkup.\\xa0 Do you feel nauseous?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian,\\u201d Gordon said, stern.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSee?\\xa0 <em>Anything </em>could be wrong, and there\\u2019s one big what-if that\\u2019s very likely, very dangerous, and needs immediate attention.\\xa0 If she can recreate the pills, which we aren\\u2019t sure she <em>can\\u2019t</em>-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet Lillian do what she needs and then talk.\\xa0 Sylvester, if you keep me in suspense on this, I will draw a knife and give you a second belly button.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes your stomach feel firm?\\u201d Lillian jumped in.</p>\\n<p>Gordon clapped a hand over Lillian\\u2019s mouth.\\xa0 He reached for Mary\\u2019s, but she slapped his hand aside, backing up a half-step.\\xa0 He settled for pointing at her, stern.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t want a second belly button,\\u201d I said, in a small voice, mostly to lighten the mood.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t <em>you</em> start,\\u201d he told me.</p>\\n<p>Lillian used both hands to pull Gordon\\u2019s hand down and away.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019ve each been impregnated with modified glucose chains.\\xa0 It\\u2019s why you need the pills.\\xa0 If she found a way to unravel them, which she <em>could</em>, if she has pills, he could be breaking down right now, bleeding on the inside.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m <em>pregnant</em>?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>Gordon slapped me across the head.\\xa0 He turned, batted Lillian across the head, with considerably less force, then did the same to Mary, who furrowed her brow and bent her head to let it happen.\\xa0 Probably for the sake of fairness and to be a part of things.</p>\\n<p>Then he turned and swatted me again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHey!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He held up his hand in warning.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou did me twice, for no reason at all!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He smacked me again.</p>\\n<p>I opened my mouth to protest further, and he drew his hand back.</p>\\n<p>I folded my arms.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester was tranquilized,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cDon\\u2019t rush to conclusions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf he\\u2019s nauseous, we can\\u2019t ignore that,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou can get Sy naked and check him out as soon as we get someplace warm, and we can do that as soon as the others catch up.\\xa0 They\\u2019re coming right now.\\xa0 Until then, take his word for it when he says he\\u2019s feeling okay,\\u201d Gordon said, his finger pointed at Lillian.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI never said naked,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>The finger wagged in her direction.\\xa0 She pressed her lips together.</p>\\n<p>Gordon was right, though; Jamie and Helen were halfway down the long, straight alley, opposite the end the others had come down.\\xa0 Jamie looked like he\\u2019d been running a moment ago.</p>\\n<p>Gordon moved his finger to point to Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cSy can tell us what happened on the way, and while Lillian\\u2019s looking over him.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve held back my curiosity this long, you can do the same.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary made a \\u2018hmph\\u2019 sound, sticking her hands in her pockets.</p>\\n<p>He pointed at me.\\xa0 \\u201cBe quiet.\\xa0 I know you\\u2019re riling them up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThen I shouldn\\u2019t mention the blood dripping out my pee hole, or the fact that Fray is-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He smacked me, way harder than was necessary.\\xa0 One of my eyes teared up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe was joking about the blood, right?\\u201d Lillian asked, cutting Mary off before Mary could say anything.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me a \\u2018see?\\u2019 look.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cJoking, joking.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Helen and Jamie joined us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this about getting Sylvester naked, warm and checking him out?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cI heard you from a distance, but I\\u2019m <em>pretty</em> sure that\\u2019s what you said.\\xa0 Is there anything you need to tell us, Gordon?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHa ha,\\u201d Gordon said, unamused.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd Fray?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cYou said her name?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy\\u2019s health takes priority,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe need to get indoors.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned around, reached, and knocked on the window.</p>\\n<p>It took some time, but the woman who\\u2019d been cleaning tables inside appeared at the window, and she gave us a look.\\xa0 I made a pleading gesture, hands pressed together, and she gave me a very unimpressed look.</p>\\n<p>She looked at <em>Gordon</em>, who was holding up a wallet, and relented.\\xa0 The door that opened to the patio opened, and she let us inside.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAre you open?\\u201d I asked her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 But you can order something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe want to check my friend out for frostbite, can we get six of whatever you have that\\u2019s warm to drink?\\xa0 And a bite to eat?\\xa0 Cake or pie?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI have slices of cake and I have slices of pie, prices are on the board over the counter,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cCarrot, vanilla, and chocolate cake, meat pie, wildberry pie, apple pie, stone nut pie\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCake,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cChocolate, please?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI thought you were feeling sick?\\u201d Lillian asked, hands going to her hips.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s <em>chocolate cake,</em>\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She nodded, accepting that as fact.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll have a stone nut pie,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWildberry pie, please,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would like a Vanilla cake, please,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCarrot cake, please\\u201d Lillian said, hands dropping from her hips.</p>\\n<p>The woman\\u2019s arms folded as she looked at Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cChocolate cake?\\u201d he asked, cringing a little.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI just cleaned up, it\\u2019s late, and I\\u2019m not going to serve each of you something different,\\u201d the woman said.\\xa0 \\u201cDecide on one thing.\\xa0 Two at most.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It took us ten seconds of quick haggling to hash it out.\\xa0 Gordon spoke up, \\u201cFour slices of chocolate cake, and two slices of apple pie?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The woman nodded, leaving to get our order.</p>\\n<p>Lillian wasted no time in beginning to pull my clothes off.</p>\\n<p>I would have made a joke, but I wanted to maintain my one-bellybutton status.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFray was waiting for me.\\xa0 Or for any one of us.\\xa0 I was the one who stumbled on her.\\xa0 The rest of it was a distraction, to keep the rest of the group away so we wouldn\\u2019t mob her or whatever.\\xa0 She invited me over for a chat.\\xa0 I obliged.\\xa0 We talked, she tranquilized me, Gordon found me a little while after I woke up.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat did you talk about?\\u201d Mary asked.\\xa0 She was sitting on a chair, perched like she was going to leap over and create my new bellybutton if I wasn\\u2019t quick to answer.\\xa0 Too much killer instinct, suppressed for too many weeks.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMy memory isn\\u2019t that good,\\u201d I started.\\xa0 I was forced to pause, raising my arms to help Lillian pull off my sweater and shirt.</p>\\n<p>Mary didn\\u2019t leap on me, but a knife had appeared in one hand in the moment the sweater obscured my vision, the rest of her not having moved a hair, like a magician producing a card.\\xa0 She toyed with it.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t like she would <em>really</em> stab me, but her point was clear.\\xa0 She was dead serious when it came to this.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut we talked about the fact that she knew who we were.\\xa0 She\\u2019s studied us, the Academy made her, and she has a sense of what we are and how we function.\\xa0 We talked about the Wyvern formula, about the effects, the side effects, and how we each developed while using it.\\xa0 She says she didn\\u2019t develop skills as a manipulator or a people reader, but I\\u2019m not sure that\\u2019s true.\\xa0 She did develop skills as a strategist, to make her way in the upper echelons of the Academy, but I think we already knew that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The others were hanging on every word.\\xa0 Lillian prodded my neck and chin.\\xa0 I resumed speaking the moment I was free to.\\xa0 \\u201cFray mentioned Ashton, to give you a sense of how well she knows us.\\xa0 She likes us, she\\u2019s <em>interested</em> in us, and I think\\u2026 I\\u2019m revising my opinion of where we stand on the pill situation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou don\\u2019t think she swapped out the pills.\\xa0 It was a ruse,\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think she swapped out the pills,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow sure are you?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p><em>Eighty percent</em>, I thought.\\xa0 <em>But if we fail here, if we go back to the Academy while it\\u2019s under new leadership, return to doing the interviews in the Bowels and other dreary activities, a black mark of failure on our records\\u2026</em></p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d already come to the conclusion while lying on the patio, waiting for the tranquilizer\\u2019s effects to subside.\\xa0 We couldn\\u2019t afford to go back.\\xa0 We couldn\\u2019t leave it at this and run.\\xa0 It would destroy us as surely as our bodies breaking down on us.\\xa0 It was just be more drawn out, less noble.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNinety five percent,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Gordon hissed in a breath through his teeth, long and slow, then exhaled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not sure,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou think there\\u2019s a five percent chance you\\u2019re wrong.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not.\\xa0 If any of you have instincts telling you we should go home\\u2026\\u201d\\xa0 I trailed off, almost hoping someone else would make the call and take the responsibility out of my hands.\\xa0 Not entirely hoping, but almost; the thought of getting this wrong on either front made the sick feeling come back.</p>\\n<p>Nobody spoke up.\\xa0 The burden was on my shoulders.</p>\\n<p>There was a variety of looks in their eyes, but there remained a moment where I could look at each of them and interpret their expressions as <em>knowing</em>, acknowledging exactly what I\\u2019d done and why I\\u2019d done it.</p>\\n<p>Eighty percent wasn\\u2019t enough of a certainty to make us stay.\\xa0 We would\\u2019ve had to go, and we would have all known it was the wrong choice.</p>\\n<p>The lie was better, and maybe there was a mutual agreement that the lie existed.</p>\\n<p>Maybe I was imagining it, deceiving myself in believing the unspoken agreement existed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe made an offer.\\xa0 To take us in, use her knowledge and skill to keep us in working order, as long as possible.\\xa0 Give me my Wyvern formula, let Jamie stop his appointments, and so on down the line.\\xa0 She would provide the pills we needed to survive away from the Academy.\\xa0 There were other promises.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said no?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI said no, yeah,\\u201d I told him.</p>\\n<p>He nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe made it out to be about freedom from the shackles of the Academy, but that\\u2019s not how it works, is it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 She paused as the woman from the little restaurant arrived with a tray of tea, cake, and plates.\\xa0 Mary kept talking, though the woman was in earshot.\\xa0 \\u201cI realized it early on.\\xa0 There isn\\u2019t really any escape.\\xa0 I went from Mr. Percy to you guys, and it\\u2019s better, but I\\u2019m not <em>free</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll pour the tea, miss,\\u201d Helen said.\\xa0 \\u201cThank you so much.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Lillian handed me back my shirt.\\xa0 I pulled it on in a second flat, then began untangling my sleeves from my sweater as Lillian found her seat.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t make a mess, I don\\u2019t want to spend any time cleaning up after you,\\u201d the woman warned.</p>\\n<p>Gordon handed her a fold of bills.\\xa0 She stood there, counting, before walking to the counter, apparently satisfied.</p>\\n<p>The cake, pie, and tea was doled out.\\xa0 I had little doubt everyone was weighing the heavy issues at hand even as we prepared for our little feast.</p>\\n<p>The conversation resumed in low voices.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI love Professor Ibbott,\\u201d Helen said, with less inflection than I\\u2019d heard from her in a long while, \\u201cI don\\u2019t like him.\\xa0 I wouldn\\u2019t be happy if I never saw him again, but I wouldn\\u2019t be sad either.\\xa0 I do what he says and I\\u2019m good.\\xa0 I\\u2019m a work of art and I do what he tells me to so I act like one too.\\xa0 If we walked away from the Academy and I had someone else telling me what to be, it wouldn\\u2019t be any different.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcept we\\u2019d be in more danger,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cThe Academy would come after us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWas that what you said?\\u201d Lillian asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThat you wouldn\\u2019t go because it would be the same?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat would have offended her, I think,\\u201d I replied.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t usually stop you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou offend <em>us</em>.\\xa0 Why not her?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn the time between when I woke up and when you found me, I did a lot of thinking,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cCouldn\\u2019t do much else.\\xa0 I realized that I hadn\\u2019t been cutthroat enough.\\xa0 That she played me.\\xa0 She read me, she figured out what I wanted, and she came at me <em>soft</em>.\\xa0 Gentle, friendly, vague, without threatening me at all.\\xa0 She went out of her way to avoid challenging me, because she probably knew that I\\u2019d rise to the challenge, and I\\u2019d take that a step further to come after her.\\xa0 I spent the entire time floundering and not realizing why,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The table was quiet.\\xa0 The Lambs sipped tea, stared, or ate their pie and cake.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll admit it right here,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI lost, back there.\\xa0 I learned things about her, but she went out of her way to tell me only what she was willing to let me know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary\\u2019s gaze was the hardest to meet.\\xa0 She took failure so personally, and I knew she\\u2019d been pinning hopes on me getting something out of our collective encounter with Fray and her people, so her loss against the Headsman would mean something.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou said you found something out,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cWas it only what Fray wanted you to know?\\xa0 Or did you figure out something else?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI think I figured out something else,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI asked her why she was here, challenging us.\\xa0 Why didn\\u2019t she leave?\\xa0 She never gave me a straight answer.\\xa0 She presented only one side of herself, and she kept the violent, confrontational part of herself hidden.\\xa0 She controlled how we encountered her, but there was no guarantee we wouldn\\u2019t be a little bit faster, that she wouldn\\u2019t be up against <em>all</em> of us at once.\\xa0 That means she had an <em>out</em>.\\xa0 Something she could have said or done that would have let her escape, if we came after her hard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw Helen steal a bit of Jamie\\u2019s cake, while Jamie\\u2019s attention was focused on me.\\xa0 As thievery went, it was blatant, cutting the cake with the fork, then spearing a chunk the size of her fist.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you thinking, Sy?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m thinking we should contact the Academy.\\xa0 If the pattern holds, they\\u2019re sending reinforcements here, to investigate and give chase, for when we go back for our appointments.\\xa0 Maybe the Hangman, again, maybe Dog and Catcher.\\xa0 Except all of this, it\\u2019s a massive distraction from what she\\u2019s really doing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d Jamie asked.\\xa0 \\u201cWhat is she supposed to be doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know exactly what.\\xa0 But she has a plan in the works.\\xa0 She\\u2019s not averse to killing, but she left us alive.\\xa0 Let\\u2019s assume it\\u2019s not idle curiosity.\\xa0 That she\\u2019s not some dime novel villain.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a master plot at work, and we play a part.\\xa0 Think, what logically follows from this?\\xa0 What does she do by showing herself to me, then disappearing, maybe even staying <em>here</em>?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cI can\\u2019t guess how your mind works, or how hers does, for that matter.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s giving us hope.\\xa0 Hope that she can be found and caught.\\xa0 The Academy sends resources to assist, all the focus is on this place, this town.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd?\\u201d Mary asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd we\\u2019re not looking where she\\u2019s <em>been</em>.\\xa0 Fray isn\\u2019t <em>running</em>, or she is, but the running is a distraction, bait to lure us forward.\\xa0 What we do is we tell them to send the people back, investigate all the past locations.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are they looking for?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA weapon.\\xa0 A catalyst.\\xa0 Something catastrophic.\\xa0 She\\u2019s hiding her fangs, but those fangs are there.\\xa0 What we need to do is find her, find her fast, and we need to find out what it is she\\u2019s doing.\\xa0 She\\u2019s brimming with fury against the Academy, and everyone is going to pay for it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can draw up a quick sketch of her monster and the stitched girl,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a starting point.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe also hit up any shops that sell coats or jackets.\\xa0 She left hers with me,\\u201d I said, \\u201cBut I doubt someone who travels as much as she does has more than one.\\xa0 She\\u2019ll be buying one, I think.\\xa0 Most importantly, she\\u2019s going to be baiting us, dropping hints to keep the Academy focused on her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re sure?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLet\\u2019s not waste any time then,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>Helen made a small whining sound, mouth full of cake.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe finish our tea and cake first,\\u201d he said, with authority.</p>\\n<p>Helen emphatically nodded the affirmative.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAfter cake, we move.\\xa0 Our best bet is being aggressive when she expects us to be struggling or on the retreat.\\xa0 We catch her off guard.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were nods all around.</p>\\n<p>We helped Helen finish her cake, to her protest, cleaned up, and were out the door in two minutes, some of us still chewing.\\xa0 Gordon handed Jamie the coat to look over while we walked.</p>\\n<p>Gordon and I walked faster than the others.\\xa0 Normally I might have waited up for the others, but he had a look on his face, stern, focused.</p>\\n<p>He saw me studying him, and he relented.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would have taken the offer,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYeah.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>He shook his head, then threw an arm around my shoulders.\\xa0 \\u201cLet\\u2019s go get \\u2018er.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/07/14/stitch-in-time-4-9/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>This was, like the rattle of the doorknob, the kind of situation that demanded a coordinated response.\\xa0 When the doorknob had rattled, it had been Mary and Gordon who\\u2019d stepped forward.</p>\\n<p>This was a different sort of rattle.</p>\\n<p>Helen, Gordon and I were on point.\\xa0 Well, Gordon was always on point, there weren\\u2019t many active, immediate situations where he was <em>bad.\\xa0 </em>Much like how there weren\\u2019t many situations where Jamie and Lillian were really supposed to step up and take charge.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi!\\u201d Helen said, cheery.</p>\\n<p>Fray\\u2019s stitched alone wasn\\u2019t the biggest problem.\\xa0 Her stitched being in the company of other women and monsters made for something more complicated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing here?\\u201d Fray\\u2019s stitched asked, looking confused and mildly alarmed.</p>\\n<p><em>Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings</em>, I thought.\\xa0 A cleverer person could be invited to dance, words playing off of words and the bystanders forever kept in the dark.\\xa0 The stitched wasn\\u2019t so nuanced, and she\\u2019d chosen the single hardest question to answer directly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re taking a look at the school!\\u201d Helen said, matching the stitched girl in tone.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s so pretty!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She wasn\\u2019t lying, but even ignoring that part, it sounded so genuine <em>I</em> almost believed her.\\xa0 The problem was that it left things open, it gave the stitched girl a moment to think.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCareful,\\u201d I said, abruptly.\\xa0 \\u201cThe tray, don\\u2019t drop it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She startled a little, looking down at the tray.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t ever drop trays.\\xa0 I\\u2019m careful,\\u201d she said, voice firm.\\xa0 She hadn\\u2019t been close to dropping it, but she\\u2019d had to <em>check.\\xa0 </em></p>\\n<p>Gordon seemed to sense what I was doing.\\xa0 \\u201cHow is Genevieve doing?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh.\\xa0 Um,\\u201d the stitched said.\\xa0 A furrow appeared between her eyebrows.\\xa0 \\u201cShe\\u2019s happy, and she\\u2019s working.\\xa0 She\\u2019s with Claire right now.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were going to go see Lady Claire,\\u201d one of the girls said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said, then I took a risk.\\xa0 \\u201cWe were too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know Miss Fray?\\u201d one of the girls in the group cut in.</p>\\n<p>Hadn\\u2019t expected that.\\xa0 It was rude, sudden, and it didn\\u2019t fit into the flow of the conversation.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe do,\\u201d Helen said.</p>\\n<p>Again, she was leaving things open-ended, letting the other person decide the next part of the conversation.\\xa0 I had to have a talk with her about it.\\xa0 A casualty of Helen being largely reactive in nature.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHow?\\u201d another girl asked.\\xa0 Was her tone accusatory?</p>\\n<p>I wanted to defer to the other Lambs and let them control the flow of the conversation while I took a second to think, but I worried we were one mistake away from trouble.\\xa0 Something about the collective tone and body language.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe recommended the school to us,\\u201d I said, off the top of my head.\\xa0 It tied things back to the backstory we\\u2019d already discussed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo <em>you</em>?\\u201d was the arch reply.\\xa0 <em>To a boy</em>?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe weren\\u2019t supposed to say, Sid,\\u201d Gordon admonished me.</p>\\n<p>I flinched, but I did catch a glimpse of the confusion on the girl\\u2019s faces.\\xa0 This was a cutthroat school, one where it was every student for themselves.\\xa0 Why then, did they look at each other for confirmation or feedback?</p>\\n<p>A tight-knit group, centered around Fray?</p>\\n<p>Or were they a tight-knit group, rallying against Fray?</p>\\n<p>Either way, I had a plan of attack now.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you think she\\u2019s going to be angry at us?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon paused, not sure how to respond.\\xa0 My mistake.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>I\\u2019m</em> miffed at you,\\u201d the stitched girl called out.\\xa0 Giving her an opening to say something was another mistake.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou know her best,\\u201d Helen said, covering, and diverting focus.\\xa0 It wasn\\u2019t much, but it was something.</p>\\n<p>I nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cI guess.\\xa0 She\\u2019ll be mad, but she won\\u2019t show it.\\xa0 She\\u2019s better than that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you talking about?\\u201d one of the girls asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t say,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I was sure to say it too quickly, pausing awkwardly, feigning discomfort in the moment of silence that followed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMiss Genevieve is nice,\\u201d Wendy said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou\\u2019re not making sense.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>If these girls liked Fray, we needed to counteract that impression.\\xa0 If they disliked her, then I needed to play that up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s not a word I\\u2019ve heard people use to describe her,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>With that, two of the girls broke away from the group, their monsters following.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm,\\u201d the stitched girl said, looking at them, bewildered.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, Wendy,\\u201d one of the girls that had stayed behind said, interrupting her.</p>\\n<p>Shift the bias of the conversation.\\xa0 Recognizing that stitched tended to be slower to react or adjust in the same way Jamie was, I could override her, build up a story, and turn these girls into a weapon we could use against Fray.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s very much not okay!\\xa0 That one threw a knife at my head!\\u201d Wendy said, pointing at Mary.\\xa0 \\u201cBe safe.\\xa0 They\\u2019re dangerous!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That brought everything to a screeching halt.</p>\\n<p>She was a little faster on the uptake than most, then.\\xa0 Had to stop making assumptions when Fray was involved, even tangentially.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWendy,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re not dangerous.\\xa0 You\\u2019re mistaken.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019ve talked about this,\\u201d Lillian said, piping up.\\xa0 \\u201cYou have residual memories.\\xa0 What you\\u2019re remembering isn\\u2019t Martha, but someone very similar to Martha, from <em>before.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Clever Lillian.\\xa0 Every stitched spent some time being trained and checked for residual memories and tics before they were cleared for their duties.\\xa0 Lillian was helping to build something of a narrative, and she was helping to direct the conversation.\\xa0 In the right direction, no less.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she said, stubborn.\\xa0 \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t talked about it and that isn\\u2019t one of my memories.\\xa0 Miss Genevieve had me running all over to try and watch you and she said to be careful and then she threw a knife at my head and he pushed some bricks over so they almost fell on me, and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I wanted to slap a hand to my face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat sort of thing doesn\\u2019t happen in reality, Wendy,\\u201d Helen said, with the best gentle tone.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt does and it did!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I mused,<em> We need to move the conversation to the right destination, even if we have this anchor holding us back and threatening to sink us</em>.</p>\\n<p>Attack her stance, erode the other\\u2019s faith in her words, using the fact that she was a stitched?\\xa0 Evade and distract, maybe?\\xa0 Or approach things from an oblique angle?</p>\\n<p>I decided to play along.\\xa0 I hated doing it, but I played the <em>kid</em>.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t do that!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cWe came here because she asked us to and she says we\\u2019re going to be able to go to school here later if everything works out, and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat?\\u201d one of the girls cut me off.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s\\u2026 I wasn\\u2019t supposed to say that,\\u201d I said, for the second time.\\xa0 By this time, their curiosity had to be killing them.</p>\\n<p>The girls who\\u2019d started to approach finished crossing the floor to reach us.\\xa0 One of them dropped down to sit on her heels, reaching out to place a hand on my shoulder.\\xa0 She smiled, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay.\\xa0 You can tell us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I turned to look at Gordon, as if for reassurance.\\xa0 He shrugged, which was perfect.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe made friends with Lady Claire because Lady Claire knows someone who runs the Academy,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cShe says, if everything works out, then this won\\u2019t be a girl\\u2019s school next year.\\xa0 There\\u2019ll be men coming here, which means I can come.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>You want your precious seats?\\xa0 How would you like more competition?</em></p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t make sense,\\u201d the girl in front of me said.\\xa0 She was a pretty blonde with features that I was pretty sure had been adjusted with some Academy science.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s true,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I could have used money to drive the point home, but money held more weight with people who weren\\u2019t used to wealth.\\xa0 \\u201cShe said that Lady Claire\\u2019s dad-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUncle,\\u201d Jamie said, under his breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUncle, he\\u2019s noble, and he\\u2019s been offered a position, but the man offering the position has a daughter he doesn\\u2019t want to be studying any of this and she\\u2019s supposed to get a scholarship and-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d the girl cut off my ramble, which was very intentionally rambly.\\xa0 <em>Hit them with too many things they would want to ask questions about, all at once, leave them reeling.\\xa0 Even if they pick apart the argument, the message underlying it all still penetrates</em>.</p>\\n<p>Politics.\\xa0 I was willing to bet they\\u2019d appreciate politics more than money.</p>\\n<p>It was a lie they could believe.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t know about any of that,\\u201d Wendy said.</p>\\n<p>I could have thrown out something in response to that, but I decided to let it sit.</p>\\n<p>Helen decided to pick it up, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, honey.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Damn it.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo it\\u2019s not!\\xa0 You tried to strangle Warren!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe keeps saying that stuff,\\u201d one of the girls said.\\xa0 \\u201cIs she burning out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m quite fine, thank you,\\u201d Wendy said, stamping a little in frustration.\\xa0 The cups and saucers on the tray rattled.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe we should ask Miss Fray?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Ugh.\\xa0 That would be a disaster.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe,\\u201d said the girl, who was crouched in front of me.\\xa0 \\u201cI always wondered where she came from.\\xa0 It would be nice to know who I\\u2019m talking to, when I go down to see her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>There were a hundred things I could have said, webs I could have spun, but with this proximity to the girl, I knew it would be too much, too fast.\\xa0 We needed a subtler line, something to set the hook without giving our fish reason to struggle.\\xa0 Besides, I was playing the kid, matching Wendy in the innocence angle.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t deliver anything too cutting without drawing too much attention to me.</p>\\n<p>From Helen and Gordon\\u2019s silence, I suspected they sensed the same thing, and they were deferring to me.</p>\\n<p>It was the wrong hand signal, but I feigned fidgeting, putting my hands behind my back, knowing the others could all see it, and I extended two fingers, \\u2018walking\\u2019 them upside down.</p>\\n<p>The rabbit ears in the grass, the upside down man.\\xa0 It was a sign that meant \\u2018sneak\\u2019.\\xa0 Paired with another sign, it could mean \\u2018subtly\\u2019.\\xa0 I pointed at my lower face.</p>\\n<p>Mary started to move around to the side, slowly.\\xa0 I made a sudden gesture, clenching my fist, shifting my posture.\\xa0 She stopped, and she watched as I emphasized mouth, not neck.</p>\\n<p>No, I didn\\u2019t want an ambush.</p>\\n<p>I wanted-</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI overheard my dad, once,\\u201d Jamie said, hesitant.\\xa0 That wasn\\u2019t acting, it was just Jamie being Jamie, but it <em>worked</em>.\\xa0 \\u201cHe said, that lady isn\\u2019t someone you would ever want to marry or have as a business partner, but if you want to learn science and learn politics, there aren\\u2019t many people better to learn from.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs that so?\\u201d the girl in front of me asked, her voice soft.</p>\\n<p><em>Jamie, I could kiss you right now</em>.</p>\\n<p>He could be slow, but he was the furthest thing from stupid.\\xa0 He understood how I thought.\\xa0 All he needed, sometimes, was the time to get caught up and connect the dots.\\xa0 When he got that, then he could be devastating.</p>\\n<p>With those words, he\\u2019d poisoned the waters.\\xa0 So long as we maintained some semblance of cover, all future interactions between these girls and Fray would be colored by distrust and concern about being manipulated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re supposed to learn from her, this coming spring,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cOur parents all arranged it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s Lady Claire\\u2019s tutor,\\u201d the other girl who\\u2019d approached us said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh, yeah,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cI guess we\\u2019ll be her students too?\\u201d</p>\\n<p><em>Take the bait, take the bait</em>\\u2026</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHere?\\u201d the girl in front of me asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIn Radham,\\u201d I said, firmly enough to leave no doubt.</p>\\n<p>She reached out, and her monster, a man with armor-crusted skin, extended a hand for her to hold on to as she straightened up, standing.</p>\\n<p><em>It doesn\\u2019t make sense, does it?\\xa0 How could she be a proper tutor for Lady Claire here and a tutor for us there?\\xa0 </em><em>Something doesn\\u2019t add up, and you\\u2019ve already suggested you\\u2019re suspicious of her.\\xa0 You were vaguely hostile and almost predatory when you sussed out a connection to her, which suggests you don\\u2019t like her.\\xa0 You\\u2019re willing to believe the worst.</em></p>\\n<p><em>She\\u2019s selling out the school, making it co-ed, she\\u2019s selling you all out, all in the name of politics.\\xa0 To top it all off, she\\u2019s manipulating Lady Claire to make it happen.</em></p>\\n<p>This was the story we\\u2019d spun out.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m <em>very</em> eager to talk to this woman now,\\u201d the blonde girl who\\u2019d talked to me said, her back to us.\\xa0 She approached the stairs.\\xa0 \\u201cOnly thing that doesn\\u2019t add up is this stitched girl.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI add up!\\u201d Wendy said, indignant.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour story doesn\\u2019t.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh.\\xa0 I thought you meant arithmetics.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs she running hot?\\u201d the blonde asked.</p>\\n<p>Another girl reached out and put a hand on Wendy\\u2019s forehead.\\xa0 \\u201cA little warm.\\xa0 Not enough for a burn-out.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI just made tea,\\u201d Wendy said, very patiently,\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m holding tea.\\xa0 It\\u2019s warm, because tea is hot.\\xa0 I\\u2019m telling the truth.\\xa0 They\\u2019re dangerous.\\xa0 All six of them.\\xa0 Miss Genevieve told me to be very careful with them.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d the girl said, withdrawing her hand from Wendy\\u2019s forehead.\\xa0 \\u201cWe can go and ask Miss Fray, and I think everything will become clear.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d the blonde agreed.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m looking forward to the explanation.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t ideal \\u2013 I\\u2019d hoped to have more time.\\xa0 But we had a distraction, in the form of several angry girls, we had the element of surprise.\\xa0 All we needed to do was corner her, then draw the net closed.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you say something about us to her, we\\u2019re going to get in trouble,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>The blonde turned her attention briefly to me.\\xa0 I <em>liked</em> the look of deep-seated concern on her face, as if I\\u2019d struck a blow to the core of her being, shaking her confidence.\\xa0 This was someone proud, good at what she did, and with my lies, she was no longer sure that she knew what the future had in store for her.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019ll be discreet,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 A lie, practically to my face.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t care.</p>\\n<p>The motivation that drove her now was stopping Fray and securing her future once again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d I said, pretending to accept the lie.\\xa0 I moved closer to the stairs as they started to gather, ready to move on Fray as a group.\\xa0 I wondered if they\\u2019d be direct or subtle about it all.\\xa0 I couldn\\u2019t tell from the body language or the murmured words they were exchanging.</p>\\n<p>The blonde one looked so much angrier.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t stride forward.\\xa0 She <em>stalked</em>, her pet with its armored skin a step behind.</p>\\n<p>Conventional wisdom was that a lie was best kept simple.\\xa0 Less conventional wisdom was that a lie could be trumped by a more complex one.</p>\\n<p>The Lambs and I were close.\\xa0 My eyes were on Wendy, Fray\\u2019s stitched girl.\\xa0 She was confused, she kept trying to talk, and nobody was listening.</p>\\n<p>I almost felt bad.</p>\\n<p>The group turned and moved as a unit, heading downstairs to where Genevieve Fray and Lady Claire supposedly were.</p>\\n<p>Like Jamie was so prone to be, the stitched girl found herself a step behind.</p>\\n<p>I lurched forward, hurrying, as she moved around the railing to head downstairs.\\xa0 Pushing her down would be crude, but getting in her way-</p>\\n<p>She stumbled a little, the cups and saucers clattering once again.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cExcuse me!\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s already getting cold.\\xa0 I\\u2019m in a hurry!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSorry,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cLet me get out of your way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I faked right, then moved left.\\xa0 She stumbled again, then stamped a foot, clearly frustrated.</p>\\n<p>At the base of the stairs, one of the girls called up, \\u201cWendy, are you coming?\\xa0 And Sid, was it?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes!\\u201d Wendy called back.\\xa0 She shot me a glare.\\xa0 \\u201cExcuse me.\\xa0 I need to serve the tea, and I need to tell Miss Genevieve that you said things that weren\\u2019t true.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d Mary said, catching me off guard by speaking up.\\xa0 \\u201cSid?\\xa0 It\\u2019s okay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I frowned, but I saw her smile.</p>\\n<p>I stepped out of Wendy\\u2019s way, freeing her to go down the stairs.</p>\\n<p>She took one step, then jerked to a halt.\\xa0 Tea slopped out of the cups.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm,\\u201d the stitched girl said.\\xa0 She tried to turn around, then stopped again.\\xa0 \\u201cUm.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Mary had tied her to the railing.</p>\\n<p>She looked at me, very clearly frustrated and maybe a little lost at this point.\\xa0 \\u201cWould you please take the tray?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I shook my head.</p>\\n<p>She tried to put it on the railing, balancing it, then gave up, taking hold of it again.\\xa0 Several times, she tried to move, and found herself caught firm.</p>\\n<p>All she had to do was throw the tray, but, as she\\u2019d proudly told us, she didn\\u2019t drop trays.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUm,\\u201d she said, looking more distressed.</p>\\n<p>Gordon reached out, putting a hand on her arm.\\xa0 \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI can\\u2019t move,\\u201d she said, her voice small.\\xa0 She sounded like she had regressed in age.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s okay,\\u201d he said, again.\\xa0 \\u201cI know.\\xa0 Just wait.\\xa0 Things will be okay.\\xa0 You have to be patient.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She tried to move again, then stopped short.\\xa0 She went still, shoulders drawn in.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re not going to hurt you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cStay here.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll get you help, okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She nodded.\\xa0 \\u201cBut the tea is going to get cold.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I started down the stairs, several of the others with me.\\xa0 Only Gordon hung back, consoling the stitched girl.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou have the teapot, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d Gordon asked.\\xa0 \\u201cThey like second cups, after the first is done?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne teabag,\\u201d she said, \\u201cSo it isn\\u2019t too strong when it\\u2019s time for the second cup.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGood remembering,\\u201d he said.\\xa0 \\u201cDo you drink tea?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not very good for me.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSid,\\u201d Gordon called out.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d just reached the bottom of the stairs, I turned around, and so did many of the others.</p>\\n<p>Gordon spoke, his voice carrying down the stairwell.\\xa0 The school was quiet enough we could hear it, even with his low volume.\\xa0 \\u201cThree cups.\\xa0 One for Fray, one for Claire, and\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne for Fray\\u2019s monster,\\u201d Mary said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHis name is Warren,\\u201d the stitched girl said.\\xa0 \\u201cAnd he\\u2019s not a monster!\\xa0 He\\u2019s a gentleman and I\\u2019m supposed to help him!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s down there with them?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Nobody responded.\\xa0 We were already moving on.\\xa0 Gordon took the steps, two at a time, leaving the stitched girl behind.\\xa0 We had a problem.\\xa0 Fray\\u2019s man was a monster the rest of the gang hadn\\u2019t been able to take down in a square fight.</p>\\n<p>We moved carefully, checking before any movement, not daring to move in front of a door in case Genevieve Fray or someone else spotted us.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSent everyone down here,\\u201d Gordon said, under his breath.\\xa0 \\u201cWhy?\\xa0 Couldn\\u2019t you have sent them away?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was a gamble,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cYes, I could have sent them elsewhere, but it wouldn\\u2019t have been easy.\\xa0 They were already heading down there, it was the place to go for answers, and they definitely wanted some, with Wendy back there drawing a connection and raising big questions.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMmm,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHoped her monster would be off on an errand, trying to deal with us, or getting maintenance, or <em>something</em>.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSure things are better than gambles, Sy,\\u201d he said, under his breath.\\xa0 \\u201cBetter to step away and find a more concrete avenue of attack.\\xa0 Keep it simple.\\xa0 \\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt <em>was</em>.\\xa0 That was as simple as I do.\\xa0 I considered everything and it made the most sense.\\xa0 Put her on her heels, pressure her, find an opportunity to strike, when she isn\\u2019t expecting us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWell, let\\u2019s hope it happens,\\u201d he said, and he said it in a way that made it sound like I\\u2019d failed somehow.</p>\\n<p>Jerk.\\xa0 He\\u2019d <em>just</em> been talking to me about how the group needed to work together.</p>\\n<p>We creeped forward, and in the midst of it, I felt Mary bump my arm with her elbow.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t say or do anything, but we moved forward as a pair, arms touching.</p>\\n<p>Solidarity.</p>\\n<p>When we drew closer to the end of the hall, we heard the voices, along with the sound of rushing water.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s conning you, Claire.\\xa0 Can\\u2019t you understand that?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe\\u2019s <em>saving</em> me.\\xa0 She\\u2019s a fantastic teacher, she\\u2019s-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLying to you.\\xa0 Or are you saying she hasn\\u2019t contrived to meet your dad?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cContrived is the wrong word-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s true,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>There was a moment of shocked silence.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not like you\\u2019ve been led to believe.\\xa0 Dame Cicely\\u2019s Academy isn\\u2019t anything I\\u2019m after, and I don\\u2019t know anything about it wanting to allow men in.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDon\\u2019t know anything?\\xa0 I don\\u2019t believe you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did approach Lady Claire as a means to an end, but that was temporary.\\xa0 I became her friend in a genuine way.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>A pause.\\xa0 I was sure that if I looked, I could see Fray putting on a show.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou became her so-called friend, and you\\u2019re leaving, just like that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI- yes.\\xa0 Sooner than I\\u2019d like.\\xa0 But that\\u2019s not an entirely bad thing, Joan.\\xa0 I know you have a great admiration-\\u201d a brief but meaningful pause, \\u201cFor Lady Claire.\\xa0 I would be delighted to invite you into one of our study sessions, so you could take over for me when I\\u2019m done.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI- What were your ulterior motives, Genevieve?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh, that.\\xa0 It\\u2019s complicated.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>What to do?\\xa0 We had her cornered.\\xa0 She was busy defending herself.\\xa0 But she also had her pet in there with her.\\xa0 A brute of a man with keen enough instincts to stay ahead of the rest of the Lambs.</p>\\n<p>Mary was next to me, back pressed to the wall, much as mine was.\\xa0 I reached over, and I tapped the side of her leg, touching the blade that her skirt hid.\\xa0 I touched my throat, then jerked a thumb in the direction of the room.</p>\\n<p>She made a so-so gesture.</p>\\n<p>Not confident?</p>\\n<p>I stepped away from the wall, pulling on her sleeve, swapping positions with her and gestured for her to wait.</p>\\n<p>Better if she was closer to the door, in case something happened.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wanted <em>access</em>,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cSomething I\\u2019ve been lacking since I lost the Academy\\u2019s favor.\\xa0 That\\u2019s why I first approached Lady Claire.\\xa0 The nobility and upper class offer that access.\\xa0 I thought I could play the game, work my way to a secure position.\\xa0 But I\\u2019ve always had a weakness for <em>people</em>.\\xa0 I\\u2019m bad at reducing them to simple numbers or abstracts.\\xa0 I get too close to them.\\xa0 Friend or foe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI hope I\\u2019m a friend,\\u201d someone said.\\xa0 Lady Claire, most likely.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMost definitely,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>Nothing suggested she was lying, prompting me to wonder, <em>what did you want access for</em>?\\xa0 <em>Or to</em>?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI almost believe you,\\u201d said the blonde.\\xa0 Joan, if I was guessing right.\\xa0 \\u201cThose children you\\u2019ve worked with-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My heart sank.\\xa0 I saw Mary tense, a throwing knife in hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMore people I\\u2019ve gotten too close to.\\xa0 Or they\\u2019ve gotten too close to me,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think they\\u2019re upset with me.\\xa0 They\\u2019re distorting the truth.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know if they realize how much they\\u2019re doing it.\\xa0 Isn\\u2019t that right, Sylvester?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>My blood ran cold.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester?\\u201d Lady Claire asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOne of the children.\\xa0 I\\u2019d lay good money on the fact that he\\u2019s out in the hallway, listening.\\xa0 Messy black hair, small, sharp eyes?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe was called Sid by one of the others.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cA fake name.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSays the fugitive from the Crown,\\u201d I called out.\\xa0 \\u201cYou used your real name?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI lose track if I lie,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m no good at that.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFugitive?\\u201d this from one of the young women.\\xa0 She sounded alarmed.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t like flying blind.\\xa0 I put a hand on Mary\\u2019s shoulder, then stepped out into the doorway.</p>\\n<p>The lab was stone walled and stone floored, lit by voltaic lights that flickered just a touch.\\xa0 Biologic power often did that.\\xa0 Fish or something else that could be fed and produce the power.\\xa0 The floor was thick glass, and water moved below, churning and frothing.\\xa0 The light reflected off the floor and the water to make it look like the entire room was underwater.</p>\\n<p>I saw Fray\\u2019s monster.\\xa0 Eight feet tall, his shoulders so broad I could have draped myself over them and still not covered the breadth.\\xa0 All muscle, exaggerated, with pressed clothes that had no doubt been tailored to his specific shape.</p>\\n<p>Fray was there, with the girls we\\u2019d just been talking to.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour friends are there too, I assume?\\u201d Fray asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey went to go do something else,\\u201d I lied.\\xa0 \\u201cThink about it.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI am thinking about it, Sylvester, but I don\\u2019t think I believe you.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBefore, when we talked, I found myself wondering what you\\u2019d do if we all came after you, if Wendy\\u2019s distraction attempt had failed, or if we\\u2019d organized differently.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t suppose this is where I get to find out?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201c<em>Fugitive</em>?\\u201d Lady Claire asked, a little louder, repeating herself.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMurderer and terrorist,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I pulled out my badge.\\xa0 \\u201cWe\\u2019re tracking her down.\\xa0 For convenience\\u2019s sake, you can imagine we\\u2019re adults in the bodies of children, for the sake of sneaking around, going unnoticed, or being discreet.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you aren\\u2019t,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cConvenience\\u2019s sake,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 I looked at the other girls, and the monsters they\\u2019d brought with.\\xa0 \\u201cIf she sends her monster over there after us, I highly recommend using <em>your</em> monsters to disable or kill her.\\xa0 Be careful, she\\u2019s got retractable syringes in her fingers and a tentacled monster hidden inside her clothing.\\xa0 You don\\u2019t want to be too close to her.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw Lady Claire back away a step.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEverything I told you was the truth, Claire,\\u201d Fray said, her head bowing a little.\\xa0 \\u201cIf you think about it, a great deal of what I told you will make <em>more</em> sense, in retrospect.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re really a killer,\\u201d Claire said.\\xa0 She backed away again, startling a little as Joan put hands on her shoulders.</p>\\n<p>Genevieve Fray didn\\u2019t answer the question.\\xa0 She turned her attention to me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFray.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTo sate that idle curiosity of yours, I\\u2019ll tell you.\\xa0 Had everyone turned up on the patio outside the cafe, and if conversation had seemed impossible, I would have told you what it is I\\u2019m aiming to do.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cUh huh,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is where you tell me, then?\\xa0 Send us off to go stop your dastardly plan?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo,\\u201d she said, quiet, sounding almost offended.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 First of all, I have this situation well in hand.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The girls backed away a little more.\\xa0 They were mindful of Fray\\u2019s monster, with its eerie blue eyes and massive frame.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSecond of all, I don\\u2019t intend to give anyone a chance to stop me.\\xa0 I started and concluded my greater plot some time ago.\\xa0 Anything I do now just extends its effects and gravity.\\xa0 All the same, I think you and the other Lambs would feel compelled to run damage control.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019ve already done what you set out to do?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI did after my first stop, but I\\u2019m taking the time to secure it, make sure it does what I mean it to.\\xa0 Much like I\\u2019ve already decided <em>this</em> confrontation, and all the time we take talking is securing my position.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I tore my eyes off her, studying the room.</p>\\n<p>I\\u2019d thought, not daring to look away, that the girls with the monsters were crouching.\\xa0 But they were <em>sagging</em>.</p>\\n<p>Gas.\\xa0 Or some concoction, or <em>something</em>.</p>\\n<p>She and I were resistant to it, by virtue of the Wyvern formula, and she\\u2019d treated her creature, too.\\xa0 The rest weren\\u2019t so lucky.</p>\\n<p>Without the monsters to threaten her, there was nothing to stop the monster with the blue eyes.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWarren,\\u201d Fray said, sounding genuinely disappointed.\\xa0 \\u201cGo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p><a

<strong><a href=\"https://twigserial.wordpress.com/2015/07/18/stitch-in-time-4-10/\">Next</a></strong></p>\\n<p>I threw myself back out of the doorway, Mary moving in the opposite direction, her shoulder bumping mine.\\xa0 She threw a knife, then twisted around, her still-wet boots skidding on the floor.\\xa0 She grabbed the door and my offered hand to catch herself, than ran with the rest of us, her hand in mine.</p>\\n<p>We hurried down the hall, and I heard the briefest scraping sound.</p>\\n<p>I half-turned to see him stepping out into the hallway, a stool dangling from his hand.\\xa0 When he threw it, he didn\\u2019t bring his arm back for more distance or wind-up.\\xa0 It was a motion of the elbow and the wrist, a hard snap.</p>\\n<p>It took me a fraction of a second to see the trajectory.\\xa0 I hauled on Mary\\u2019s arm, to pull her away, and I wasn\\u2019t strong enough.\\xa0 The stool hit her and splintered against the wall in the same moment.\\xa0 Her grip tightened on my hand, and she twisted my wrist as she stumbled into Helen, who was a step ahead of her.\\xa0 Mary, Helen and I went down in a heap.</p>\\n<p>I flipped over, avoiding relying on my hand as I shifted positions to more of a crouch, my attention on Warren.\\xa0 Mary\\u2019s throwing knife glinted in the light, sticking out of his chest, a few inches deep into his chest.\\xa0 She had nailed her throw.\\xa0 Right over the heart.</p>\\n<p>Could I call that irony?\\xa0 The whole reason the Lambs even exist is that the Crown got this far, and the Crown only got this far because the Academies started making monsters that were harder to kill than conventional weapons were able to.\\xa0 By the time weapons caught up, the Academies were producing other weapons, plagues and parasites, causing the sort of problems for their enemies that only the Academies could fix.</p>\\n<p>It was that cycle and the drive to stay ahead that drove so much of the Academy\\u2019s psychology.\\xa0 Now we were, in our little skirmish here, a reversal of the dynamic the Academies had imposed.</p>\\n<p>Warren\\u2019s eyes stared as he approached.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t run, but he took long strides.\\xa0 He was slower than us, but he didn\\u2019t seem concerned with that.</p>\\n<p>Gordon gave me and Helen a hand.\\xa0 Lillian went straight to Mary.</p>\\n<p>It had been a hard hit.\\xa0 A solid wood piece of furniture had been dashed to pieces, and something that could do that could have broken something important in Mary.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWarren!\\u201d\\xa0 Jamie called out.\\xa0 With Helen, Mary and I still recovering, and both Gordon and Lillian helping us, it seemed like he was on point.\\xa0 \\u201cYour father wants you to know he\\u2019s sorry!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The musclebound man slowed, then stopped.\\xa0 He was halfway down the hallway, hunched over.\\xa0 His facial features were very normal, but he held his head at an angle that cast his eyes in shadow, the flickering light outlining his massive frame.\\xa0 As he looked at Jamie, he raised his head, and for an instant, there was less shadow.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe knows what happened to you,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cIt nearly killed your mother, hearing.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The man that was facing us down reacted to that, hunching over more, recoiling from the words.\\xa0 One fist clenched.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYour father let things slide, with the farms.\\xa0 He almost gave up, almost sold the farm.\\xa0 <em>Almost.\\xa0 </em>Your neighbors stepped in.\\xa0 The Crowleys, the Behrs.\\xa0 They\\u2019re rotating out, their adult kids have been volunteering, spending time with your dad, looking after things.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Jamie was lying through his teeth, of course.\\xa0 We\\u2019d stopped by, but the parents hadn\\u2019t talked to us, and they hadn\\u2019t been getting help, but they hadn\\u2019t been in dire shape either.\\xa0 Not happy, for sure, but not dire.\\xa0 They were a tough lot, and that unfortunately extended to Warren too.\\xa0 Probably.</p>\\n<p>Lillian said something I didn\\u2019t hear, and Gordon helped haul Mary to her feet.\\xa0 Every single inch of Mary conveyed agony on some level, with some blood here and there, the tension of her muscles, the look on her face, the tears in her eyes.\\xa0 She also looked <em>angry</em>, and I had to chalk that up to anger at herself more than anything else.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cFrances Behrs was there when we stopped in to ask about you, gathering information so we could track you all down.\\xa0 You were friends back when you were our age, right?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The question got a slow nod in response.</p>\\n<p>Was Warren there mute?</p>\\n<p>There was a pause, and I saw Jamie look my way.\\xa0 A glance, a check, and it wasn\\u2019t intended to see how hurt I might have been as it was something else.</p>\\n<p>My turn, then?</p>\\n<p>I drew in a deep breath, and I let go of my wrist, which was throbbing.\\xa0 Holding hands in front, folding arms, and crossed legs were all signs of defensiveness.\\xa0 The signals were subtle, but even the most untrained eye would read something into it.\\xa0 Holding my wrist would do so twice over because I\\u2019d be subtly reminding him of pain.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know that it feels like going back is impossible.\\xa0 Everything is different, and you\\u2019ve changed, in mind, body, and personality.\\xa0 There\\u2019s a lot there you clearly wouldn\\u2019t want to take back home.\\xa0 But your family survived this much, and they want you back, more than you know.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe door is open, Warren,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201cYou <em>can</em> go back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I felt a hand touch my back.</p>\\n<p>A signal.\\xa0 Were Gordon and Mary good to go?</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou should go back.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren turned, then stepped to one side, revealing Fray, who was a short distance behind him.\\xa0 She\\u2019d approached with his body blocking our view of her.</p>\\n<p>We backed away a little, and Warren and the woman advanced to match the distance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCover your mouths,\\u201d Lillian whispered.\\xa0 <em>In case of more gas.</em></p>\\n<p>Fray spoke, \\u201cIf I had to weigh in and say what was best for you, Warren, I\\u2019d say you should go.\\xa0 Keep them out of my hair for two hours, we can consider your part of our bargain done.\\xa0 Get a new body, see your family, piece your life back together.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She was doing it again.\\xa0 Denying me the footholds I needed to get a leg up on her.\\xa0 How was I supposed to fight her manipulations when she was <em>agreeing</em> with me?</p>\\n<p>Warren\\u2019s head bowed.\\xa0 The shadows covered his eyes, leaving only the blue reflections of the irises themselves.\\xa0 I could read it all, the body language, the hunched shoulders, the tension that seemed to settle in him.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re not going to, are you?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>He shook his head.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t help someone until they want to be helped,\\u201d Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cFor now, I\\u2019ll give you the support you need, Warren\\u2026\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren reached out without looking, and he slammed his hand into the door nearest him.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t blink as splinters flew out to decorate his custom-made outfit.</p>\\n<p>He tore out a section of the door.\\xa0 An improvised weapon.</p>\\n<p>\\u201c\\u2026Even if what he <em>needs</em> is a good target to spend his anger on,\\u201d Fray said, quietly.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou\\u2019re a better person than that, Warren,\\u201d Jamie said.\\xa0 \\u201c<em>Kids?</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Fray said.\\xa0 \\u201cAs far as I understand it, and he\\u2019s a hard man to read, when he doesn\\u2019t speak, but this is my read on it\\u2026 he sees you as symbols of the Academy, and Academy science, which is where the fault lies for what happened to him.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAnd you pretend you\\u2019re not good at being manipulative,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cPushing him to go with us, knowing that the push would make him resist, push back, back into your fold.\\xa0 Then you speak for him, you interpret things, and shape his thoughts in the process.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m not trying to manipulate him at all, Sylvester,\\u201d Fray said, still quiet.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t say or do anything in response to that.\\xa0 There wasn\\u2019t much that I could do, in terms of options.\\xa0 I\\u2019d been planting the seed for Warren\\u2019s benefit, but nothing suggested it had even gotten through to him.\\xa0 The truth of the matter was, I <em>believed</em> her.\\xa0 If she was manipulating him, it was by accident.</p>\\n<p>I studied her, watching.\\xa0 She was oddly juxtaposed with the massive brute of a man, a young woman in a sweater and skirt, with high boots, relatively soft spoken, but sharp in dress, with the crimson lipstick and hair most likely styled by Lady Claire\\u2019s best.\\xa0 He, by contrast, was loud in his silence, his body language and the threat of another flung weapon capturing my attention, dragging it away from anything else I might look at.</p>\\n<p>By the simple act of breathing, he made me watch him.</p>\\n<p>The antithesis of what the Lambs were.\\xa0 We were a group, a network, and he was utterly alone.\\xa0 We were brains, and he was brawn.</p>\\n<p>But, when I looked into those eyes and saw them <em>watching</em>, when I considered that he\\u2019d effectively taken Mary out of the fight with his first maneuver, I couldn\\u2019t think of him as brainless.\\xa0 Not like Sub Rosa.</p>\\n<p>They advanced, we retreated.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou portray yourself as nice, gentle.\\xa0 You truly care about everyone you meet,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI do.\\xa0 I grow attached too easily.\\xa0 The barriers got worn away by my Wyvern doses, along with my long-term recall.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut you\\u2019re going to make him hurt us?\\xa0 So he can have the release he needs?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m going to <em>let</em> him hurt you because I don\\u2019t believe there\\u2019s anything else I can say or do that\\u2019s going to slow you down or make you stop chasing us, and you\\u2019ve clearly reached the point where you can catch up with us.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Warren advanced a step.\\xa0 Not because he was matching the speed of our slow retreat, but because he was closing the distance.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s hand on my back moved, he grabbed my arm, and he jerked me to the side.\\xa0 A knife flew through the space my head had been, sailing through the air, and passed within a foot of Warren\\u2019s head.\\xa0 Ms. Fray stepped away from the projectile, though it was already pretty clearly going to miss.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAh,\\u201d Fray said.</p>\\n<p>Warren started forward, moving faster, and we ran.</p>\\n<p>Turning around, I had a view of the group.\\xa0 Mary was hurt, and was relying on Gordon for support.\\xa0 Something had stabbed through her sweater, and she was bleeding.\\xa0 Again, we were faster than him.\\xa0 Even Jamie.\\xa0 Would have been why Fray used the stitched girl to bait us instead of Warren, now that I thought on it.</p>\\n<p>But, much as he\\u2019d done before, he made up for the lack of speed with his raw natural ability.\\xa0 He hurled the piece of door he\\u2019d collected.\\xa0 Gordon and I were watching, and the rest of the group was ready.\\xa0 The section of door hit the ground in the middle of our group, bounced, and clipped Gordon, who nearly dropped Mary.\\xa0 I put myself under her for support, my arms around her stomach, and my wrist seized up in pain as I put too much pressure on it.</p>\\n<p>Gordon recovered, I pulled away, watching over my shoulder.</p>\\n<p>No, correction, it wasn\\u2019t that he was slower than us.\\xa0 It just took him time to build up steam.\\xa0 He was matching our speed, finding a comfortable running pace.\\xa0 The lights flickered, as they were wont to do, and there was a brief moment where only his eyes were visible.</p>\\n<p>He could see in the dark, I suspected.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHave to slow him down,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cMary-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cCan\\u2019t throw.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGive me your knives,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>She shot me a <em>look</em>, one that should have been reserved only for the worst class of people, like baby murderers or puppy-kickers.</p>\\n<p>There was a crashing sound behind us as Warren collected something else to throw.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cGive!\\u201d I said, more intently.</p>\\n<p>She reached under her shirt to her stomach and drew her hand away with three knives.</p>\\n<p>Extra knives in left hand, knife to be thrown in my right.\\xa0 Sucked, when I was a leftie, but I\\u2019d twisted it or sprained it, but I had to make do.</p>\\n<p>I spun around and hurled the first knife, hard as I could.\\xa0 The whole of my attention was on the movement, remembering what I was doing.\\xa0 <em>Focus, track, visualize\\u2026 throw.</em></p>\\n<p>The knife chipped off the ceiling above Warren\\u2019s head.</p>\\n<p>I took a second to run and catch back up with the others, while doing my best to figure out what I\\u2019d done wrong.\\xa0 <em>Later point of release, then.</em></p>\\n<p>I turned around, saw Warren holding a section of door in both hands, ready to hurl it horizontally, and shouted a warning, \\u201cDown!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>The rest of the group ducked, some stumbling, while Gordon shielded Mary with his body.\\xa0 I threw myself to the side as the spinning section of door flew past us, then went through the motions, throwing with a later point of release.</p>\\n<p>He raised his hand to ward off his face, but the knife sailed harmlessly past him, a few feet to the left.</p>\\n<p>With me stopping outright to throw and the rest of the group stumbling, he covered a lot of the distance between us.\\xa0 I could see everything that was liable to unfold, whether we ran or whether we stayed and fought, and nothing looked good.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShould have given the knives to Jamie,\\u201d Mary said, a few feet behind me, speaking under her breath.\\xa0 \\u201cAt least he might have hit something.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cResent that!\\u201d I said, my voice tense.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDitto!\\u201d Jamie said.</p>\\n<p>I passed the third knife to my good hand and took a fraction of a second to remind myself of what I\\u2019d done wrong.\\xa0 The movements were fresh in my muscle memory and mind both.</p>\\n<p><em>If </em><em>you miss, he\\u2019s going to hurt my friends.\\xa0 Make it count, Sy.</em></p>\\n<p>I hurled the knife.</p>\\n<p>It sailed past him at eye level, a few feet to the right.</p>\\n<p>A knife slashed past Warren\\u2019s face, close to the eye, and he stumbled.</p>\\n<p>I looked, and saw Gordon.\\xa0 He\\u2019d let Mary drop to the floor of the corridor, and was taking the knives she offered as fast as she could retrieve them.</p>\\n<p>Gordon\\u2019s second knife flew past Warren\\u2019s head.\\xa0 Warren raised a hand to protect his face, palm outward, and Gordon seized advantage.\\xa0 Two throws, one knife sinking into each palm.\\xa0 Not that they were small targets.\\xa0 Someone could have taken the torsos of any two lambs and stuck them together and the weight and general dimensions would have matched one of those mittens.</p>\\n<p>Two more knives.\\xa0 One miss.\\xa0 Another into the webbing between two fingers.\\xa0 They were all sinking as deep as the hilts, when they hit.</p>\\n<p>Warren was advancing, Gordon took more weapons, and hurled them.\\xa0 One knife bounced off, flying through a gap between Warren\\u2019s reaching hands and striking handle-first, the next slashed a thumb and went flying off to clatter to the floor, and the third sank into one of Warren\\u2019s palms, again.</p>\\n<p>Warren didn\\u2019t stop.\\xa0 He drew closer, and we weren\\u2019t in a position to run, with Mary on the ground and Lillian leaning over her bag, with contents strewn all over the floor.</p>\\n<p><em>He\\u2019s protective of his head.\\xa0 It\\u2019s the last part of him that\\u2019s still intact</em>.</p>\\n<p>Mary had another two knives, but as Gordon reached for one, Lillian lunged forward, knocking Mary\\u2019s hand away, pushing a bottle into place.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHead!\\u201d I shouted, as Gordon moved to throw.</p>\\n<p>The man\\u2019s hands were a wall in front of his face, and he wasn\\u2019t letting anything slip through.</p>\\n<p>Instead, Gordon tossed the bottle into the air, slightly forward, so it would hit the ground in front of him, snatched a knife from Mary\\u2019s hand, and then lunged forward, a full-body hurl of the knife, aimed for Warren\\u2019s groin.\\xa0 It hit with the blunt side, but it was still a hard throw.</p>\\n<p>Warren, it seemed, didn\\u2019t have a particular vulnerability to strikes between the legs.\\xa0 That said, no man alive wouldn\\u2019t instinctually flinch in response to that.</p>\\n<p>Gordon reached behind his back and past his shoulder, catching the bottle so it was behind him, then completed a throwing motion without ever having to stop and draw his arm back.</p>\\n<p>The bottle smashed against Warren\\u2019s face.\\xa0 The man stumbled, hands pawing at his face, and then dropped to his knees.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWon\\u2019t last long,\\u201d Lillian said.</p>\\n<p>Which was all the indicator we needed.</p>\\n<p>We turned, working together to pick up and support Mary, and then we ran, leaving Warren to paw at a door, his knife-embedded palms and fingers limiting his ability to grip.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI would\\u2019ve hit him,\\u201d I said, a little bitter that my moment of glory had been stolen.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have a week for you to learn, Sy,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThree more throws, I could have done it,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIf you\\u2019d taken three more throws, we would\\u2019ve been creamed,\\u201d Gordon said.</p>\\n<p>I didn\\u2019t have a response to that.</p>\\n<p>Glancing back, I saw past Warren, to the end of the hallway, where Fray stood.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t chase.\\xa0 She didn\\u2019t give any sign of being alarmed, concerned, or bothered.\\xa0 She simply stood there.</p>\\n<p>She had told us that she\\u2019d already completed her plan.\\xa0 She was embellishing it, or extending its reach.\\xa0 Seeing this, how she\\u2019d treated this as a whole, I believed her.</p>\\n<p>I believed that, barring exceptional circumstance, we wouldn\\u2019t catch her like this again.\\xa0 She had a hostage, with Lady Claire, and she wouldn\\u2019t make the same mistake twice.</p>\\n<p>We\\u2019d lost.\\xa0 We\\u2019d reached too far, too fast, we\\u2019d been caught off guard by the sudden appearance of the stitched girl, and everything else had flowed from there.\\xa0 We were fighting blind, because we didn\\u2019t know what our enemy was doing.</p>\\n<p>We needed a win, on so many levels, in so many ways.</p>\\n<p>I switched mental gears, away from Fray, away from Warren.</p>\\n<p>We carried on to the end of the hall, and we reached the stairs.\\xa0 A number of students were gathered around the distressed stitched girl, who was still tied to the railing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou!\\u201d she said, with much the same inflection she\\u2019d used when she had recognized us earlier.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHi,\\u201d I said, panting for breath.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cEscaped experiments on the loose,\\u201d Gordon addressed the gathered students, panting less.\\xa0 \\u201cStudents hurt.\\xa0 Get clear!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I saw a flash of expectation or excitement in the eyes of the young women who had gathered around Wendy.\\xa0 Competition removed, more seats free, and maybe a little something beyond that.\\xa0 Had Dame Cicely\\u2019s bred some sadistic streaks into the student body?\\xa0 Were they that gleeful over someone getting punished, or the spectacle that might surround such?</p>\\n<p>But they did scatter.</p>\\n<p>In the midst of our running, I\\u2019d pulled ahead to the front of the group, my attention <em>forward</em>, on what came next, the plan.\\xa0 Now, as we reached the top of the stairwell, I slowed, and the others made noises of distress and annoyance.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWendy,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou,\\u201d she said, in that same inflection as before.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cUs.\\xa0 We\\u2019re going to cut you loose in just a second, okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 Then she added, \\u201cThe tea is cold.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat are you doing, Sy?\\u201d Gordon asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cTalking to Wendy.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWarren is comi-\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWarren is the reason I\\u2019m talking to Wendy,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>Wendy frowned at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou told us you were supposed to help Warren,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMadam Howell told me to,\\u201d she said.</p>\\n<p>I glanced back at Jamie.\\xa0 He looked as surprised as I was.\\xa0 We hadn\\u2019t actually had all the information there.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s your job?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThat\\u2019s my job.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOkay,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I reached out to Mary, and she gave me another <em>look</em>, but she handed me a knife.</p>\\n<p>I cut the string that bound Wendy to the railing.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cThank you,\\u201d she said, very prim, \\u201cAnd you\\u2019re mean.\\xa0 All of you.\\xa0 You\\u2019re terrible.\\xa0 Excuse me for saying so.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re very terrible,\\u201d I admitted.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSy,\\u201d Lillian said, \\u201cI hear footsteps.\\xa0 He\\u2019s coming.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI know, it\\u2019s fine,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMe, hurt.\\xa0 I\\u2019m not fine,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 \\u201cI think something <em>snapped.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cLillian will fix you,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cRight now, our concern is <em>Warren.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>That was all it took to get Wendy\\u2019s attention.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWendy,\\u201d I said, patiently, speaking very clearly.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry we left you tied up here.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>She stared at me, concern still clear on her face.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut we did it for your safety.\\xa0 Kind of.\\xa0 People ended up getting hurt.\\xa0 There was fighting.\\xa0 Mary got hurt, and Warren did too.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cOh no.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYes.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s going to be okay.\\xa0 Because Miss Genevieve did such good work, didn\\u2019t she?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cShe fixed me up so nicely!\\xa0 Some of the big scratches, they\\u2019re gone now!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe were talking about how good her work on you was.\\xa0 And she gave Warren a body, didn\\u2019t she?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wendy nodded.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cSylvester,\\u201d Mary said.\\xa0 Her use of my full name was telling.\\xa0 The pain in her voice said a lot, too.</p>\\n<p>I could hear the running footsteps.\\xa0 Our pursuer wasn\\u2019t far, and he was most definitely coming after us.</p>\\n<p>I addressed Wendy, \\u201cI have something to ask you, and I want you to think very long and hard about this, okay?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cMaybe not so long?\\u201d Gordon suggested, putting one hand on my arm.\\xa0 I shrugged free.</p>\\n<p>I glanced at Gordon.\\xa0 Jamie was standing behind him, and Jamie was keeping his mouth shut.\\xa0 He looked spooked, but he wasn\\u2019t reminding me of stuff I already knew.</p>\\n<p>I had his trust, at least.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlright,\\u201d Wendy said, looking like she was prepared to give the next bout of thinking her full, concerted effort.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs Warren happy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHappy?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDoes he smile, does he laugh?\\xa0 Is this\\u2026 is this life good for him?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Wendy\\u2019s expression faltered.</p>\\n<p>Warren was so close, now.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe go, now,\\u201d Gordon ordered, grabbing me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou go, I stay,\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cThis is important.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cYou being with us is important!\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I looked to Mary for support, but her head hung, she was having trouble breathing, and blood was soaking through her clothes, running down her skirt.\\xa0 She wasn\\u2019t with us.</p>\\n<p>Lillian was too scared.\\xa0 Helen was Helen.</p>\\n<p>I looked to Jamie.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI\\u2019m staying too,\\u201d he said.</p>\\n<p><em>That\\u2019s not necessary, </em>I thought, but I couldn\\u2019t argue, because he was backing me up.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cDamn both of you,\\u201d Gordon said.\\xa0 \\u201cMary, give me some knives.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cNo!\\u201d I said.\\xa0 \\u201cNo.\\xa0 Just\\u2026 take Mary, get a bit of a head start, head for the room.\\xa0 Jamie, you should go too, you\\u2019re not a fast runner.\\xa0 Leave me here.\\xa0 With Wendy.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll manage.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>Gordon stared at me.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cPlease,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>He turned to go.</p>\\n<p>I looked at Wendy, and I reached up, taking the tray, before putting it on the ground.\\xa0 She looked flustered at that, but visibly calmed down as I took her hand.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat\\u2019s going on?\\u201d she asked, her voice small.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe wait for Warren.\\xa0 Just a few more seconds,\\u201d I said.</p>\\n<p>I would have been lying if I said my mouth wasn\\u2019t as dry as a bone, adrenalin thrumming through my veins.</p>\\n<p>Warren caught up, reaching the bottom of the stairs.\\xa0 He\\u2019d pulled the weapons free of his palms, and blood had been smeared from the wounds onto his clothes.\\xa0 He saw Wendy and I and he stopped.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs he happy?\\u201d I asked.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe\\u2019s unhappy because of <em>you.</em>\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cIs he really?\\u201d I asked.\\xa0 \\u201cIf I was gone, if you held me here and let him take me, would he be the same happy boy Mrs. Howell asked you to protect?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cHe wasn\\u2019t very happy then either,\\u201d she said.\\xa0 \\u201cAt the start, maybe.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>I knew Warren could hear us.\\xa0 He didn\\u2019t move, just staring.\\xa0 His reaction was more like I had a knife to the stitched woman\\u2019s throat, holding her hostage.</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t dressed, then,\\u201d she remarked.</p>\\n<p>I shot her a look, then shook my head, \\u201cDo you think he would become as happy as he was at the start, if you gave me to him?\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\u201cI don\\u2019t think,\\u201d she said, softly.\\xa0 \\u201cI\\u2019m not very good at it.\\xa0 I do what I\\u2019m
